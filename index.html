                    This suggests that face recognition ability doesn't change
                    with practice. While repeated exposure to variable images of
                    one person's face can help you to recognize them,
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211037"
                      >professional facial image comparison courses</a
                    >
                    aimed at training face identification ability have not been
                    shown to produce lasting improvements in performance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is, however, an argument for the role of natural
                    ability in face recognition. People known as
                    "super-recognizers" perform far better than the general
                    population at tests of face recognition, and have been used
                    by police forces to identify criminals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, super-recognizers could be asked to look
                    through images of wanted persons and then try to find them
                    in CCTV footage, or match images caught on CCTV to police
                    mugshots. Some of us are just better than others at these
                    types of task.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But why is it so difficult for most of us to recognize an
                    unfamiliar person across different images? We all know that
                    we look different in different pictures—not many of us would
                    choose to use our passport image on a dating website. And
                    this
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2013.800125"
                      >variability in appearance</a
                    >
                    is what makes unfamiliar face matching so difficult.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When we are familiar with someone, we have seen their face
                    many times looking lots of different ways. We have been
                    exposed to a high amount of this "within-person
                    variability", enabling us to put together a stable
                    representation of that familiar person in our minds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In fact, exposure to within-person variability has been
                    shown to be crucial for
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2015.1136656"
                      >learning</a
                    >
                    what a new face looks like. With unfamiliar people, we just
                    haven't seen enough of their variability to reliably decide
                    whether they look like the image in their photo ID.

                    Elon Musk said Thursday he has found a new CEO for Twitter,
                    or X Corp. as it's now called.

                    He did not name the person but she will be starting in about
                    six weeks.

                  <p>
                    Musk, who bought Twitter last fall and has been running it
                    since, has been insisting he is not the company's permanent
                    CEO.

                  <p>
                    The Tesla billionaire said in a tweet Thursday that his role
                    will transition to being Twitter's executive chairman and
                    chief technology officer.

                    Musk has been saying for nearly six months that he plans to
                    find a new CEO for San Francisco-based Twitter.

                  <p>
                    Introduced in 1978, the revolutionary Intel 8086
                    microprocessor led to the x86 processors used in most
                    desktop and server computing today. This chip is built from
                    digital circuits, as you would expect. However, it also has
                    analog circuits: charge pumps that turn the 8086's 5-volt
                    supply into a negative voltage to improve performance.1 I've
                    been reverse-engineering the 8086 from die photos, and in
                    this post I discuss the construction of these charge pumps
                    and how they work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] An integrated circuit starts with a silicon substrate,
                    and transistors are built on this. For high-performance
                    integrated circuits, it is beneficial to apply a negative
                    "bias" voltage to the substrate. 2 To obtain this substrate
                    bias voltage, many chips in the 1970s had an external pin
                    that was connected to -5V,3 but this additional power supply
                    was inconvenient for the engineers using these chips. By the
                    end of the 1970s, however, on-chip "charge pump" circuits
                    were designed that generated the negative voltage
                    internally. These chips used a single convenient +5V supply,
                    making engineers happier.

                    The Chinese spaceplane finally returned to Earth earlier
                    this week, but we're still learning more about its time in
                    orbit. The spacecraft caught and released an unidentified
                    object several times during its flight, performing a series
                    of maneuvers that were captured by orbital radars, according
                    to California-based LeoLabs. The company released its
                    observational data, saying in a tweet that the data shows
                    there were at least two capture and docking operations
                    performed by the spacecraft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The experimental launch vehicle took off from the Jiuquan
                    Launch Center on August 5 as a classified payload on board a
                    Long March 2F carrier rocket. This was the reusable
                    spacecraft's second time to fly, with its first launch
                    taking place in 2020. The spaceplane only stayed in orbit
                    for four days during its inaugural flight but far outdid
                    itself the second time around.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spaceplane landed on May 8 after spending 276 days in
                    orbit. The China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, a
                    state-owned manufacturer that makes both civilian and
                    military space launch vehicles, shared very little
                    information about its craft. Observers of low Earth orbit,
                    however, were able to track the spaceplane's activities
                    during its lengthy flight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In November 2022, the U.S. Space Force's 18th Space Defense
                    Squadron tracked an object that may have been ejected from
                    the spaceplane. The object remained unidentified, although
                    some speculated it may have been a satellite used to track
                    the spaceplane's performance in orbit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That same object may be what LeoLabs tracked with its global
                    network of radars. "Since its launch on 4 August 2022, we
                    observed multiple large maneuvers raising the object's
                    altitude — as well as repeated deployments, formation
                    flying, and docking of a sub-satellite Object J (NORAD ID
                    54218)," the company said in its Twitter thread.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] China's experimental vehicle operates like a regular
                    aircraft in Earth's atmosphere and a spacecraft in space,
                    allowing it to complete missions in orbit and then return to
                    Earth's surface, where it performs a horizontal landing.
                    China isn't the only country testing this type of
                    spacecraft; the U.S. Space Force has its own spaceplane. The
                    Boeing X-37 launched in May 2020 for its sixth test flight
                    and landed back on Earth in November 2022 after spending
                    more than two years in orbit.

                who is widely recognized as one of the key inventors of the
                Universal Serial Bus (USB).
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Once the design was finalized, Bhatt and his team worked
                    with other technology companies to promote and standardize
                    the USB. They formed a working group called the USB
                    Implementers Forum (USB-IF) to develop the USB
                    specification, which was first introduced in 1996.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The USB specification quickly gained widespread adoption in
                    the technology industry due to its convenience and
                    versatility, and new versions of the standard were
                    introduced over the years to improve data transfer speeds,
                    power management, and other features. Today, the USB is used
                    in a wide range of devices, and it continues to evolve and
                    improve with each new iteration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Intel initially developed the USB, it held

                    >
                    for the technology, which allowed the company to control the
                    standard and charge licensing fees for its use. However,
                    Intel soon realized that its proprietary approach was not in
                    the best interests of the industry or consumers. The company
                    recognized that the success of the USB depended on its
                    widespread adoption and interoperability with different
                    devices, which would not be possible if licensing fees were
                    required for every use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In response, Intel took a bold step and transferred
                    ownership of the USB specifications to a non-profit
                    organization called the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF). The
                    USB-IF is a group of companies that work together to promote
                    and develop the USB standard, with the goal of ensuring that
                    the standard remains open and accessible to all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Intel's decision to transfer ownership of the USB
                    specifications to the USB-IF was a pivotal moment in the
                    development of the USB standard. It helped to ensure that
                    the USB became a truly universal and open interface, which
                    has had a profound impact on the computer industry and
                    consumers around the world. Today, the USB is used in a wide
                    range of devices, from computers and smartphones to home
                    appliances and automotive systems, and it continues to
                    evolve and improve to meet the needs of an ever-changing
                    technological landscape.

                    is active between April 15 and May 27. The meteor shower
                    originates from Halley's comet, named after English

                    New images taken by NASA's Perseverance rover may show signs
                    of what was once a rollicking river on Mars, one that was
                    deeper and faster-moving than scientists have ever seen
                    evidence for in the past. The river was part of a network of
                    waterways that flowed into Jezero Crater, the area the rover
                    has been exploring since landing more than two years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Understanding these watery environments could help
                    scientists in their efforts to seek out signs of ancient
                    microbial life that may have been preserved in Martian rock.

                    Perseverance is exploring the top of a fan-shaped pile of
                    sedimentary rock that stands 820 feet (250 meters) tall and
                    features curving layers suggestive of flowing water. One
                    question scientists want to answer is whether that water
                    flowed in relatively shallow streams—closer to what NASA's
                    Curiosity rover has found evidence of in Gale Crater—or a
                    more powerful river system.

                    Stitched together from hundreds of images captured by
                    Perseverance's Mastcam-Z instrument, two new mosaics suggest
                    the latter, revealing important clues: coarse sediment
                    grains and cobbles.

                    "Those indicate a high-energy river that's truckin' and
                    carrying a lot of debris. The more powerful the flow of
                    water, the more easily it's able to move larger pieces of
                    material," said Libby Ives, a postdoctoral researcher at
                    NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California,
                    which operates the Perseverance rover. With a background in
                    studying Earth-based rivers, Ives has spent the last six
                    months analyzing images of the Red Planet's surface. "It's
                    been a delight to look at rocks on another planet and see
                    processes that are so familiar," Ives said. Following the
                    curves

                    [...] "What's exciting here is we've entered a new phase of
                    Jezero's history. And it's the first time we're seeing
                    environments like this on Mars," said Perseverance's deputy
                    project scientist, Katie Stack Morgan of JPL. "We're
                    thinking about rivers on a different scale than we have
                    before."

                    has found that in some cases, the tiny number of abnormal
                    mitochondria that are inevitably carried over from the
                    mother's egg to the donor egg can multiply when the baby is
                    in the womb. So-called reversion or reversal could lead to a
                    disease in the child. "The reason why reversal is seen in
                    the cells of some children born following MRT procedures,
                    but not in others, is not fully understood," said Dagan

                    University of Oxford who took part in the research.

                    mutations that cause a fatal condition called Leigh
                    syndrome. Prior to the treatment, performed in Mexico, the
                    woman had four miscarriages and two children. One died aged
                    six, the other lived for only eight months.

                    "So far, the clinical experience with MRT has been
                    encouraging, but the number of reported cases is far too
                    small to draw any definitive conclusions about the safety or
                    efficacy," said Wells. "Long-term follow-up of the children
                    born is essential. The stage of development when reversal
                    happens is unclear, but it probably occurs at a very early
                    stage. This means that prenatal testing, carried out [at]
                    about 12 weeks of pregnancy, may well succeed in identifying
                    if reversal has occurred."

                    "I had given up on all of this," said Kim, who spent years
                    coming up with ways to detect anyons as a graduate student
                    and now collaborates with Google. "Then came the quantum

                    [...] Last fall, Kim and Yuri Lensky, a theorist at Cornell,
                    along with Google researchers, posted a recipe for
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09282">easily making</a>
                    and braiding pairs of defects in the toric code. In a
                    preprint posted shortly after, experimentalists at Google
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10255"

                    that idea, which involved severing connections between
                    neighboring qubits. The resulting flaws in the qubit grid
                    acted just like the simplest species of non-abelian
                    quasiparticle, Microsoft's Majorana zero modes.

                    "My initial reaction was 'Wow, Google just simulated what
                    Microsoft is trying to build. It was a real flexing moment,"

                  <p>
                    By tweaking which connections they cut, the researchers
                    could move the deformations. They made two pairs of
                    non-abelian defects, and by sliding them around a
                    five-by-five-qubit chessboard, they just barely eked out a
                    braid. The researchers declined to comment on their
                    experiment, which is being prepared for publication, but
                    other experts praised the achievement.

                  <p>
                    [...] The technique had a dark side that initially doomed
                    researchers' attempts to make non-abelian phases:
                    Measurement produces random outcomes. When the theorists
                    targeted a particular phase, measurements left non-abelian
                    anyons speckled randomly about, as if the researchers were
                    trying to paint the Mona Lisa by splattering paint onto a
                    canvas. "It seemed like a complete headache," Verresen said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Toward the end of 2021, Vishwanath's group hit on a
                    solution: sculpting the wave function of a qubit grid with
                    multiple rounds of measurement. With the first round, they
                    turned a boring phase of matter into a simple abelian phase.
                    Then they fed that phase forward into a second round of
                    measurements, further chiseling it into a more complicated
                    phase. By playing this game of topological cat's cradle,
                    they realized they could address randomness while moving
                    step by step, climbing a ladder of increasingly complicated
                    phases to reach
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03061"
                      >a phase with non-abelian order</a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Instead of randomly trying measurements and seeing what you
                    get, you want to hop across the landscape of phases of
                    matter," Verresen said. It's a topological landscape that
                    theorists have only recently

                  <p>
                    [...] The DOJ and its global partners identified the Snake
                    malware in hundreds of computer systems in at least 50
                    countries. Prosecutors said the Russian spies behind the
                    Turla group used the malware to target NATO member states —
                    and other targets of the Russian government — as far back as
                    2004.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the United States, the FSB used its sprawling network of
                    Snake-infected computers to target industries including
                    education, small businesses and media organizations, along
                    with critical infrastructure sectors including government
                    facilities, financial services, manufacturing and
                    communications. The FBI said it obtained information
                    indicating that Turla had also used Snake malware to target
                    the personal computer of a journalist at an unnamed U.S.
                    news media company who had reported on the Russian
                    government.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prosecutors added that Snake persists on a compromised
                    computer's system "indefinitely," despite efforts by the
                    victim to neutralize the infection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After stealing sensitive documents, Turla exfiltrated this
                    information through a covert peer-to-peer network of
                    Snake-compromised computers in the U.S. and other countries,
                    the DOJ said, making the network's presence harder to
                    detect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The FBI said it developed a tool called "Perseus" —
                    the Greek hero who slayed monsters — that allowed its agents
                    to identify network traffic that the Snake malware had tried
                    to obfuscate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Between 2016 and 2022, FBI officials identified the IP
                    addresses of eight compromised computers in the U.S.,
                    located in California, Georgia, Connecticut, New York,
                    Oregon, South Carolina and Maryland. (The FBI said it also
                    alerted local authorities to take down Snake infections on
                    compromised machines located outside of the United States.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With the victim's consent, the FBI obtained remote access to
                    some of the compromised machines and monitored each for
                    "years at a time." This allowed the FBI to identify other
                    victims in the Snake network, and to develop capabilities to
                    impersonate the Turla operators and issue commands to the
                    Snake malware as if the FBI agents were the Russian hackers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then this week, after obtaining a search warrant from a
                    federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, the FBI was given the
                    green light to mass-command the network to shut down.

                    YouTube's annoying ads often push those who don't want to
                    pay $120 for YouTube Premium to use ad blockers. But Google
                    isn't happy about this potentially lost revenue, and has
                    decided to experiment with a feature that urges ad-blocker
                    users to think again.

                    a screenshot earlier this week showing a YouTube popup
                    warning that ad blockers are not allowed on the platform. It
                    notes that ads allow YouTube to stay free for billions of
                    users worldwide, and that an ad-free experience is available
                    via the paid-for YouTube Premium. The message finishes with
                    two options: Allow ads on YouTube or try YouTube Premium,
                    which is $11.99 per month or $119.99 per year for access to
                    original programs and no ads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some users who've seen it say they have been able to simply
                    close the pop-up and continue blocking ads on YouTube, but
                    it's likely that Google will clamp down on this, or make the
                    pop-up appear regularly enough to be a distraction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The moderators of the YouTube subreddit wrote that an
                    employee had confirmed the ad-blocker message was an
                    experiment by YouTube. A Google spokesperson expanded on
                    this in a statement to
                    <a
                      href="https://www.ign.com/articles/google-responds-to-reports-of-ad-blockers-being-banned-on-youtube"

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We're running a small experiment globally that urges
                    viewers with ad blockers enabled to allow ads on YouTube or
                    try YouTube Premium," they said. "Ad blocker detection is
                    not new, and other publishers regularly ask viewers to
                    disable ad blockers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While most online companies make their revenue from ads,
                    some complain that YouTube has gone too far, citing its
                    increasing number of unskippable and extended mid-roll ads.

                    It all started in August 2022 with the creation of Rapidus,

                    prototype 2nm-class process node by the end of 2025. Those

                  <p>
                    Rapidus is led by two industry veterans – Tetsuro Higashi
                    (who previously presided over Tokyo Electron) and Atsuyoshi
                    Koike (who previously presided over Western Digital's
                    Japanese arm). It is also backed by a several technology and
                    financial firms such as Kioxia (formerly Toshiba Memory
                    Corp.), Sony, Toyota Motor, Denso, NEC, NTT, Softbank, and
                    Mitsubishi UFJ Bank.

                    [...] Choosing the right location for a chip factory is a
                    difficult task. Chitose has an ample water supply and relies
                    on renewable sources for its energy needs, which make it a
                    good candidate. However, most of the relevant suppliers are
                    clustered in the Kumamoto prefecture, so Rapidus will need
                    to encourage them to have a presence in Hokkaido as well.
                    Notably, this is where TSMC is building a chip plant as part

                  <p>
                    Perhaps the biggest challenge for Rapidus will be to acquire
                    all the necessary EUV lithography equipment from

                    machines for their expansion plans, which is why lead times
                    are now around two years. Luckily for Rapidus, US sanctions

                    astounding claim—and a questionable one, according to
                    several nuclear experts. That's mainly because the company
                    hasn't said and won't comment on whether it's passed the
                    first big test for fusion: getting more energy out of the
                    process than it takes to drive it.

                  <p>
                    [...] Nevertheless, the 10-year-old company, which is based
                    in Everett, Washington, has already lined up its first
                    customer for the planned commercial facility, striking a
                    power purchase agreement with the software giant Microsoft.
                    Helion expects that the plant will be built somewhere in the
                    state of Washington, go online in 2028, and reach its full
                    generating capacity of at least 50 megawatts within a year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Other fusion startups are aiming to begin operating
                    power plants in the early 2030s, and plenty of observers
                    think even those timelines are overly optimistic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unless Helion has made some major advances that most
                    organizations would have trumpeted, the company still faces
                    a series of very difficult technical tasks, says Jessica
                    Lovering, executive director of Good Energy Collective, a
                    policy research group that advocates for the use of nuclear
                    energy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The truth is fusion is hard, and new power plants are
                    hard, and first-of-a-kind anythings are also hard," he says.
                    "It's one reason we're trying to get out in front and trying
                    to solve all those problems today."

                <div>
                  <p>
                    [...] Specifically, Pythagoras identified the root of
                    reality in what he called the <em>tetractys,</em> consisting
                    of the first four integers: 1, 2, 3 and 4. Added together,
                    those numbers equal 10. Ten, Pythagoras concluded, is the
                    "perfect" number, the number that holds the key to
                    understanding nature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And why 1, 2, 3 and 4? Because those numbers were the key to
                    creating harmonious sounds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Pythagoreans surmised that the motions of the
                    heavenly bodies generated pleasant music. As Aristotle later
                    explained it, those bodies move rapidly and therefore they
                    must make sound, because anything moving quickly on Earth
                    makes sound (think arrows whizzing through the air). Proper
                    ratios of the planets' speeds (which depended on their
                    distances from the central fire) guaranteed that the sounds
                    would be harmonious. Hence the moving planets created a
                    "harmony of the heavens." Because later Greek writers
                    supposed that each planet is carried on its orbit by a
                    rotating sphere, eventually that harmony became known as
                    "the music of the spheres."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Using math for understanding nature was unknown before
                    Pythagoras. It was his idea. Previously math had been a tool
                    for scribes or surveyors or cooks. "Pythagoras freed
                    mathematics from these practical applications," the Dutch
                    mathematician B.L. van der Waerden wrote in his
                    <a
                      href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.134.3494.1975.a"
                      >classic history of ancient math</a
                    >. "The Pythagoreans pursued mathematics as a kind of
                    religious contemplation, as a way to approach the eternal
                    Truth."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for the music of the spheres, one issue remained. If the
                    heavens made harmonious sounds, why didn't anybody hear
                    them? Aristotle reported that the Pythagoreans "explain this
                    by saying that the sound is in our ears from the very moment
                    of birth and is thus indistinguishable from its contrary
                    silence."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Aristotle rejected that explanation, just as he rejected the
                    idea of a "counter-Earth" as well as the whole notion that
                    everything was made from numbers. And yet, the importance of
                    numbers in science, first expressed by Pythagoras,
                    ultimately proved to be much more resilient than most of
                    Aristotle's ideas. As experts on early Greek philosophy
                    André Laks and Glenn Most have written, "Of all the early
                    Greek philosophers," Pythagoras "without a doubt exerted the
                    longest-lasting influence until the beginning of modern
                    times."

                    Bird said Pearson had an advantage as its AI products would

                    "They are in a very different business to us," he said. "We

                    (i.e. spaced out and weeded) triggers plants to produce
                    seeds that germinate more easily. This makes the harvests
                    easier to plant successfully the next time around,
                    eliminating a key barrier to further selection.

                  <p>
                    "Our results show that erect knotweed grown in low-density
                    agroecosystems spontaneously 'act domesticated' in a single
                    growing season, before any selection has occurred," Mueller
                    said.

                  <p>
                    Think of it as the plant equivalent to that first wolf who,
                    though still a wild animal, sat down with its human friend
                    around the fire. This is a behavioral shift, rather than an
                    evolutionary one, but it allows new evolutionary pathways to
                    open up.

                    [...] "You can't explain plant domestication if you only
                    consider the behaviors of humans, because domestication is
                    the result of reciprocal relationships between multiple
                    species that are all capable of responding to each other,"
                    Mueller said.

                    The Occamy processor, which uses a chiplet architecture,
                    packs 432 RISC-V and AI accelerators and comes with 32GB of
                    HBM2E memory, has taped out. The chip is backed by the
                    European Space Agency and developed by engineers from ETH
                    Zürich and the University of Bologna, reports
                    <a
                      href="https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/05/08/european-processor-designed-for-use-in-space-taped-out/"
                      >HPC Wire</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ESA-backed Occamy processor uses two chiplets with 216
                    32-bit RISC-V cores, an unknown number of 64-bit FPUs for
                    matrix calculations, and carries two 16GB HBM2E memory
                    packages from Micron. The cores are interconnected using a
                    silicon interposer, and the dual-tile CPU can deliver 0.75
                    FP64 TFLOPS of performance and 6 FP8 TFLOPS of compute
                    capability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Neither ESA nor its development partners have disclosed the
                    Occamy CPUs' power consumption, but it is said that the chip
                    can be passively cooled, meaning it might be a low-power
                    processor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each Occamy chiplet has 216 RISC-V cores and matrix FPUs,
                    totaling around a billion transistors spread over 73mm^2 of
                    silicon. The tiles are made by GlobalFoundries using its
                    14LPP fabrication process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 73mm^2 chiplet isn't a particularly large die. For
                    example, Intel's Alder Lake (with six high-performance
                    cores) has a die size of 163 mm^2. As far as performance is
                    concerned, Nvidia's A30 GPU with 24GB of HBM2 memory
                    delivers 5.2 FP64/10.3 FP64 Tensor TFLOPS as well as 330/660
                    (with sparsity) INT8 TOPS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, one of the advantages of chiplet designs is that
                    ESA and its partners from ETH Zürich and the University of
                    Bologna can add other chiplets to the package to accelerate
                    certain workloads if needed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Occamy CPU is developed as a part of the EuPilot
                    program, and it is one of many chips that the ESA is
                    considering for spaceflight computing. However, there are no
                    guarantees that the process will indeed be used onboard
                    spaceships.

                    The researchers used blood samples from a subset of the
                    patients to look at immune responses and compare them with
                    those from matched vaccinated controls. They first compared
                    antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and found no evidence of
                    "overexuberant" or enhanced antibody responses against the
                    virus that might explain the myocarditis and pericarditis.
                    The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in the two groups
                    were comparable, with the patients with the heart condition
                    having comparable, if not slightly blunted, antibody
                    responses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers next screened for auto-antibodies, that is,
                    antibodies spurred by the vaccine that are misdirected
                    against a person's body rather than the virus. They used an
                    established screening tool to scan for autoantibodies
                    against over 6,000 human proteins and molecules. The
                    researchers focused on over 500 of the probes that relate to
                    cardiac tissue. They found no relative increase in the
                    number of autoantibodies compared with the controls,
                    suggesting that an autoimmune response was unlikely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers then took a broad, unbiased approach to
                    compare the profiles of immune responses among the patients
                    and controls. They found distinct immune signatures between
                    the two groups, with patients showing elevated levels of
                    immune signaling chemicals (cytokines) that are linked to
                    acute, systemic inflammation. And those cytokines were
                    accompanied by corresponding elevations in inflammatory
                    cellular responses, particularly cytotoxic T cells. Further,
                    the gene expression profiles of those T cells showed the
                    potential to cause heart tissue damage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Taken together, the researchers concluded that the most
                    likely explanation is that in these rare cases of
                    myocarditis and pericarditis, the vaccine is spurring a
                    generalized, vigorous inflammatory response that leads to
                    heart tissue inflammation and damage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For now, the finding that an inflammatory response is
                    behind the cases can help guide treatment and prevention. A
                    Canadian study from last year suggested that extending
                    <a
                      href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2793551"
                      >the interval between mRNA vaccine doses</a
                    >
                    can reduce the chances of myocarditis and pericarditis in
                    young males. But, the new study may bring some relief when
                    it does occur—self-resolving inflammation is less concerning
                    than a difficult-to-treat autoimmune response.

                    accused the US of a "troubling" and "classic rush to
                    judgment," claiming that the government didn't even wait to
                    receive "millions of documents" and "other evidence" against
                    Bankman-Fried before "improperly seeking" to turn "civil and
                    regulatory issues into federal crimes."

                    pleaded not guilty. Now, in his motion to dismiss,
                    Bankman-Fried has requested an oral argument to "fight these
                    baseless charges" and "clear his name." He's asking the
                    court to dismiss 10 out of 13 charges, arguing that federal
                    prosecutors have failed to substantiate most of their

                    Australian lawmakers have met United States Ambassador
                    Caroline Kennedy, urging her to help drop the pending
                    extradition case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange
                    and allow him to return to Australia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The "Bring Julian Assange Home Parliamentary Group" said on
                    Tuesday it informed Kennedy of "the widespread concern in
                    Australia" about the continued detention of Assange, an
                    Australian citizen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The meeting comes before US President Joe Biden's scheduled
                    visit to Australia this month for the Quad leaders' summit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There are a range of views about Assange in the Australian
                    community and the members of the Parliamentary Group reflect
                    that diversity of views. But what is not in dispute in the
                    Group is that Mr Assange is being treated unjustly," the
                    legislators said in a statement after meeting Kennedy in the
                    capital, Canberra.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Assange is battling extradition from the United Kingdom to
                    the US where he is wanted on criminal charges over the
                    release of confidential military records and diplomatic
                    cables in 2010. Washington says the release of the documents
                    had put lives in danger.

                    "AI on real-world clinical records has the potential to
                    produce a scalable workflow for early detection of cancer in
                    the community, to shift focus from treatment of late-stage
                    to early-stage cancer, to improve the quality of life of
                    patients and to increase the benefit/cost ratio of cancer
                    care," the paper reads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Effective prediction in real-world settings will rely on the
                    quality of patients' medical histories. Future AI-based
                    screening tools for pancreatic cancer will have to be
                    trained on specific local population data, the study found.
                    A model trained on data from Danish patients, for example,
                    was not as accurate when applied to US patients.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Given the experience in Denmark and one or two US health
                    systems, this means that in each country with different
                    conditions and different systems, it is best to re-train the
                    model locally. AI needs a lot of data to train. Access in
                    different locations is not straightforward, as medical
                    records are and should be confidential. So local approval
                    and data security is essential," Sander said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study is still in its early stages, and the software
                    cannot yet be used to run screening programs. Improvements
                    are needed before even a trial can be conducted.

                    Royal is notable for bucking the trend towards using a
                    ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model as Conti did — i.e.,
                    rather than partnering with affiliates to carry out the
                    attacks in exchange for a profit share, Royal operates as a
                    private group, doing its own dirty work.

                  <p>
                    That said, the use of BatLoader might indicate that Royal
                    might be forging partnerships to achieve initial access at
                    targeted organizations.

                    to ultimately deliver a range of end-stage malware, not just

                    A heavier, cheaper battery might be preferable in some
                    circumstances, like for the smaller, lower-range EVs common
                    in China. JAC's announced range is comparable to that of the

                    A somewhat easier market for sodium-ion batteries might be
                    stationary storage installations, like those used to provide
                    backup power for a home or business or on the electrical
                    grid. Some companies, like US-based
                    <a href="https://natron.energy/">Natron</a>, are developing
                    the chemistry specifically for stationary applications,
                    where size and weight aren't as critical as they are in a
                    moving car.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But if market conditions have opened the door for
                    lithium alternatives, they could just as easily slam it
                    shut. The fate of sodium-ion batteries will likely be
                    "directly tied to the cost of lithium," says Jay Whitacre, a
                    battery researcher at Carnegie Mellon University and
                    previous founder of a sodium-ion battery company called
                    Aquion.

                  <p>
                    [...] Sodium could end up in EV batteries in China as early
                    as the end of this year, but the technology probably won't
                    overthrow lithium. Rather, the world of batteries will
                    likely continue to branch out and diversify, with companies
                    developing more battery options for different situations.
                    There are "nooks and crannies" in the battery market, as
                    Whitacre puts it, and soon, sodium-ion might finally find
                    its place.

                    of its parent body, researchers report in the April
                    <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets</em>. And the
                    concern isn't theoretical: a subset of the oldest known
                    Martian meteorites appear to have already had their magnetic
                    memories wiped, the team showed.

                    [...] Planetary scientist Foteini Vervelidou uses meteorites
                    from Mars — chunks of the planet that were blasted into
                    space by an impact and later captured by Earth's gravity —
                    to study its ancient past. Just
                    <a href="https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/">a few hundred</a>
                    are known to exist. Rarer still are specimens that contain
                    minerals carrying imprints of
                    <a
                      href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sad-magnetic-state-solar-systems-rocky-worlds"
                      >the Red Planet's magnetic field, which collapsed</a
                    >
                    about 3.7 billion years ago (<em>SN: 9/7/15</em>). The
                    oldest known Martian meteorites, which date to roughly 4.4
                    billion years ago, therefore present an "amazing chance to
                    study the magnetic field," says Vervelidou, of MIT and the
                    Institute of Earth Physics of Paris.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But such opportunities can be readily squandered, Vervelidou
                    and colleagues have shown. The team's numerical calculations
                    and experiments with earthly rocks — stand-ins for
                    meteorites — confirmed that bringing a hand magnet close to
                    a rock can rearrange the spins of the rock's electrons. That
                    rearrangement overwrites the imprint of a previous magnetic
                    field, a process called remagnetization.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It is possible to evaluate a meteorite without
                    destroying its magnetic properties. Vervelidou uses a lab
                    instrument called a susceptibility meter, which measures how
                    an object would respond to a magnetic field. And portable
                    versions exist: She and a team of meteorite researchers used
                    one to find nearly 1,000 meteorites on a recent expedition
                    in Chile. Hopefully, Vervelidou says, some of those space
                    rocks will shed light on Mars' magnetic past.

                    As more young people risk hearing loss, over-the-counter
                    hearing aids are providing new options, but also confusing
                    choices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ayla Wing's middle school students don't always know what to
                    make of their 26-year-old teacher's hearing aids. The most
                    common response she hears: "Oh, my grandma has them, too."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But grandma's hearing aids were never like this:
                    Bluetooth-enabled and connected to her phone, they allow Ms.
                    Wing to toggle with one touch between custom settings. She
                    can shut out the world during a screeching subway ride, hear
                    her friends in noisy bars during a night out and even
                    understand her students better by switching to "mumbly
                    kids."

                    A raft of new hearing aids have hit the market in recent
                    years, offering greater appeal to a generation of young
                    adults that some experts say is both

                    and — perhaps paradoxically — becoming more comfortable with
                    an expensive piece of technology pumping sound into their
                    ears.

                    Some of the new models, including Ms. Wing's, are made by
                    traditional prescription brands, which usually require a
                    visit to a specialist. But the Food and Drug Administration
                    opened up the market last year when it allowed the sale of
                    hearing aids over the counter. In response, brand names like
                    Sony and Jabra began releasing their own products, adding to
                    the new wave of designs and features that appeal to young
                    consumers.

                    "These new hearing aids are sexy," said Pete Bilzerian, a
                    25-year-old in Richmond, Va., who has worn the devices since
                    he was 7. He describes his early models as distinctly
                    unsexy: "big, funky, tan-colored hearing aids with the
                    molding that goes all around the ear." But increasingly,
                    those have given way to sleeker, smaller models with more
                    technological capabilities.

                  <p>
                    Nowadays, he said, no one seems to notice the electronics in
                    his ear. "If it ever does come up as a topic, I just brush
                    it off and say, 'Hey, I got these very expensive AirPods.'"

                    Gallup has tracked several swings in public opinion since
                    first asking about nuclear in 1994. From 2004 to 2015, a
                    majority of Americans favored nuclear power use, with a high
                    of 62 percent in support in 2010. But in 2016, the survey
                    found a majority opposition to nuclear power for the first
                    time. Gallup speculated that lower gasoline prices that year
                    may have "lessened Americans' perceptions that energy
                    sources such as nuclear power are needed." In recent years,
                    views on nuclear power had been evenly divided until the
                    latest poll, conducted between March 1 and 23.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new poll found that 62 percent of Republicans support
                    the use of nuclear power, compared to 46 percent of
                    Democrats. The support from Republicans is likely driven by
                    "a focus on energy independence, supporting innovation,
                    supporting American leadership globally, and supporting
                    American competition with folks like China and Russia
                    specifically in terms of the nuclear space," said Ryan
                    Norman, senior policy advisor at the center-left think tank
                    Third Way.

                    [...] In addition to the Department of Energy's modeling,
                    the International Energy Agency's Net Zero by 2050 scenario
                    found that in order to fully decarbonize the global economy,
                    worldwide nuclear power capacity would need to double
                    between 2022 and 2050.

                    In Congress, nuclear power has enjoyed some rare moments of
                    bipartisan support. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle
                    have joined forces to pass a few successful pro-nuclear
                    laws. The 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law injected $6
                    billion toward maintaining existing nuclear power plants.
                    And while the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act was an entirely
                    Democratic effort, it included a technology-neutral tax
                    credit for low-carbon energy that can be used for nuclear
                    power plants. The climate spending law also allocates
                    millions in investments for advanced nuclear research and
                    demonstration.

                    "Remarkably, the cognitive scores increased to levels
                    similar to undergraduates taking the same cognitive tests
                    for the first time," Wu said. "Our finding of continuous
                    cognitive growth in older adulthood is unique because most
                    studies show only maintenance of cognitive abilities or
                    cognitive decline over time."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The key to the difference, Wu surmises, is learning multiple
                    tasks simultaneously in an encouraging environment, similar
                    to what children experience.

                    [...] For Wu, it is further affirmation of her past
                    research, which demonstrated that older adults can learn by
                    emulating the learning behaviors of children. Among other
                    things, it means older adults must approach learning with an
                    open mind, unafraid of criticism and failure, receptive to
                    instruction, willing to learn multiple tasks at once, and
                    with a belief they can improve with effort.

                    the entire internet.

                    [...] Stopping pings does block this group from doing
                    geolocation. However, I want ping enabled for my honeypots.
                    For those systems, I came up with another creative solution:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>

                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    (You might need to install niceshaper: sudo apt install
                    niceshaper.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The "tc" program does traffic control. Usually
                    administrators use it to throttle the throughput so that one
                    host doesn't dominate all of the building's bandwidth.
                    However on my honeypot, I just added in a random delay of
                    100 +/- 50ms. Suddenly those measured delays and computed
                    distances are unreliable. Things that should be 1,800 miles
                    away can now appear to be over 100,000 miles away. (That
                    computed example of 69,000 miles was due to this random
                    delay.) This doesn't stop them from pinging my server, but
                    it does poison their geolocation computations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I haven't yet figured out how to only add delays to ICMP and
                    ICMPv6 echo-request packets. But this solution is definitely
                    good enough for now. Nothing stops them from slinging their
                    echo-request packets all over the internet. However, my
                    production servers don't respond and my honeypots mess them
                    up.

                    "The reaction cycle in Photosystem II involves four main
                    steps, each triggered by the absorption of one photon. In
                    each of the steps at the site of action in Photosystem II, a
                    group of four Mn atoms and one Ca atom acts like a battery
                    that gets more and more charged with each step," they told
                    us. After four photons have been absorbed, Photosystem II
                    strips protons from water molecules and brings them close
                    enough that a new chemical bond is forged between the oxygen

                      >accidentally leaked to ChatGPT</a
                    >, Samsung is cracking down on usage of the generative AI
                    service. The electronics giant is planning a temporary block
                    of the use of generative AI tools on company-owned devices,
                    covering computers, tablets, phones, as well as
                    non-company-owned devices running on internal networks. The
                    ban would cover not just ChatGPT, but services that use the
                    technology like Microsoft's Bing, as well as competing
                    generative AI services like Bard from Google.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to a memo from Monday seen by Bloomberg, the
                    restriction would be temporary, lasting until it builds
                    "security measures to create a secure environment for safely
                    using generative AI to enhance employees' productivity and
                    efficiency." The South Korea-headquartered tech firm is said
                    to be developing its own in-house AI tools for "software
                    development and translation," according to the report.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The tech giant initially allowed employees at its
                    device solutions (DS) division, which manages its
                    semiconductor and display businesses, to use generative AI
                    from March 11. In the aftermath of the data leak, Samsung
                    also asked staff using generative AI tools elsewhere "not to
                    submit any company-related information or personal data,"
                    which could disclose its intellectual property, by the memo
                    reviewed by Bloomberg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the issues that Samsung noted that it is difficult to
                    "retrieve and delete" the data on external servers, and the
                    data transmitted to such AI tools could be disclosed to
                    other users. Based on Samsung's internal survey in April,
                    about 65% of participants said using generative AI tools
                    carries a security risk.

                    Ransomware attacks against companies and government agencies
                    are on the rise despite efforts by cybersecurity experts to
                    prevent such incidences. Since the start of the pandemic,
                    hundreds of U.S. businesses have reported being ransomware
                    victims, with the largest known attack being the Kaseya hack
                    in 2021.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More recently, the U.S. government has also faced a string
                    of cybersecurity incidents, with the FBI, the Department of
                    Defense, and the United States Marshals Service (USMS) all
                    confirming multiple data leaks and targeted attacks this
                    year. Just last week, the USMS

                      href="https://www.techspot.com/news/97764-us-marshals-service-latest-string-cybersecurity-incidents-over.html"

                    that cybercriminals had targeted its systems with a
                    ransomware attack, exposing a large amount of data,
                    including personally identifiable information (PII) of
                    employees. Thankfully, the incident did not expose the
                    witness protection program database, meaning no witnesses
                    are in danger.
                  </p>

                    [...] According to

                      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/05/01/marshals-hack-fugitives-surveillance-shutdown/"
                      >The Washington Post</a
                    >, the system has remained down for so long because the USMS
                    decided not to pay any ransom to unlock the network.
                    Instead, officials moved to shut down the entire system,
                    which included remotely wiping the cellphones of all
                    employees who worked in the department. The sudden move,
                    which was implemented without any prior warning, cleared out
                    all their files, contacts and emails, inconveniencing many.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, despite the apparent roadblock, the USMS remains
                    adamant that the shutdown isn't affecting its ability to
                    conduct investigations. In a statement this week, Marshals
                    spokesperson Drew Wade said that most of the critical
                    investigative tools have already been restored, and the
                    agency is planning to soon deploy "a fully reconstituted
                    system with improved IT security countermeasures" for the
                    future.

                    [...] Nanoplastics are defined as having a size of less than
                    0.001 millimetres, while at 0.001 to 5 millimetres, some
                    microplastics are still visible to the naked eye. MNPs enter
                    the food chain through various sources including packaging
                    waste. But it is not just solid food that plays a role, but
                    liquids too: according to one study, anyone who drinks the
                    recommended 1.5-2 litres of water per day from plastic
                    bottles will end up ingesting around 90,000 plastic
                    particles a year in the process. However, drinking tap water
                    instead can – depending on the geographical location – help
                    reduce this figure to 40,000. "To minimise the potential
                    harm of micro- and nanoplastic particles to humans and the
                    environment, it is crucial to limit exposure and restrict
                    their use while further research is carried out into the
                    effects of MNPs," Lukas Kenner explained. The newly
                    discovered mechanism by which MNPs breach protective
                    barriers in the body has the potential to advance research
                    in this area decisively.

                    Although the 15 billion gallons of ethanol mixed into
                    gasoline each year falls well short of the 36 billion that
                    President Bush hoped for, the number of refineries in the
                    U.S. has nearly doubled to almost 200 since his presidency.
                    Between 2008 and 2016, corn cultivation increased by about 9
                    percent. In some areas, like the Dakotas and western
                    Minnesota, it rose as much as 100 percent during that time.
                    Nationwide, corn land expanded by more than 11 million acres
                    between 2005 and 2021.

                    "A quarter of all the corn land in the U.S. is used for
                    ethanol. It's a land area equivalent to all the corn land in
                    Minnesota and Iowa combined," said Hill. "That has
                    implications. It's not just what happens in the U.S. It's
                    what happens globally."

                    Samsung's Sf3 (3nm-class) fabrication technology (set to be
                    introduced at the T1-2 session) will use the company's
                    second-gen Multi-Bridge-Channel field-effect transistors
                    (MBCFET). This new fabrication technology builds upon the
                    first-gen GAA device (SF3E) that's already in mass
                    production, incorporating further optimization.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Samsung claims that compared to SF4 (4LPP, 4nm-class, low
                    power plus), SF3 offers a 22% higher performance at the same
                    power and transistor count, a 34% power reduction at the
                    same clocks and complexity, and a 0.79x logic area
                    reduction. However, Samsung doesn't compare its SF3 to SF3E,
                    and there is no word about the SRAM and analog circuit
                    scaling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the main benefits of GAA transistors over FinFET
                    devices is the reduced leakage current since their gate is
                    surrounded by the channel on all four sides. Additionally,
                    the channel thickness can be adjusted to enhance performance
                    or reduce power consumption.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Samsung now says that the SF3 platform offers greater design
                    flexibility enabled by various nanosheet (NS) widths of the
                    MBCFET device within the same cell type. It is unclear
                    whether it means that the original SF3E lacks one of the key
                    capabilities of GAA transistors, but Samsung's phrasing at
                    least implies it.

                    in its paper depicts damage on top of the nanosheet during
                    the metal gate process, so we may speculate that one of the
                    aspects that the company will cover are production
                    challenges it encountered with its GAA-based SF3E production
                    node.

                  <p>
                    Interestingly, recently the company admitted that its
                    fabrication processes are behind those of TSMC, and it will
                    take at least five years to catch up.

                    Ms Ip - who doesn't drink - only had a bottle of wine in the
                    car as she was planning to give it as a present.

                    After five nights stranded, she was discovered by emergency
                    services on Friday as they flew overhead as part of a
                    search.

                    the policewoman had a cigarette."

                    her was a bottle of wine she had bought as a gift for her
                    mother so that got her through," Wodonga Police Station
                    Sergeant Martin Torpey said.

                  <p>
                    "She used great common sense to stay with her car and not
                    wander off into bushland, which assisted in police being
                    able to find her."

                    It could be a crucial question posed by the expected growth
                    in space tourism over the next decade – namely what would a
                    human conception in space mean for the sector?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's the situation posed by an international group of
                    scientists, clinicians and other interested parties, who
                    have authored a consultative green paper led by
                    <a

                  <p>
                    It highlights that the emerging space tourism sector has not
                    openly considered or discussed the risks of sex in space or
                    prepared suitable mitigation approaches. It argues it is
                    unrealistic to assume all future space tourists will abstain
                    from sexual activities – opening the possibility of human
                    conception and the early stages of human reproduction
                    occurring in space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This appears to pose several risks, those of a biological
                    nature such as embryo developmental risks and those of a
                    commercial nature such as liability, litigation, and
                    reputational damage. The authors recommend that an open
                    discussion is now needed within the space tourism industry
                    to consider the risks.

                    impacts of which we need to take seriously."

                    The software, NeMo Guardrails, is supposed to ensure that
                    smart applications, such as AI chatbots, powered by large
                    language models (LLMs) are "accurate, appropriate, on topic
                    and secure," according to Nvidia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The open-source software can be used by AI developers can
                    utilize to set up three types of boundaries for AI models:
                    Topical, safety, and security guardrails.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The safety guardrails are an attempt to tackle the
                    issue of misinformation and hallucinations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When employed, it will ensure that AI applications respond
                    with accurate and appropriate information. For example, by
                    using the software, bans on inappropriate language and
                    credible source citations can be reinforced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Nvidia claims that virtually all software developers
                    will be able to use NeMo Guardrails since they are simple to
                    use, work with a broad range of LLM-enabled applications,
                    and work with all the tools that enterprise app developers
                    use such as LangChain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company will be incorporating NeMo Guardrails into its
                    Nvidia NeMo framework, which is already mostly available as
                    an open-source code on GitHub.

                    5G networks are continuing to deliver better and faster
                    service than 4G in general. Compared to 5G service from a

                    have generally declined around the world, according to

                    Part of the problem is the same problem had by every
                    cellular generation. There are the normal growing pains as
                    more customers buy new phones and other devices that can tap
                    into these networks. [...]

                    [...] Outside of cities, different problems are taking root.
                    A big selling-point for 5G is the ability to tap into new
                    bands of spectrum, most notably the

                  <p>
                    Millimeter wave has also seen barely any uptake outside of a
                    handful of countries, including the United States, and even
                    there it's been limited. Companies like Verizon—initially
                    bullish on millimeter wave—have instead pivoted to other
                    newly-available bands, most notably the C-band (4 to 8 GHz).

                    [...] It's too early to say whether or how 6G development
                    will be impacted by 5G's early stumbles, but there are a
                    handful of possible impacts. It's conceivable, for example,
                    given the lackluster debut of millimeter wave, that the
                    industry devotes less time in terahertz wave research and
                    instead considers how cellular and Wi-Fi technologies could
                    be merged in areas requiring dense coverage.

                    Data science technologies available to today's researchers
                    play a key role in shaping our understanding of the solar
                    system. It not only uncovers new findings from the latest
                    data, it also allows researchers to glean new information
                    from previously collected data. Thanks to this tech,
                    researchers reviewing decades-old data from NASA's Voyager 2
                    probe have uncovered exciting secrets locked below the
                    surface of Uranus' moons.

                    spacecraft was launched in 1977 to study our solar system's
                    outer planets and beyond. In 1986, the probe became the
                    first of its kind to visit Uranus, returning never before
                    seen images and data about the ice giant during its
                    five-and-a-half-hour fly-by on the way to Neptune. During
                    the trip, the probe discovered and provided data about 10
                    new moons orbiting the planet, two new rings (in addition to
                    nine previously known rings), and information about Uranus'
                    tilted, off-axis magnetic field.

                    Despite the data being more than 37 years old, researchers
                    analyzing it using modern modeling techniques have made
                    significant discoveries on four of Uranus' largest moons.

                    cores and the icy surface that covers them.

                    The study incorporated the original data gathered during
                    Voyager 2's fly-bys with more recent data from ground-based
                    stations and other NASA spacecraft, including Galileo,
                    Cassini, Dawn, and New Horizons. The augmented Voyager 2
                    data models allowed researchers to determine that the moons
                    may generate enough internal heat to maintain a liquid
                    ocean, possibly even some with habitable temperatures.

                    anything stopping people from taking over a particularly
                    popular creator's distinctive name? Should Discord prevent
                    this by holding usernames for well-known creators, even if
                    they're not first in line? This is a problem for a lot of
                    social networks, but unlike with some fledgling service
                    attracting new users, all these people are already on
                    Discord — in some cases, they're probably even paid
                    subscribers.

                    In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, Discord said it would
                    be trying to navigate the change gracefully for its
                    best-known users. "We created processes for high-visibility
                    users to secure usernames that will allow them to operate on
                    our platform with minimal risk of impersonation," said
                    Kellyn Slone, director of product communications. "Users
                    with a standing business relationship with Discord who
                    manage certain partner, verified, or creator servers will be
                    able to pick a username before other users in order to
                    reduce the risk of impersonation for their accounts."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A lot of Discord users will fall outside those boundaries.
                    "As a content creator who has a relatively large fanbase —
                    my handle is subject to username sniping by someone with an
                    older account than me," artist
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/zestylemonss">ZestyLemons</a>,
                    who uses Discord to connect with fans, writes to
                    <em>The Verge</em>. "I am not a Discord partner, nor am I
                    famous enough to obtain their recognition, so I will
                    absolutely not have security with my public handle."
                    ZestyLemons noted that for people who <em>do</em> get
                    desirable names, there's the risk of being

                    to give it up — something that's happened on Instagram and
                    Twitter.

                  <p>
                    Discord users understand right now that there are a lot of
                    accounts with very similar names, distinguished only by
                    random numbers at the end. But absolute names change that
                    understanding. They encourage people to look for believable
                    usernames — if somebody nabs the one and only @verge (our
                    Twitter handle) on Discord, people could be more inclined to
                    believe it's us.

                    "It's a bummer that Discord's giving in to the usual social
                    media norms."

                    [...] Despite fears about individual users impersonating
                    each other, the risks for server moderation are less clear —
                    and some Discord server admins told <em>The Verge</em> they
                    weren't worried. "I don't think the change will be a big
                    deal for admins + mods," says Emily, an admin for a large
                    <em>Pokémon Go</em> meet group on Discord. The server
                    already asks people to set server-specific nicknames that
                    match their <em>Pokémon Go</em> trainer name, so they're not
                    relying on discriminators to tell people apart.

                    >
                    who also runs a small Discord server, agrees. "The current
                    username and discriminator system worked perfectly fine, and
                    allowed for thousands of people to have the same name on the
                    platform overall," SupaIsaiah016 writes to
                    <em>The Verge</em>. "Sites that use handles and display
                    names such as Twitter have very different reasons as to why
                    they use those systems, as they are public social medias."

                On the bright side, geothermal power resource potential in the

                geothermal power generation nearly 26-fold by 2050—reaching 60

                    It's easy to build your own desktop PC but, if you want a
                    phone, you usually have to settle for a sealed box that's
                    made by one of a handful of large corporations. Maker Evan
                    Robison wants to change all that as he posted instructions
                    for an open-source,
                    <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/topics/raspberry-pi"

                    with the acronym OURS standing for Open-source, Upgradable,
                    Repairable Smartphone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Robinson, the idea was to create a smartphone
                    alternative for people looking to control their privacy. He
                    also wanted to make a smartphone that could be easily
                    modified and repaired, so an open-source solution was the
                    perfect fit. The OURphone project has quite a few specs that
                    you'll find on many smartphones including 4G LTE internet
                    support, GPS support, Bluetooth and WiFi capability, as well
                    as basic phone operations like the ability to call, text and
                    save contacts in an address book.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, instead of running on Android or iOS, the phone
                    uses Raspberry Pi OS, the Linux-based native operating
                    system for Raspberry Pis. This means that you have very fine
                    control over what software you run on it, but the UI (as
                    pictured) is not particularly touch or phone friendly. You
                    can find all of the code used in the project (as well as
                    detailed instructions) at
                    <a href="https://github.com/evanman83/OURS-project"
                      >GitHub</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In his build guide, Robinson is using a Raspberry Pi 3 B+
                    but there's no reason you couldn't upgrade it to a Pi 4.
                    It's accompanied by a 4G HAT with GSM and GPS antennas. It
                    has a Waveshare touchscreen for video output and user input.
                    A camera can be attached but it isn't necessary for the
                    build. A pair of headphones with a built-in microphone is
                    used for call support. To keep the unit mobile, it operates
                    off of a couple of 18650 batteries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The housing, [m]ade out of 3mm MDF board, is a bit bulky but
                    necessary to contain all of the hardware. It's laser cut
                    with port access made available all around the edges.

                    to be had. Bubble problems make sense in any dimension, and
                    Sullivan found that as long as the number of volumes you're
                    trying to enclose is at most one greater than the dimension,
                    there's a particular way to enclose the volumes that is, in
                    a certain sense, more beautiful than any other—a sort of
                    shadow of a perfectly symmetric bubble cluster on a sphere.
                    This shadow cluster, he conjectured, should be the one that
                    minimizes surface area.

                    Over the decade that followed, mathematicians wrote a series
                    of groundbreaking papers proving Sullivan's conjecture when
                    you're trying to enclose only two volumes. Here, the
                    solution is the familiar double bubble you may have blown in

                    Now, mathematicians have been spared that long wait—and have
                    gotten far more than just a solution to the triple bubble
                    problem. In a
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09102">paper</a> posted
                    online in May 2022, Milman and
                    <a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/jneeman/"
                      >Joe Neeman</a
                    >, of the University of Texas, Austin, have proved
                    Sullivan's conjecture for triple bubbles in dimensions three
                    and up and quadruple bubbles in dimensions four and up, with
                    a follow-up paper on quintuple bubbles in dimensions five
                    and up in the works.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And when it comes to six or more bubbles, Milman and Neeman
                    have shown that the best cluster must have many of the key
                    attributes of Sullivan's candidate, potentially starting
                    mathematicians on the road to proving the conjecture for
                    these cases too. "My impression is that they have grasped
                    the essential structure behind the Sullivan conjecture,"
                    said

                    Milman and Neeman's central theorem is "monumental," Morgan
                    wrote in an email. "It's a brilliant accomplishment with
                    lots of new ideas."

                    A paradigm-shifting study published today in
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01307-6"
                      >Nature Neuroscience</a

                    shows that, just like humans, monkeys are capable of complex
                    deliberation and careful decision-making. The study is first
                    to show that monkeys can think deeply about a problem and
                    consider combinations of factors such as costs, consequences
                    and constraints. In doing so, monkeys find optimal outcomes
                    rather than impulsively reaching for the first available
                    option.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Humans are not the only animals capable of slow and
                    thoughtful deliberation," said senior author William
                    Stauffer, Ph.D., assistant professor of neurobiology at the
                    <a href="https://www.medschool.pitt.edu/"
                      >University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine</a
                    >. "Our work shows that monkeys have a rich mental state
                    that renders them capable of intelligent thinking. It's a
                    new paradigm for studying the neurophysiological basis for
                    deliberative thought."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Several decades ago, Nobel Prize laureate Daniel
                    Kahneman, Ph.D., revolutionized the field of behavioral
                    economics with Prospect Theory. In his book, "Thinking Fast
                    and Slow," he postulated that humans employ two distinct
                    systems of thinking — one nearly instantaneous that happens
                    automatically, and the other much slower, conscious, logical
                    reasoning that requires more mental effort.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kahneman dubbed the first, effortless, type of thinking as
                    'fast' and the second as 'slow.' Slow, effortful thinking
                    enables us to write music, develop scientific hypothesis and
                    balance our checkbooks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As it turns out, the slow thinking of humans is not unique.
