                    New houses that rely on dwindling groundwater supplies
                    around one of the United States' biggest cities are to be
                    banned, officials said Thursday, in a sign of the strains
                    that drought and climate change are causing across the US
                    west.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Water managers in Arizona say there is a significant
                    shortfall in the Phoenix area, and that any more development
                    in the fast-growing city must rely on other sources of
                    water—such as under-strain rivers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Over a period of 100 years, the Phoenix (area) will
                    experience 4.86 million acre-feet of unmet demand for
                    groundwater supplies," the Arizona Department of Water
                    Resources said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An acre-foot is the amount of water it takes to cover an
                    acre with a foot of water—around 326,000 gallons (1.23
                    million liters)—and is equivalent to around half an
                    Olympic-size swimming pool.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The term 'unmet demand' refers to the amount of groundwater
                    usage that is simulated to remain unfulfilled as a result of
                    wells running dry."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The western United States is in the grip of a more-than two-
                    decade drought and a long-term aridification, which
                    scientists say is being exacerbated by human-caused climate
                    change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Major rivers that cross the region, among them the Colorado
                    River, have long been over-exploited, with far more water
                    removed every year than falls as rain or snow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This has led to shrinking reservoirs, including the enormous
                    Lake Mead, which last year dropped to just a quarter of its
                    capacity, threatening "deadpool"—the point where the river
                    downstream dries up and hydroelectric power production
                    ceases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With rivers under pressure, fast-growing population centers
                    have long tapped groundwater to provide water for homes and
                    agriculture, in the form of wells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But this source is easily over-exploited and can in some
                    cases take thousands of years to be replenished.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    State officials said permits already issued for developments
                    in Maricopa County, in which Phoenix sits, will not be
                    rescinded, but developers will have to prove any new
                    applications have a sustainable water source other than
                    groundwater.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Scientists say a wet winter in the US West has
                    alleviated some pressure on the system, but this is only a
                    temporary reprieve as human-caused climate change continues
                    to exacerbate a long-term drying trend.

                    A US Air Force colonel "mis-spoke" when describing an
                    experiment in which an AI-enabled drone opted to attack its
                    operator in order to complete its mission, the service has
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Colonel Tucker Hamilton, chief of AI test and operations in
                    the US Air Force, was speaking at a conference organised by
                    the Royal Aeronautical Society.
                  </p>
                  <p>A report about it went viral.</p>
                  <p>The Air Force says no such experiment took place.</p>
                  <p>
                    In his talk, he had described a virtual scenario in which an
                    AI-enabled drone was repeatedly stopped from completing its
                    task of destroying Surface-to-Air Missile sites by its human
                    operator.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said that in the end, despite having been trained not to
                    kill the operator, the drone destroyed the communication
                    tower so that the operator could no longer communicate with
                    it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We've never run that experiment, nor would we need to in
                    order to realise that this is a plausible outcome," Col
                    Hamilton later clarified in a statement to the Royal
                    Aeronautical Society.

                    [...] During the industry's early years, every self-driving
                    vehicle had a safety driver behind the wheel. If a car
                    encountered a situation it wasn't sure it could negotiate
                    safely, it would signal to the driver to take over.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once cars went fully driverless, this was no longer an
                    option. Instead, when a Waymo or Cruise vehicle encounters a
                    situation it isn't sure how to handle, it will slow down and
                    stop. Sometimes, the situation will resolve itself and the
                    car can move again on its own. Otherwise, the vehicle phones
                    home and asks for remote guidance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As their technology has matured, Waymo and Cruise have
                    both gradually pushed their services into denser and more
                    chaotic areas. Waymo now serves downtown Phoenix. And as
                    we've seen, it serves Sky Train stations near the airport,
                    if not the airport itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While Waymo and Cruise have steadily improved their
                    technology, the commercial rollout of that tech has been

                      >excruciatingly slow</a
                    >. Now both Waymo and Cruise are coming under pressure to
                    expand more rapidly.

                  <p>
                    The reason: Projects like Waymo and Cruise are fantastically

                    [...] So far, the strategy of avoiding freeways, downtowns,
                    and airports has made Waymo and Cruise safe but
                    unprofitable. Eventually, I expect their software will
                    improve enough that they can operate in these challenging
                    environments safely and confidently. But there's no
                    guarantee this will happen within the next year or two. So
                    the leaders of these companies may come under pressure to
                    push into these more challenging environments before they're
                    ready.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I expect some readers have found this article
                    frustrating because I have barely mentioned Tesla's Full
                    Self Driving software, which Tesla fans view as the industry
                    leader. This is because I view Tesla as operating in a
                    different market from Waymo and Cruise. Tesla is building a
                    driver-assistance system that is designed to be used only
                    with direct human oversight, while Waymo and Cruise are
                    trying to build cars that can drive entirely on their own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I think a big reason Tesla fans have a misperception
                    that FSD is ahead of Waymo and Cruise is that Tesla's FSD
                    operates in more situations, including freeways. But that
                    misunderstands what's going on. Waymo has been testing its
                    technology on freeways for more than a decade; it has just
                    been doing it exclusively with safety drivers. Tesla
                    <em>only</em> tests its vehicles with a driver behind the
                    wheel, so of course FSD is able to go on the freeway, too.
                    But this isn't evidence of Tesla's superior performance on
                    freeways; it just reflects Waymo's more cautious approach
                    and different business model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Tesla also isn't laying the necessary groundwork to
                    operate a driverless taxi service. Taxi companies need to
                    develop relationships with taxi regulators, police and
                    firefighters, and other officials in cities where they
                    operate. They also need teams of drivers and mechanics in
                    each city to respond when a driverless taxi gets stranded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As far as I can tell, Tesla hasn't started doing any of
                    this. And that suggests to me that the company isn't serious
                    about entering the driverless taxi business. Rather, Tesla
                    is building a driver-assistance system similar to (if
                    perhaps more advanced than) those offered by other
                    automakers. There's nothing wrong with that. But it means
                    that Tesla isn't a direct competitor to Waymo and Cruise.

                    Platforms remove graphic videos, often using artificial
                    intelligence - but footage that may help prosecutions can be
                    taken down without being archived. Meta and YouTube say they
                    aim to balance their duties to bear witness and protect
                    users from harmful content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Alan Rusbridger, who sits on Meta's Oversight Board,
                    says the industry has been "overcautious" in its moderation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The platforms say they do have exemptions for graphic
                    material when it is in the public interest - but when the
                    BBC attempted to upload footage documenting attacks on
                    civilians in Ukraine, it was swiftly deleted. Artificial
                    intelligence (AI) can remove harmful and illegal content at
                    scale. When it comes to moderating violent images from wars,
                    however, machines lack the nuance to identify human rights
                    violations.

                    Human rights groups say there is an urgent need for social
                    media companies to prevent this information from vanishing.
                    "You can see why they have developed and train their
                    machines to, the moment they see something that looks
                    difficult or traumatic, to take it down," Mr Rusbridger told
                    the BBC. The Meta Oversight Board that he sits on was set up
                    by Mark Zuckerberg and is known as a kind of independent
                    "supreme court" for the company, which owns Facebook and
                    Instagram.

                    "I think the next question for them is how do we develop the
                    machinery, whether that's human or AI, to then make more
                    reasonable decisions," Mr Rusbridger, a former
                    editor-in-chief of the Guardian, adds.

                    [...] Human rights campaigners say there is an urgent need
                    for a formal system to gather and safely store deleted
                    content. This would include preserving metadata to help
                    verify the content and prove it hasn't been tampered with.

                    Ms Van Schaak, the US Ambassador for Global Criminal

                    information can be preserved for potential future
                    accountability exercises. Social media platforms should be
                    willing to make arrangements with accountability mechanisms

                    over the past several years, including some focused on the
                    datacenter, such as those announced by Ventana at the end of
                    last year.

                    software, providing end users with applications that are
                    reliable and commercial-ready, Huffman said.

                    Hiding malicious programs in a computer's UEFI firmware, the
                    deep-seated code that tells a PC how to load its operating
                    system, has become an insidious trick in the toolkit of
                    stealthy hackers. But when a motherboard manufacturer
                    installs its own hidden backdoor in the firmware of millions
                    of computers—and doesn't even put a proper lock on that
                    hidden back entrance—they're practically doing hackers' work
                    for them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at firmware-focused cybersecurity company
                    Eclypsium revealed today that they've discovered a hidden
                    mechanism in the firmware of motherboards sold by the
                    Taiwanese manufacturer Gigabyte, whose components are
                    commonly used in gaming PCs and other high-performance
                    computers. Whenever a computer with the affected Gigabyte
                    motherboard restarts, Eclypsium found, code within the
                    motherboard's firmware invisibly initiates an updater
                    program that runs on the computer and in turn downloads and
                    executes another piece of software.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Eclypsium says the hidden code is meant to be an
                    innocuous tool to keep the motherboard's firmware updated,
                    researchers found that it's implemented insecurely,
                    potentially allowing the mechanism to be hijacked and used
                    to install malware instead of Gigabyte's intended program.
                    And because the updater program is triggered from the
                    computer's firmware, outside its operating system, it's
                    tough for users to remove or even discover.

                    "If you have one of these machines, you have to worry about
                    the fact that it's basically grabbing something from the
                    Internet and running it without you being involved, and
                    hasn't done any of this securely," says John Loucaides, who
                    leads strategy and research at Eclypsium. "The concept of
                    going underneath the end user and taking over their machine
                    doesn't sit well with most people."

                    researchers say are affected. Loucaides adds that users who
                    want to see which motherboard their computer uses can check
                    by going to "Start" in Windows and then "System

                    The system of methylation includes enzymes which modify
                    another protein by adding a small molecule, in this case a
                    methyl group, and 'tagging' it. The addition of methyl
                    groups can affect how some molecules act in the body and
                    changes to the methylation patterns of genes or proteins can
                    influence a person's risk of developing certain diseases,
                    including cancer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is the space that we've been working in experimentally
                    for a very long time," says Prof. Wilkins. "I set out to
                    characterize this particular type of cell modification
                    [methylation], but with a focus on working inside yeast, as
                    a model organism for human and animal cells."

                  <p>
                    [...] In any methylation process, there is a connection
                    between two proteins (the enzyme carrying the methyl group
                    and the protein being methylated), that make up the core
                    unit of this system. "So if there was more to be discovered,
                    there's essentially going to be an interaction between these
                    two proteins that we don't know about," says Dr. Hamey.

                    "We were able to use the knowledge of this connection to
                    catalog the existing evidence and determine whether there
                    are more of these connections that remain unknown—and if so,

                    to hit that goal, according to the IEA, annual investment
                    needs to reach $4.5 trillion in 2030—nearly triple current
                    spending.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some technologies are actually in great shape. Solar
                    spending just needs to keep growing as it has been for that
                    sector to keep pace with the 2050 goal. But there needs to
                    be much more spending in other areas, especially
                    technologies like energy storage and transmission lines—that
                    will help balance the grid as more solar and other
                    intermittent renewable power sources come online. There's
                    also a huge geographical imbalance, and poorer countries
                    will need a significant boost to help build up their
                    electrical grids and establish new technologies.

                  <p>
                    Investments are broadly on the right track, and I'm excited
                    to see what next year's report will hold. But there's still
                    definitely a long road ahead and a lot of building left to
                    do.

                    As with conventional plastics, though, bioplastics must
                    still be disposed of correctly. But research has found that
                    the labels and instructions on many biodegradable products
                    are often confusing and misleading. In a

                    labels of degradable, compostable and biodegradable

                    This could lead to biodegradable and non-biodegradable
                    plastics being disposed of incorrectly. Plastic that is
                    released into the environment may not decompose, and will
                    instead break down into small pieces of microplastic.

                    As the world uses more biodegradable plastic, we need to
                    make sure this material's environmental footprint is
                    minimized. With that in mind, improving labeling and
                    disposal instructions and improving access to industrial
                    composting could all help.

                    be called dystopian: Officers were directing the crowd,

                    the street as the robot rolled through the cluster of

                    If you take someone with intermediate knowledge of computing
                    in the right areas, and ask them how an x86 machine boots,
                    they'll probably start telling you about how the CPU first
                    comes up in real mode and starts executing code from the
                    8086 reset vector of FFFF:FFF0. This understanding of how an
                    x86 machine boots has remained remarkably persistent, as far
                    as I can tell because this basic narrative about the boot
                    process has been handed down from website to website,
                    generation to generation, largely unchanged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's also a pack of lies and hasn't reflected the true
                    nature of the boot process for some time. It's true the 8086
                    reset vector is still used, but only because it's a standard
                    "ABI" for the CPU to transfer control to the BIOS (whether
                    legacy PC BIOS or UEFI BIOS). In reality an awful lot
                    happens before this reset vector starts executing. Aside
                    from people having vaguely heard about the Intel Management
                    Engine, this modern reality of the boot process remains
                    largely unknown. It doesn't help that neither Intel nor AMD
                    have really gone out of their way to actually document what
                    the modern boot process looks like, and large parts of this
                    process are handled by vendor-supplied mystery firmware
                    blobs, which may as well be boxes with "???" written in
                    them. Mainly we have the substantial assistance of assorted
                    reverse engineers and security researchers to thank for the
                    fact that we even have a decent picture of what the modoern
                    x86 boot process actually looks like for both Intel and AMD.
                    I could write a whole article about that process — but
                    instead, I'd like to focus on something else.

                    the final black hole rings like a bell," explains Yanbei
                    Chen (Ph.D. '03), a professor of physics at Caltech and a
                    co-author of both studies. "The quality of the ringing, or
                    its timbre, may be different from the predictions of general
                    relativity if certain theories of quantum gravity are
                    correct. Our methods are designed to look for differences in
                    the quality of this ringdown phase, such as the harmonics
                    and overtones, for example."

                    The first paper, led by Caltech graduate student Dongjun Li,
                    reports a new single equation to describe how black holes
                    would ring within the framework of certain quantum gravity
                    theories, or in what scientists refer to as the
                    beyond-general-relativity regime.

                    <i>Physical Review Letters</i>, led by Caltech graduate
                    student Sizheng Ma, describes a new way to apply Li's
                    equation to actual data acquired by LIGO and its partners in
                    their next observational run. This data analysis approach
                    uses a series of filters to remove features of a black
                    hole's ringing predicted by general relativity, so that
                    potentially subtle, beyond-general-relativity signatures can
                    be revealed.

                    But where does the excess energy accumulate? It accumulates
                    under the form of heat in the different components of the
                    climate system (atmosphere, land, hydrosphere, cryosphere,
                    biosphere). And this is what explains why the Earth is
                    warming, or more globally, climate change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such an inventory corresponding to the period 1960-2020 has
                    been provided by a recently published study. This study
                    shows that the Earth system has been accumulating heat since
                    1971. Moreover, the rate of heat accumulation corresponding
                    to the period 2006-2020 is higher than that corresponding to
                    1971-2020. Most of the excess heat is stored in the ocean
                    (89 percent), mainly in the upper ocean (0-700 metres in
                    depth). The rest of the excess heat is stored in the land
                    (six percent) and the atmosphere (one percent), and has led
                    to the melting of the components of the cryosphere—glaciers,
                    ice sheets and sea ice (four percent).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to storing excess heat, the ocean is also an
                    important CO₂ sink, thus playing an essential role in the
                    regulation of the climate. However, the ocean will become
                    less efficient at capturing CO₂ with the increase in the
                    cumulative emissions of this gas. Why? Because of the
                    positive feedback between the ocean warming and the decrease
                    in the capacity of the oceans to absorb CO₂.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunately, the current state of the ocean is concerning.
                    In 2022, the ocean heat content reached a record high, and
                    58 percent of the ocean surface experienced at least one
                    marine heatwave. Since mid-March this year, the mean ocean
                    surface temperature is the highest ever observed since the
                    beginning of the satellite era. Among other negative impacts
                    on the marine ecosystems, marine heatwaves cause coral
                    bleaching events.

                    All new vehicles will be required to have a "more effective"
                    version of automatic emergency braking (AEB) under a new
                    rule proposed today by the US Department of Transportation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Around 90 percent of light-duty vehicles on the road today
                    come standard with AEB. But the Department of Transportation
                    is proposing a rule that would require automakers to adopt a
                    more robust version of the technology that can stop vehicles
                    traveling at higher speeds and detect vulnerable road users,
                    like cyclists and pedestrians, even at night.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "AEB systems are a big step forward for saving lives on our
                    roadways and preventing crashes," US DOT Deputy Secretary
                    Polly Trottenberg said at a press conference Wednesday.
                    "When deployed, AEB systems can potentially bring a vehicle
                    to a complete halt or at least slow them down so that
                    there's significantly less damage on impact."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2015, a majority of automakers made a voluntary
                    commitment to include AEB as standard in all new vehicles.
                    The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimates that
                    AEB, which uses forward-facing cameras and other sensors to
                    automatically apply the brakes when a crash is imminent,
                    would help prevent 28,000 crashes and 12,000 injuries by
                    2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But now, the Department of Transportation and the National
                    Highway Traffic Safety Administration is ready to go beyond
                    voluntary commitments, proposing a rule that would make AEB
                    mandatory in all new vehicles within four years of the rule
                    going into effect.

                    The nation's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requires
                    airlines to estimate the weight of passengers with one of
                    two options. The first option is to weigh in passengers, as
                    Air New Zealand is doing, or accept the standard weight set
                    by the CAA which is 190 pounds for those 13 years of age and
                    older. The standard weight was last reviewed in 2021 but
                    hasn't been increased since 2004 when the aviation authority
                    increased the average weight from 170 pounds to the current
                    estimated weight.

                    [...] Air New Zealand's survey will begin this week and will
                    run through July 2, and Alastair James, a load control
                    improvement specialist for the airline, said in the press
                    release, "We know stepping on the scales can be daunting. We
                    want to reassure our customers there is no visible display
                    anywhere. No one can see your weight – not even us! It's
                    completely anonymous." He added, "By weighing in, you'll be
                    helping us fly safely and efficiently every time."

                    According to said Standard Model and CERN, around 0.15
                    percent of Higgs bosons should decay into a Z boson and
                    photon, but the data indicates it's actually happening in
                    around 6.6 percent of decays picked up by the Large Hadron
                    Collider. In theoretical models that extend the Standard
                    Model to include other particles the Higgs' Z boson/photon
                    decay rate varies from the 0.15 percent predicted by the
                    standard Standard Model. In other words, something
                    interesting and potentially undiscovered is going on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Through a meticulous combination of the individual results
                    of ATLAS and CMS, we have made a step forward towards
                    unraveling yet another riddle of the Higgs boson," said
                    ATLAS physics coordinator Pamela Ferrari.

                    Of course, there's also the certainty of this discovery to
                    assess, and it's not as sure a thing as the

                    itself by CERN scientists in 2012. While the Higgs boson's
                    evidence was given a statistical significance of 5-Sigma
                    (roughly equivalent to a one in 3.5 million chance that its
                    discovery was an error), the Z boson/photon decay discovery
                    only rates 3.4-Sigma – still a pretty low chance of being a
                    mistaken observation, but greater than the discovery of the
                    Higgs boson itself.

                  <p>
                    In other words, the science continues with hopes more Higgs
                    observations will help clear things up. "This study is a
                    powerful test of the Standard Model. With the ongoing third
                    run of the LHC and the future High-Luminosity LHC, we will
                    be able to improve the precision of this test and probe ever
                    rarer Higgs decays," said CMS physics coordinator Florencia
                    Canelli.

                Last night, Linode restarted beryllium, the chat server, to do
                emergency maintenance on the host. At the time, I was doing work
                on creating the new staging and development environment and
                didn't think much of it at the time at 3am. Not long after, I
                got notification that the machine was restarting. I went to
                sleep, and put it out of my mind. What I didn't notice, since
                this is the first unexpected reboot in awhile was that there was
                no startup script for the IRCd, due to the migration from CentOS
                6 to Ubuntu 22.04. I got messages via Discord and SMS around 2PM
                EST (that is to say 12 hours later) that the IRC was down, so I
                got back home as quickly as possible and got it restarted.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will add "getting someone else beside me onto the backend" on
                the things to do in the very short term.

                    Computex Qualcomm has used its Computex keynote to pitch the
                    ubiquity of its Snapdragon platform as its challenge to x86
                    CPUs as the engine of PCs – by enabling more efficient AI
                    through offloading workloads to a constellation of devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Senior veep and general manager for mobile, compute, and XR
                    Alex Katouzian opened with a humblebrag that people may have
                    a Snapdragon CPU in a PC, smartphone, smartwatch and
                    extended reality glasses. Katouzian then observed rising
                    demand for AI workloads, and made the obvious point that
                    such workloads are very demanding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Speaking before a Computex crowd less than half the size of
                    that which gathered to hear
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/29/nvidia_mgx_spec_computex/"
                      >Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang</a
                    >, Katouzian outlined a plan to have Qualcomm enable AI
                    workloads to move around Snapdragon-powered devices –
                    assuming a user possesses several of them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Offloading AI in this way, he said, will mean XR glasses can
                    become smaller because they can be simpler devices once they
                    offload some AI workloads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kedar Kondap, Qualcomm's senior veep and GM for compute and
                    gaming, pointed out that local devices offer superior
                    performance per watt compared to cloudy datacenters. He
                    therefore predicted that AI workloads will be shared between
                    client devices and clouds – in real time, if doing so
                    enables the best and most efficient experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Qualcomm has
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/19/qualcomm_arm_server_chip/"

                    >
                    in datacenter processors, but the chip shop's reps made no
                    mention of such devices in the keynote. So while Kondap and
                    Katouzian suggested Snapdragon-powered PCs are redefining
                    the category, at this stage Qualcomm appears not to be
                    contemplating a full-stack attack.

                    Individuals identified their household's net worth as
                    positive, zero or negative. Couples with a positive net
                    worth, meaning their combined assets were higher than their
                    combined debts, were more likely to merge finances. Those
                    with a neutral net worth were less likely to combine, and
                    negative net worth did not have a significant impact either
                    way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To me, it was interesting that it wasn't driven primarily
                    by income. It wasn't necessarily the level of debt that
                    mattered, but the net worth," Grable said. "And debt could
                    include credit cards, student loans, auto loans, mortgages,
                    those kinds of things."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers also found that a growing household could push
                    couples toward joint accounts. With a one-person increase in
                    household size, the likelihood of a combined account
                    increased by about 20%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the other hand, individuals with a bachelor's degree or
                    higher level of education were slightly less likely to
                    combine accounts. And couples with multiple income earners
                    were about 50% less likely to pool finances. If both
                    partners have income, they may choose to manage that income
                    alone, researchers said. A non-working partner, however,
                    could face challenges if they could not access any household
                    income.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While this study provided insight into how couples
                    might approach their finances, there is not a hard and fast
                    rule for what financial integration style sets couples up
                    for success. That has to come from communication and seeking
                    out resources or help when issues arise, researchers said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There are so many different ways that couples do this.
                    What's most important is that they find a system that works
                    for them," Kruger said. "But when there is trust and
                    communication, couples can come to a place where they're
                    both happy with how they're managing things."

                    And no wonder: None of the EU's major institutions — the
                    Commission, the European Council or the European Parliament
                    — have Central Europeans at the helm, even as the power
                    balance in Europe shifts eastward after Russia's invasion of
                    Ukraine. Proportional representation in the Parliament also
                    means that the largest countries — France, Germany and Italy
                    — have the most power in terms of votes. Even if all the
                    Nordic, Baltic and Central European countries voted as a
                    block — which they don't — they would still have fewer votes
                    (191) than just France, Germany and Italy (251).

                  <p>
                    As a result, smaller countries then need to prioritize
                    focusing on the most critical issues — defense and security
                    — and the Parliament's ability to set Europe's tech agenda
                    is then

                  <p>
                    But just as the power balance on defense and deterrence is
                    shifting to the east and north, so are the economic
                    headwinds when it comes to tech innovation and investment.

                    Paris. And while unicorns — or firms valued at $1 billion or
                    more and are still predominantly privately owned — in
                    Western Europe still raise nearly double the amount of money

                    While NASA folk figured that out, Perseverance moved towards
                    its next goal – but that created new problems.

                    scout ahead for the wheeled rover. And NASA operates a

                    became imperative to get Ingenuity moving.

                    ensure vehicle safety and banking on solid communications
                    from the rover's imminent proximity, the team uplinked the

                    team was relieved to see the successful flight telemetry in
                    the Sol 763 downlink the following morning," Brown wrote.

                    designed to fly just five times, so has already vastly
                    exceeded expectations.

                    We tend to believe that if our Android phones are lost or
                    stolen, a fingerprint lock will ensure that the sensitive
                    data they hold stays safe. But Chinese researchers have
                    found a way to break through this protection by using a
                    brute-force attack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To protect against brute-force attacks, Android phones
                    usually have safeguards such as limiting the number of
                    attempts a user can make, as well as liveness detection. But
                    the researchers bypassed these by using two zero-day
                    vulnerabilities dubbed Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and
                    Match-After-Lock (MAL).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As per
                    <a
                      href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-phones-are-vulnerable-to-fingerprint-brute-force-attacks/"
                      >Bleeping Computer</a
                    >, it was also discovered that biometric data on the
                    fingerprint sensors' Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
                    lacked comprehensive protection, thereby allowing a
                    man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to steal the fingerprints.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers tested the brute-force attack, called
                    BrutePrint, on ten popular smartphone models. They were able
                    to perform an unlimited number of fingerprint login attempts
                    on the Android and HarmonyOS (Huawei) phones. iOS devices
                    fared much better, allowing just ten additional attempts on
                    the iPhone SE and iPhone 7, bringing the total to 15, which
                    isn't enough for a brute-force attack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The good news is that this isn't the easiest attack to
                    pull off. Not only would someone need physical access to a
                    target phone and a some time, but they'd also require access
                    to a fingerprint database from either biometric data leaks
                    or academic datasets. Some hardware is also required, though
                    it only costs around $15. However, the technique could find
                    use with law enforcement and state-sponsored actors.

                    trying to make it possible to beam solar energy from space.
                    In 2015, the nation made a breakthrough when JAXA scientists
                    successfully beamed 1.8 kilowatts of power, enough energy to
                    power an electric kettle,

                    to a wireless receiver. Now, Japan is poised to bring the
                    technology one step closer to reality.

                  <p>
                    [...] The project, led by Naoki Shinohara, a Kyoto
                    University professor who has been working on space-based
                    solar energy since 2009, will attempt to deploy a series of
                    small satellites in orbit. Those will then try to beam the
                    solar energy the arrays collect to ground-based receiving
                    stations hundreds of miles away.

                    Using orbital solar panels and microwaves to send energy to
                    Earth was first proposed in 1968. Since then, a few
                    countries, including
                    <a
                      href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-18-china-solar-farm-power-station-space-2025.html"
                    ></a>
                    and the US, have spent time and money pursuing the idea. The
                    technology is appealing because orbital solar arrays
                    represent a potentially unlimited renewable energy supply.
                    In space, solar panels can collect energy no matter the time
                    of day, and by using microwaves to beam the power they
                    produce, clouds aren't a concern either. However, even if
                    Japan successfully deploys a set of orbital solar arrays,
                    the tech would still be closer to science fiction than fact.
                    That's because producing an array that can generate 1
                    gigawatt of power – or about the output of one nuclear
                    reactor – would cost about $7 billion with currently
                    available technologies.

                    [...] Tesla may not be able to rest on its laurels for long.
                    "Even for established brands like Tesla, winning the
                    confidence of consumers is vital," says Håkan Lutz, CEO and
                    founder of the EV mini-mobility company Luvly. "Continued
                    safety failings and production delays are leading customers
                    to question whether self-driving vehicles will ever be a
                    reality, and delays to the Cybertruck—announced four years
                    ago—are not doing the company any favors in instilling
                    confidence."

                    Investors seem to have already lost patience. Tesla's share
                    price peaked at $407.36 in 2021 and has since fallen by more
                    than half, closing on May 25, 2023, at $184.47 a share.

                    procedures (TTPs) is living off the land, which uses
                    built-in network administration tools to perform their
                    objectives. This TTP allows the actor to evade detection by
                    blending in with normal Windows system and network
                    activities, avoid endpoint detection and response (EDR)
                    products that would alert on the introduction of third-party
                    applications to the host, and limit the amount of activity
                    that is captured in default logging configurations. Some of
                    the built-in tools this actor uses are: wmic, ntdsutil,
                    netsh, and PowerShell. The advisory provides examples of the
                    actor's commands along with detection signatures to aid
                    network defenders in hunting for this activity.

                    MediaTek's Dimensity 9200 is one of the most powerful
                    smartphone processors of 2023, taking the fight to the
                    Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in a few areas. Now, the Taiwanese
                    chipmaker has shed more light on its next-generation
                    chipset.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    MediaTek announced on Weibo that its next-generation
                    flagship Dimensity chipset would be powered by Arm's newly
                    announced Cortex-X4 CPU core, Cortex-A720 CPU core, and Arm
                    Immortalis Mali-G720 GPU. Check out the accompanying video
                    below(*).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This isn't a surprise, as MediaTek has utilized the latest
                    CPU and GPU tech in its flagship silicon for the past two
                    years. But the news means that you can expect the
                    next-generation Dimensity chipset (presumably called the
                    Dimensity 9300) to be a major rival to the Snapdragon 8 Gen
                    3 processor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Taiwanese chipmaker also noted that the new chipset will
                    offer a "groundbreaking" architecture, adding that the
                    processor will enable improved multitasking and better
                    performance in "heavily" multi-threaded apps and games.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    MediaTek didn't mention whether its new processor will use
                    the brand-new Cortex-A520 little CPU core which debuted
                    alongside the Cortex-X4 and A720. This could be a case of
                    the company not wanting to reveal too many major details
                    right now. It's also theoretically possible (but unlikely)
                    that the new processor simply doesn't have little cores,
                    although we haven't seen a major flagship chipmaker ditch
                    these little cores before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In saying so, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 switched from four
                    little CPU cores to three (adding a fourth medium core
                    instead). Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 leaks also point to the company
                    switching to just two little cores (adding a fifth medium
                    CPU core). So it certainly seems like there's a trend to
                    reduce the number of little cores, but cutting them all
                    together would be an aggressive move and potentially have
                    ramifications for efficiency and multi-core performance.

                    as the best way to enjoy the web almost ad-free. Still, the
                    San Francisco-based corporation is well known for forcing
                    its own ads on users every now and then.

                    on Firefox as a "best friend" for users forced to watch too
                    many unsolicited advertisements while browsing the web. The
                    average person sees "an average of 4,000 ads a day," Mozilla
                    says, and that's a bit too much. And yet, Mozilla recently
                    joined the crowd of ad-serving companies with an
                    "unskippable" message trying to promote the company's own
                    paid VPN service.

                    This past week, Mozilla started to show fullscreen
                    advertising about its VPN service to disgruntled Firefox

                    that goes against Firefox's supposed core values. The ad was
                    shown through the browser's Messaging System, so it was
                    difficult to block with a traditional ad-blocker like uBlock
                    Origin.

                    "resolved" by Mozilla developers, as the ad was working as
                    intended and there was nothing to fix. Power users could

                    The highest amount of CsMPs were found near to the school's
                    entrance (up to 2481 particles per m2), while significant
                    (but lower) amounts of CsMPs were found on the second floor
                    (up to 1273 particles per m2). This shows penetration of the
                    tiny fallout particles deep into the building.
                    Interestingly, the CsMP numbers and the proportion of Cs
                    radioactivity attributed to CsMPs in nearby outdoor samples
                    were much lower (23–63 particles/g of dust or soil and
                    1.14–1.61% or total Cs radioactivity, respectively).

                    [...] Professor Bernd Grambow, a co-investigator from the
                    University of Nantes added, "Any decontamination strategy
                    needs to acknowledge that in close vicinity to the power
                    plant, large differences in contamination levels may be
                    encountered and that both ionic and particle bound Cs needs
                    to be analyzed and removed, with the latter being
                    particularly dangerous to cleaning workers."

                  <p>
                    Professor Rodney C. Ewing of Stanford University further
                    added, "This study is latest of an extended series of papers
                    that deal with the composition, characteristics, formation,
                    and number of CsMPs. The groundbreaking aspect of these
                    works is the combined application of multiple advanced
                    techniques e.g., the team's autoradiography methods,
                    high-resolution electron microscopy, and isotopic analysis.
                    The atomic-scale resolution of these studies provides a
                    model for future studies of environmental contamination."

                    [...] Intel will still include the Gaussian Neural
                    Acceleration low-power AI acceleration block that already
                    exists on its chips, marked as 'GNA 3.5' on the SoC tile in
                    the diagram (more on this below). You can also spot the 'VPU
                    2.7' block that comprises the new Movidius-based VPU block.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like Intel's stylized render, the patent image is also just
                    a graphical rendering with no real correlation to the actual
                    physical size of the dies. It's easy to see that with so
                    many external interfaces, like the memory controllers, PCIe,
                    USB, and SATA, not to mention the media and display engines
                    and power management, that the VPU cores simply can't
                    consume much of the die area on the SoC tile. For now, the
                    amount of die area that Intel has dedicated to this engine
                    is unknown.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The VPU is designed for sustained AI workloads, but Meteor
                    Lake also includes a CPU, GPU, and GNA engine that can run
                    various AI workloads. Intel's Intel says the VPU is
                    primarily for background tasks, while the GPU steps in for
                    heavier parallelized work. Meanwhile, the CPU addresses
                    light low-latency inference work. Some AI workloads can also
                    run on both the VPU and GPU simultaneously, and Intel has
                    enabled mechanisms that allow developers to target the
                    different compute layers based on the needs of the
                    application at hand. This will ultimately result in higher
                    performance at lower power -- a key goal of using the AI
                    acceleration VPU.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Intel's chips currently use the GNA block for low-power AI
                    inference for audio and video processing functions, and the
                    GNA unit will remain on Meteor Lake. However, Intel says it
                    is already running some of the GNA-focused code on the VPU
                    and achieving better results, with a heavy implication that
                    Intel will transition to the VPU entirely with future chips
                    and remove the GNA engine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Intel also disclosed that Meteor Lake has a coherent fabric
                    that enables a unified memory subsystem, meaning it can
                    easily share data among the compute elements. This is a key
                    functionality that is similar in concept to other contenders
                    in the CPU AI space, like Apple with its M-series and AMD's
                    Ryzen 7040 chips.

                    The global market for refurbished and used mobile phones is
                    expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.45%
                    from 2022 to 2030. This means it can move from $52.34
                    billion in 2021 to $64.10 billion in 2022. Several estimates
                    list the US as the fastest growing market for refurbished
                    and used mobile phones. A refurbished phone goes through a
                    process of quality check however, used phones can be dead at
                    the time of selling.

                    Some of the key players who champion the market of

                    Version Communications, and Cashify. Besides these, Walmart,
                    eBay, Paytm, Huawei, Yaantra, and AT&amp;T Inc. are close
                    contenders. Seeing the brands of phones while making a
                    purchase is not enough to escape falling into legal
                    complications.

                  <p>
                    Africa and Australia have large swathes of sandy coastline
                    and coastal wetlands. By contrast, Europe and Russia's cold
                    coastline lacks mangroves or tropical coastal wetlands.
                    These differences drive the changes we found in how
                    different coasts take up or emit greenhouse gases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The strongest coastal greenhouse gas sink is Southeast Asia,
                    because of its extensive and productive tropical mangrove
                    forests and seagrasses which soak up large amounts of CO₂.
                    North America's coast is another excellent sink for
                    greenhouse gases, with its salt marshes, mangroves,
                    seagrasses—and Canada's fjords, glacier-made valleys filled
                    with seawater.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Australia and New Zealand have long stretches of
                    coastal wetlands soaking up CO₂, this is offset by a large
                    number of estuaries, many of which are a source of
                    greenhouse gases produced by decaying organic matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Coasts in Europe and Russia actually release more greenhouse
                    gases than they absorb. Their many polluted tidal estuaries
                    release greenhouse gases, but the colder climate means this
                    region has fewer coastal wetlands to soak these gases back
                    up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But across the three main greenhouse gases, eight out of the
                    ten world coastal regions are a net greenhouse gas sink.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some coasts soak up greenhouse gases while others emit more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And by reducing nutrient overload, organic matter and
                    wastewater flows into our coastal waterways, we can cut the
                    greenhouse gases emitted by polluted estuaries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Protecting our coasts is good for us, for nature and
                    for the earth system as it plunges into the climate crisis.

                    Mandiant says that not only do hackers regularly  adapt and
                    make use of red team tools to facilitate real-world attacks,
                    but its analysis of CosmicEnergy reveals that the malware's
                    functionality is also comparable to that of other malware
                    variants targeting industrial control systems (ICS), such as
                    Industroyer, thus posing a "plausible threat to affected

                  <p>
                    Mandiant tells TechCrunch that it has not observed any
                    CosmicEnergy attacks in the wild and notes that the malware
                    lacks discovery capabilities, which means hackers would need
                    to perform some internal reconnaissance to obtain
                    environment information, such as IP addresses and
                    credentials, before launching an attack.

                  <p>
                    However, the researchers added that because the malware
                    targets the IEC-104, a network protocol commonly used in
                    industrial environments that was also targeted during the
                    2016 attack on Ukraine's power grid, CosmicEnergy poses a
                    real threat to organizations involved in electricity
                    transmission and distribution.

                    in a bad way. To me, the lab-grown burger had a strong
                    resemblance to the one from Impossible Foods. The texture
                    was similar, which makes sense since it was mostly made from
                    plants.

                    Taste-wise, I thought the lab-grown meat may have been a bit
                    closer to the beef burger, but I found myself wondering if
                    I'd feel the same way if I didn't know which was which. Was
                    my brain tricking me into thinking it tasted more like meat,
                    since I knew that there were animal cells in it? I took
                    bites of all three burgers again to try to figure it out.
                    I'm still not sure.

                    lab-grown meat, including whether companies will be able to
                    produce it at commercial scale, how expensive it'll turn out
                    to be, what the climate impacts will actually look like, and
                    whether anyone will eat this in the first place.

                    [...] Unfortunately, the lawsuits have had little effect on
                    the overall number of phishing attacks and phishing-related
                    domains, which have steadily increased in volume over the
                    years.  Piscitello said the phishers tend to gravitate
                    toward registrars that offer the least resistance and lowest
                    price per domain. And with

                  <p>
                    "The abuse of a new top-level domain is largely the result
                    of one registrar's portfolio," Piscitello told
                    KrebsOnSecurity. "Alibaba or Namecheap or another registrar
                    will run a promotion for a cheap domain, and then we'll see
                    flocking and migration of the phishers to that TLD. It's
                    like strip mining, where they'll buy hundreds or thousands
                    of domains, use those in a campaign, exhaust that TLD and
                    then move on to another provider."

                  <p>
                    Piscitello said despite the steep drop in phishing domains
                    coming out of Freenom, the alternatives available to
                    phishers are many. After all, there are more than 2,000
                    accredited domain registrars, not to mention dozens of
                    services that let anyone set up a website for free without
                    even owning a domain.

                    "There is no evidence that the trend line is even going to
                    level off," he said. "I think what the Meta lawsuit tells us
                    is that litigation is like giving someone a

                      >standing eight count</a
                    >. It temporarily disrupts a process. And in that sense,
                    litigation appears to be working."

                    when they can't get into popular upper-level electives. But
                    they usually just gripe. Paras Jha was an exception. Enraged

                    computer-science elective at

                      >Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey</a

                    On Wednesday night, 19 November 2014, at 10:00 p.m. EST—as
                    the registration period for first-year students in spring
                    courses had just opened—Paras launched his first distributed
                    denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. He had assembled an army of
                    some 40,000 bots, primarily in Eastern Europe and China, and
                    unleashed them on the Rutgers central authentication server.
                    The botnet sent thousands of fraudulent requests to
                    authenticate, overloading the server. Paras's classmates
                    could not get through to register.

                    small cybersecurity firm based in Massachusetts, as its
                    DDoS-mitigation provider. He claimed that Rutgers chose the
                    cheapest company. "Just to show you the poor quality of
                    Incapsula's network, I have gone ahead and decimated the
                    Rutgers network (and parts of Incapsula), in the hopes that
                    you will pick another provider that knows what they are
                    doing."

                  <p>
                    Paras's fourth attack on the Rutgers network, taking place
                    during finals, caused chaos and panic on campus. Paras
                    reveled in his ability to shut down a major state
                    university, but his ultimate objective was to force it to
                    abandon Incapsula. Paras had started his own DDoS-mitigation
                    service, ProTraf Solutions, and wanted Rutgers to pick
                    ProTraf over Incapsula. And he wasn't going to stop
                    attacking his school until it switched.

                    Despite their apparent success, LLMs are not (really)
                    'models of language' but are statistical models of the
                    regularities found in linguistic communication. Models and
                    theories should explain a phenomenon (e.g., F = ma) but LLMs
                    are not explainable because explainability requires
                    structured semantics and reversible compositionality that
                    these models do not admit (see
                    <a
                      href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/264604-new-research-vindicates-fodor-and-pylyshyn-no-explainable-ai-without-structured-semantics/fulltext"

                    >
                    for more details). In fact, and due to the subsymbolic
                    nature of LLMs, whatever 'knowledge' these models acquire
                    about language will always be buried in billions of
                    microfeatures (weights), none of which is meaningful on its
                    own. In addition to the lack of explainability, LLMs will
                    always generate biased and toxic language since they are
                    susceptible to the biases and toxicity in their training
                    data (<a
                      href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922"
                      >Bender et. al., 2021</a
                    >). Moreover, and due to their statistical nature, these
                    systems will never be trusted to decide on the
                    "truthfulness" of the content they generate (<a
                      href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03494"
                      >Borji, 2023</a
                    >) – LLMs ingest text and they cannot decide which fragments
                    of text are true and which are not. Note that none of these
                    problematic issues are a function of scale but are
                    paradigmatic issues that are a byproduct of the architecture
                    of deep neural networks (DNNs) and their training
                    procedures. Finally, and contrary to some misguided
                    narrative, these LLMs do not have human-level understanding
                    of language (for lack of space we do not discuss here the
                    limitations of LLMs regarding their linguistic competence,

                    So enjoy the news about "the potential danger of AI". But
                    watch and read this news like you're watching a really funny
                    sitcom. Make a nice drink (or a nice cup of tea), listen and
                    smile. And then please, sleep well, because all is OK, no
                    matter what some self-appointed god fathers say. They might
                    know about LLMs, but they apparently never heard of BDIs.

                The author's conclusion seems to be that although AI may pose a
                threat to certain professions, it doesn't endanger the existence
                of humanity.

                    NAND, Tanguy explains, is happiest within a relatively
                    narrow temperature band. "NAND flash actually likes to be
                    'hot' in that 60° to 70° [celcius] range in order to program
                    a cell because when it's that hot, those electrons can move
                    a little bit easier," he explained.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Go a little too hot — say 80°C — and things become
                    problematic, however. At these temps, you risk the SSD's
                    built-in safety mechanisms forcibly powering down the system
                    to prevent damage. However, before this happens users are
                    likely to see the performance of their drives plummet, as
                    the SSD's controller throttles itself to prevent data loss.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The latter is one of the reasons why even during the PCIe
                    4.0 generation it wasn't uncommon to see aluminum or even
                    copper heatsinks sold alongside premium models.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The takeaway is that with PCIe 5.0 SSDs — the performance
                    oriented models in particular — some kind of cooler is
                    necessary to achieve peak performance. Whether it needs to
                    be actively cooled is another question entirely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There's also the potential for these SSD's larger
                    coolers to interfere with other components, like CPU tower
                    coolers or GPUs. This is because the majority of PCIe 5.0
                    slots are located just below the CPU socket to minimize
                    trace length to ensure signal integrity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, do you really need a liquid cooled SSD? Probably not,
                    but if you want one anyway, we can't say we blame you.
