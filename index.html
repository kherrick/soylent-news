                    At the same time, traits detrimental to the everyday lives
                    of pet dogs may be valuable to working dogs or dogs used in
                    dog sports. For example, impulsiveness can be useful in dog
                    sports or work-related tasks where fast reactions and
                    excitability can be assets, while independence (as opposed
                    to reliance on humans) may be a valuable trait in scent
                    work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results will help to better identify the kinds of traits
                    in dogs that facilitate everyday life with them, improving
                    the welfare of both owner and dog. "In an earlier study, we
                    observed differences between breeds and sex in different
                    test sections, and these results can together help in
                    choosing a suitable individual puppy," Tiira says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This is the first test package available to all dog
                    owners in which a connection to the dog's trainability and
                    also to the rate of learning has been observed. Thanks to
                    the smartDOG test already being available, Finnish dog
                    owners can directly make use of the research findings. This
                    research dataset of more than 6,000 dogs is continuously
                    growing, and next we will investigate how early these traits
                    can be seen in puppies, as well as their heritability,"
                    Tiira sums up.

                    OpenAI has revealed operations linked to Russia, China, Iran
                    and Israel have been using its artificial intelligence tools
                    to create and spread disinformation, as technology becomes a
                    powerful weapon in information warfare in an election-heavy
                    year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The San Francisco-based maker of the ChatGPT chatbot said in
                    a report on Thursday that five covert influence operations
                    had used its AI models to generate text and images at a high
                    volume, with fewer language errors than previously, as well
                    as to generate comments or replies to their own posts.
                    OpenAI's policies prohibit the use of its models to deceive
                    or mislead others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Microsoft-backed OpenAI said it was committed to
                    uncovering such disinformation campaigns and was building
                    its own AI-powered tools to make detection and analysis
                    "more effective." It added its safety systems already made
                    it difficult for the perpetrators to operate, with its
                    models refusing in multiple instances to generate the text
                    or images asked for.

                    Kaspersky has released a new virus removal tool named KVRT
                    for the Linux platform, allowing users to scan their systems
                    and remove malware and other known threats for free.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The security firm notes that despite the common
                    misconception that Linux systems are intrinsically secure
                    from threats, there has been a constant supply of "in the
                    wild" examples that prove otherwise, most recently, the XZ
                    Utils backdoor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kaspersky's new tool isn't a real-time threat protection
                    tool but a standalone scanner that can detect malware,
                    adware, legitimate programs abused for malicious purposes,
                    and other known threats and offers to clean them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Our application can scan system memory, startup
                    objects, boot sectors, and all files in the operating system
                    for known malware. It scans files of all formats — including
                    archived ones," says Kaspersky.

                    Monday with six planets appearing in alignment.
                  </p>

                    and Uranus will take part in the parade – which occurs when
                    planets gather on the same side of the sun.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prof Danny Steeghs, of the University of Warwick said the
                    event, which should be visible around the world, was due to
                    occur around sunrise and would be rather low in the east,
                    meaning the alignment would need some equipment to see
                    properly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Uranus and Neptune will be faint, so viewers will require
                    good binoculars to see them," he said, adding that the
                    proximity of
                    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/jupiter"

                    and Mercury to the sun would restrict their view.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    The animals are the first transgenic echinoderms, the phylum
                    that includes starfish, sea cucumbers and other marine
                    animals. Hamdoun's mission is to make genetically modified
                    urchins available to researchers anywhere, not just those
                    who happen to work in research facilities at the edge of the
                    Pacific Ocean.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The lab's breakthrough, and its focus on making the
                    animals freely available to fellow scientists, will "allow
                    us to explore how evolution has solved a lot of really
                    complicated life problems," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers tend to study mice, flies and the like not
                    because the animals' biology is best suited to answer their
                    questions but because "all the tools that were necessary to
                    get at your questions were built up in just a few species,"
                    said Deirdre Lyons, an associate professor of biology at
                    Scripps who worked with Hamdoun on early research related to
                    the project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Expanding the range of animals available for sophisticated
                    lab work is like adding colors to an artist's palette, Lyons
                    said, "Now you can go get the color that you really want,
                    that best fits your vision, rather than being stuck with a
                    few models."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Hamdoun vividly recalls the time he spent earlier in
                    his career trying to track down random snippets of DNA
                    necessary for his research, the disappointment and
                    frustration of writing to professors and former postdocs
                    only to find that the material had long been lost. He'd
                    rather future generations of scientists spend their time on
                    discovery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Biology is really interesting," he said. "The more people
                    can get access to it, the more we're going to learn."

                    from Sony's internal Game &amp; Network Services business
                    reports, the PS5 has raked in $106 billion in sales since
                    launching in November 2020. That's quite the figure for a
                    console that's 'only' been on the market for around three
                    and a half years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, several aspects require clarification. That $106
                    billion doesn't just account for PS5 hardware and software
                    sales – it covers Sony's entire gaming business during the
                    current generation: PS4 sales, older game releases,
                    subscriptions, the works. It's the total pie, not just the
                    PS5 slice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the numbers are impressive when you consider the PS4
                    generation 'only' pulled in $107 billion across its entire
                    seven-year run from 2013 to 2019. With the PS5 closing in on
                    that total revenue after just four years, it's clearly on
                    track to become Sony's biggest console cash cow ever.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The secret sauce seems to be players spending more cash on
                    the PS5 ecosystem as a whole. While the PS4 outsold its
                    successor by a massive 117 million to 56 million units, the
                    higher PS5 price tag combined with increased spending on
                    DLC, microtransactions, services, and accessories is giving
                    Sony a bigger bang for its buck.
                  </p>

                    [...] While the researchers have analyzed attacks on home
                    and small office routers before, they said two things make
                    this latest one stand out. They explained:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, this campaign resulted in a hardware-based
                    replacement of the affected devices, which likely indicates
                    that the attacker corrupted the firmware on specific models.
                    The event was unprecedented due to the number of units
                    affected—no attack that we can recall has required the
                    replacement of over 600,000 devices. In addition, this type
                    of attack has only ever happened once before, with AcidRain
                    used as a precursor to an active military invasion.

                    The second unique aspect is that this campaign was confined
                    to a particular ASN. Most previous campaigns we’ve seen
                    target a specific router model or common vulnerability and
                    have effects across multiple providers’ networks. In this
                    instance, we observed that both Sagemcom and ActionTec
                    devices were impacted at the same time, both within the same
                    provider’s network.This led us to assess it was not the
                    result of a faulty firmware update by a single manufacturer,
                    which would normally be confined to one device model or
                    models from a given company. Our analysis of the Censys data
                    shows the impact was only for the two in question. This
                    combination of factors led us to conclude the event was
                    likely a deliberate action taken by an unattributed
                    malicious cyber actor, even if we were not able to recover
                    the destructive module.

                    With no clear idea how the routers came to be infected, the
                    researchers can only offer the usual generic advice for
                    keeping such devices free of malware. That includes
                    installing security updates, replacing default passwords
                    with strong ones, and regular rebooting. ISPs and other
                    organizations that manage routers should follow additional
                    advice for securing the management interfaces for
                    administering the devices.

                    The CEO of South Korean chemical firm SKC made a big bet on
                    the US CHIPS Act when he decided to grow his manufacturing
                    site in the American South. That gamble has now paid off
                    with some CHIPS change coming SKC's way to help bankroll its
                    factory expansion.

                    Thursday it is awarding $75 million from the CHIPS Act
                    subsidy pool to SKC subsidiary Absolics to support the
                    construction of additional facilities in Covington, Georgia.
                    Those facilities will be focused on the development and
                    production of glass semiconductor substrates.

                  <p>
                    According to the department, it's the first CHIPS Act
                    investment in a commercial facility to manufacture new
                    advanced materials for the semiconductor industry – that
                    material being glass substrates. The $53 billion CHIPS
                    funding pool was created by the White House and Congress to
                    boost the development and manufacturing of semiconductors on
                    US soil to help the country wean itself off foreign
                    suppliers.

                    "An important part of the success of [the] CHIPS program is
                    ensuring the United States is a global leader in every part
                    of the semiconductor supply chain," said Commerce Secretary
                    Gina Raimondo. "The advanced semiconductor packaging
                    technologies Absolics is working on will help to achieve
                    that goal."

                    Absolics' parent is a subsidiary of the South Korean
                    mega-chaebol SK Group, which includes among its other
                    subsidiaries chip giant SK hynix. Having an in-house maker
                    of cutting-edge substrates makes perfect sense given the SK

                    an expansion of the company's decades-old Covington plant
                    for glass semiconductor work. SK pledged it would spend $240
                    million on a 120,000-square-foot Absolics facility to
                    manufacture glass substrates, which Park predicted "will be
                    the key material in the high-performance computing industry"
                    in the coming years. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2022 Park said glass substrates made in the US would
                    largely be shipped to Asia for semiconductor manufacturing,
                    with some surely ending up at SK hynix. The reason for
                    making them in America, he said, was because US semi
                    manufacturing was booming [...] and a local glass substrate
                    plant would be well-positioned to benefit from demand for
                    the material.

                  <p>The Making of Donkey Kong for the Atari 2600</p>
                  <p>
                    In the summer of 1982, I spent about three months creating a
                    list of 4,096 numbers, meticulously ensuring that every
                    single number was the right value, and in the correct place
                    in the list. When I finished, the only tangible evidence of
                    my work was that long list of numbers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the list was complete, after nearly 1,000 hours of
                    work, the former Connecticut Leather Company¹ put the
                    numbers (in order) into a computer memory chip and plastic
                    case and sold it at stores throughout the country. And
                    people actually bought it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The list of numbers that I created was known to the public
                    as the Atari 2600 version of the hit coin-op video game
                    Donkey Kong. To create the list, I wrote a computer program
                    in 6502 assembly language in about 3 months, with little
                    sleep. With enormous pressure to submit final code in time
                    for holiday sales, I finished the game with a push of 72
                    straight hours at my desk, after which I was told that I
                    looked like a zombie.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For background, Nintendo's Donkey Kong (the arcade
                    game) was a breakthrough in video game design, and one of
                    the most successful coin-operated games of the early 1980's.
                    To be clear, I did not invent Donkey Kong. The game was
                    designed by the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto, who has gone on
                    to be possibly the most successful video game designer in
                    history. It was the first video game to feature Mario, who
                    went on to fame and fortune in the Super Mario Bros series
                    of games (though in Donkey Kong he was referred to only as
                    Jumpman). Donkey Kong was one of the first video games to
                    use cartoon-quality animation and storytelling to draw the
                    player into the action. My role was limited to creating an
                    Atari 2600 version of Miyamoto's masterpiece.

                    Noise-canceling headphones have gotten very good at creating
                    an auditory blank slate. But allowing certain sounds from a
                    wearer's environment through the erasure still challenges
                    researchers. The latest edition of Apple's AirPods Pro, for

                    for wearers — sensing when they're in conversation, for
                    instance — but the user has little control over whom to
                    listen to or when this happens.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A University of Washington team has developed an artificial
                    intelligence system that lets a user wearing headphones look
                    at a person speaking for three to five seconds to "enroll"
                    them. The system, called "Target Speech Hearing," then
                    cancels all other sounds in the environment and plays just
                    the enrolled speaker's voice in real time even as the
                    listener moves around in noisy places and no longer faces
                    the speaker.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] To use the system, a person wearing off-the-shelf
                    headphones fitted with microphones taps a button while
                    directing their head at someone talking. The sound waves
                    from that speaker's voice then should reach the microphones
                    on both sides of the headset simultaneously; there's a
                    16-degree margin of error. The headphones send that signal
                    to an on-board embedded
                    <a
                      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer"

                    >
                    where the team's machine learning software learns the
                    desired speaker's vocal patterns. The system latches onto
                    that speaker's voice and continues to play it back to the
                    listener, even as the pair moves around. The system's
                    ability to focus on the enrolled voice improves as the
                    speaker keeps talking,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Currently the TSH system can enroll[sic] only one
                    speaker at a time, and it's only able to enroll [sic] a
                    speaker when there is not another loud voice coming from the
                    same direction as the target speaker's voice. If a user
                    isn't happy with the sound quality, they can run another
                    enrollment on the speaker to improve the clarity.

                It would seem the embedded single board computer would get very
                good at only allowing the voice of a speaker who talks too much.

                    had its Google Cloud account wiped out due to some kind of
                    mistake on Google's end. At the time, UniSuper indicated it
                    had lost everything it had stored with Google, even its
                    backups, and that caused two weeks of downtime for its

                        During the initial deployment of a Google Cloud VMware
                        Engine (GCVE) Private Cloud for the customer using an
                        internal tool, there was an inadvertent misconfiguration
                        of the GCVE service by Google operators due to leaving a
                        parameter blank. This had the unintended and then
                        unknown consequence of defaulting the customer's GCVE
                        Private Cloud to a fixed term, with automatic deletion
                        at the end of that period. The incident trigger and the
                        downstream system behavior have both been corrected to

                    that were stored in Google Cloud Storage in the same region
                    were not impacted by the deletion, and, along with third
                    party backup software, were instrumental in aiding the rapid
                    restoration." It's hard to square these two statements,
                    especially with the two-week recovery period. The goal of a
                    backup is to be quickly restored; so either UniSuper's
                    backups didn't get deleted and weren't effective, leading to
                    two weeks of downtime, or they would have been effective had
                    they not been partially or completely wiped out.

                    human-in-the-loop, as appropriate," and it confirmed these

                >
                was that an employee in the finance department was invited for a
                video conference with the CFO and other 'senior officers'.
                During that video conference, this employee was given the order
                to funnel a total of $25 million (US) to 5 local bank accounts
                through 15 transactions, which the employee duly did. After what
                were quite possibly a couple of sleepless nights, she decided to
                check with her higher-ups, which (one presumes) resulted in a
                few heart arrythmias.
              </p>
              <p>
                Turns out that everybody else on that video conference call was
                a digital fake.
              </p>
              <p>
                The current working hypothesis is that the scammer(s) used past
                online conferences to train AI to digitally recreate a scenario
                where the CFO ordered money transfers. So that adds public video
                postings as an additional headache to CIOs, CFOs and just about
                anyone who has decision power over rather large amounts of
                money. As if

                Now, remember: this is news because it hit a big company. But
                let your <i>schadenfreude</i> not stand in the way of a bitter
                realisation: the inescapable economic trend is that what was
                once reserved for the rich, will be made accessible for the
                ordinary people too.

                    The microbes that live in your gut are having their moment
                    in the sun. Even if you haven't been following the research,
                    you can't have missed the hundreds of adverts for probiotics
                    and prebiotics, aimed at selling you products to keep your
                    microbiome healthy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other microbiomes have also recently been discovered, and
                    these too play an important role in your health. Your mouth,
                    nasal cavity, skin and scalp all have their own unique
                    microbiomes. Some have even proposed that the brain has its
                    own microbiome.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea that the brain has a microbiome was first suggested
                    in 2013, but it didn't get much attention. This is mostly
                    due to the longstanding belief that the brain is a sterile
                    organ, shielded from the rest of the body and from harmful
                    agents that are circulating in our blood.<br />...<br />In
                    healthy brains, the so-called "blood-brain barrier" shields
                    the brain from the blood and any harmful substances
                    dissolved in it. However, during ageing and in neurological
                    diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, this protective
                    barrier becomes leaky and blood and harmful substances can
                    enter the brain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A group of researchers from the University of
                    Edinburgh compared the brains of people with Alzheimer's
                    disease to healthy brains. The brains of people with
                    Alzheimer's harboured more bacteria and fungi than healthy
                    people. But they did find several species of fungi, bacteria
                    and other microorganisms in healthy brains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The human brain microbiome was found to be a subset (about
                    20%) of the gut microbiome. Although more bacteria were
                    found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's, the
                    researchers were not able to find a pattern of certain
                    bacteria that were only found in diseased brains. However,
                    this study has yet to be peer-reviewed and published in a
                    scientific journal, so the results should be treated with
                    some caution.

                    Change history: Google apparently keeps a copy of every
                    version of every page it has ever indexed. Meaning, Google
                    can "remember" every change ever made to a page. However,
                    Google only uses the last 20 changes of a URL when analyzing
                    links.

                Three years ago, Subaru, Mazda, Toyota, Kawasaki, and Yamaha
                announced a joint development scheme for combustion engines
                based on alternatives to conventional fossil fuels i.e.
                synthetic fuels, biofuels and liquid hydrogen. Last Monday, May
                28, Toyota, Subaru and Mazda unveiled the first results of that
                cooperation, a set of new ICE engines to go into production from
                2026.
              </p>
              <p>From the press blurb:</p>

                <div>
                  <p>
                    With the next generation of engines, the three companies
                    will seek to not only improve standalone engine performance
                    but also optimize their integration with electric drive
                    units, harnessing the advantages of each.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While being highly efficient and powerful, the new engines
                    will also revolutionize vehicle packaging by being more
                    compact than existing models. Smaller engines will allow for
                    even lower hoods, improving design possibilities and
                    aerodynamic performance while contributing to better fuel
                    efficiency. The development will also emphasize compliance
                    with increasingly strict emissions regulations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the same time, the new engines will be made carbon
                    neutral by shifting away from fossil fuels and offering
                    compatibility with various alternatives, including e-fuel
                    (synthetic fuel), biofuels, and liquid hydrogen. In doing
                    so, these engines will contribute to the broader adoption of
                    CN fuels.

                    and GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards. For extra measure,
                    Gigabyte has implemented what the brand calls the "PCIe UD
                    Slot X" in some of its high-end Intel and AMD motherboards.

                    [...] While the PCIe UD Slot X feature isn't novel, this is
                    the first time we've been given a specific metric of the
                    maximum weight it can withstand. One trend we've seen is
                    that graphics cards are becoming larger and more
                    power-hungry. The transition from the

                    early whispers that the forthcoming

                    (Blackwell) likely won't be any slimmer, 128 pounds is
                    overkill.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, the initial PCB cracking was caused by the design
                    of the cutout, which didn't mitigate the weight of the
                    graphics card. So, while Gigabyte's PCIe UD Slot X supports
                    up to 128 pounds, it still won't impede PCB cracking because
                    the problem lies in the graphics card and not the expansion
                    slot. There weren't any reports of the expansion slot
                    breaking. It was always about the graphics card's warping or
                    the PCB cracking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps the 128 pounds refers to impact load, which would
                    make sense. A more sturdy expansion slot will help with
                    shipping and transportation, especially in the case of
                    pre-built machines. But then again, if the fall is high
                    enough, it won't matter if the expansion slot can
                    accommodate up to 500 pounds because the graphics card would
                    probably break. In a situation like this, many would prefer
                    that the expansion slot come off the motherboard rather than
                    fracturing the graphics card, which, in most cases, is the
                    more expensive hardware.

                    multinationals, they have often fought back in the courts.
                    In Mexico, companies including Kellogg's and Nestlé have
                    sued the government over the introduction of
                    front-of-package warning labels and other restrictions
                    including the use of children's characters in marketing.

                    The labels—black octagons that warn about excess of sugars,
                    sodium, trans fat, saturated fat, and calories in
                    products—were rolled out in 2020. A handful of the lawsuits
                    were accepted by the Mexican Supreme Court and are still

                    Nestlé said it "supported front-of-pack labeling that helps

                    government-endorsed labels such as Nutri-Score in some
                    European countries or the traffic light system in the UK.

                    have gained new insight on galaxies forming during an
                    earlier period of the universe.

                  <p>
                    These three galaxies are believed to be actively forming
                    when the universe was only 400m to 600m years old – compared
                    to the universe’s current estimated age of roughly 13.7bn
                    years. Thanks to Webb’s powerful instruments, researchers
                    can peer into this early period and learn more about how the
                    universe was formed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Webb’s data on this early period shows these three galaxies
                    are surrounded by gases. The researchers suspect these gases
                    are almost purely hydrogen and helium, the earliest elements
                    to exist in the cosmos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “We’re moving away from a picture of galaxies as
                    isolated ecosystems,” Nielsen said. “At this stage in the
                    history of the universe, galaxies are all intimately
                    connected to the intergalactic medium with its filaments and
                    structures of pristine gas.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] By combining spectra with Webb images, the team found
                    that the light from these three forming galaxies is being
                    absorbed by large amounts of neutral hydrogen gas.

                  <p>
                    “The gas must be very widespread and cover a very large
                    fraction of the galaxy,” said study co-author and associate
                    professor Darach Watson. “This suggests that we are seeing
                    the assembly of neutral hydrogen gas into galaxies. That gas
                    will go on to cool, clump, and form new stars.”

                    By matching James Webb’s data to existing models of star
                    formation, the researchers also found that these galaxies
                    primarily have populations of young stars, suggesting these
                    galaxies have not had enough time to form most of their
                    stars yet.

                    Nvidia's argument likely depends on the court agreeing that
                    AI models ingesting published works in order to transform
                    those works into weights governing AI outputs is fair use.

                    Some companies, like OpenAI, have already started licensing

                    that "publishers should be paid when their work is used for

                    Until this question is settled by courts or lawmakers,
                    companies training AI on the Books3 dataset will likely
                    continue to face lawsuits from rights holders, particularly
                    from those who see AI models as an extension of harms caused

                    Authors suing Nvidia have taken the next step, linking the
                    chipmaker to shadow libraries by arguing that "these shadow
                    libraries have long been of interest to the AI-training
                    community because they host and distribute vast quantities
                    of unlicensed copyrighted material. For that reason, these
                    shadow libraries also violate the US Copyright Act."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Nvidia apparently prepares to defend against copyright
                    suits by disputing what a shadow library even is, the
                    websites at the heart of Nvidia's suits may take less issue
                    with the label. Anna, the pseudonymous creator of Anna's
                    Archive, freely uses the term,
                    <a href="https://annas-blog.org/">describing</a> the site as
                    "the world's largest shadow library" while offering to train
                    other so-called pirate archivists.

                    After years of promising legislation against Big Tech firms
                    such as Apple, the UK has now sped up the process to get

                    However, also in 2023, the finally active Digital Markets
                    Unit (DMU) did get going with a Digital Markets, Competition
                    and Consumers Bill. While its stated purpose is to lead to
                    establishing codes of conduct for Big Tech firms, it's a
                    step toward emulating the existing Digital Markets Act in

                    The bill was, though, just one of very many legislative
                    bills making their way through the UK parliamentary system —
                    until this week. On May 22, 2024, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak
                    called for a General Election, and that immediately changed
                    proceedings.

                    [...] Bills cannot be carried over from one Parliament to
                    another, so the UK has been picking which it will rush
                    through, and which it will abandon. Consequently, on May 23,
                    Parliament debated and passed the bill.

                    Four zebrafish are alive and well after nearly a month in
                    space aboard China's Tiangong space station. As part of an
                    experiment testing the development of vertebrates in
                    microgravity, the fish live and swim within a small habitat

                  <p>
                    While the zebrafish have thus far survived, they are showing
                    some signs of disorientation. The taikonauts aboard
                    Tiangong—Ye Guangfu, Li Cong, and Li Guangsu—have reported
                    instances of swimming upside down, backward, and in circular
                    motions, suggesting that microgravity is having an effect on
                    their spatial awareness.

                  <p>
                    The zebrafish were launched aboard Shenzhou-18, which
                    carried them, as well as a batch of hornwort, to orbit on
                    April 25, 2024. The aim of the project is to create a
                    self-sustaining ecosystem, studying the effects of both
                    microgravity and radiation on the development and growth of
                    these species.

                    [...] The zebrafish genome has been fully sequenced, and for
                    these reasons zebrafish are commonly used in scientific
                    experiments on Earth. Seeing how these well-studied
                    creatures behave in such an extreme environment may have a
                    lot to tell us about the life and development of vertebrates
                    across species while exposed to microgravity.

                    [...] This is not the first time fish have been to space.
                    Starting in 2012, a Japanese research project brought medaka
                    and zebrafish to the International Space Station for study
                    in a similar aquatic habitat. The results of those studies
                    revealed a decrease in bone density in the fish within just
                    ten days. Human astronauts experience similar effects in
                    orbit, though not on such quick time scales, and they can be
                    mitigated somewhat through rigorous exercise routines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The health and sustainability of animal life in space
                    is a key area of research for human spaceflight efforts. If
                    humans are to travel on long-term space missions, like those
                    required to reach Mars, then understanding the biological
                    implications of space travel is vital. These zebrafish are
                    the latest in a long line of experiments undertaken in this
                    pressing area of research.

                    But one of these Russian satellites, Kosmos 2542, released a
                    smaller sub-satellite, designated Kosmos 2543, which made
                    its own passes near the USA 245 spacecraft, a KH-11 imaging
                    satellite similar to USA 314. At one point, satellite
                    trackers noticed USA 245 made a slight change to orbit. Its
                    Russian pursuer later made a similar orbit adjustment to
                    keep up.

                    In 2020, Kosmos 2543 backed off from USA 245. Once well away
                    from the NRO satellite, Kosmos 2543 ejected a mysterious
                    projectile into space at a speed fast enough to damage any
                    target in its sights.

                    velocity of some 400 mph (700 km per hour), according to

                    The dent got his attention the most. He ran his finger
                    across this damaged area to see if it was indeed a dent or
                    perhaps some kind of residue. As he was rubbing the damaged
                    area of the panel, he felt a sudden sharp pain and jerked
                    his hand away. Due to the angle of his arm, he apparently
                    slit his wrist open on the extremely sharp corner where the
                    side panels and the tailgate meet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Initially, he thought this was just a superficial cut. So
                    did the Tesla employees who joked, "This thing can be
                    dangerous!" Then they noticed the blood pooling on the
                    ground below him. The service team rushed to get a first aid
                    kit, with which they disinfected and bandaged his wound.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite this rather disastrous delivery, bdesign did
                    finalize the paperwork and take the truck home. But by the
                    end of the day, his wound still hadn't begun to close. So he
                    spent the evening in the emergency room.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunately, 'bdesign' isn't the first owner to get a gash
                    from the Cybertruck. Earlier this month, another owner
                    <a

                      >cut themselves on the door's edge</a
                    > when exiting the vehicle. Of course, this type of door
                    injury is not unheard of. For instance, a
                    <a

                    to them on more than one occasion. A Rivian owner injured
                    themselves in a similar manner,
                    <a

                    But the unusually sharp corners of the Cybertruck's exterior
                    and could prove dangerous to both owners and pedestrians.
                    This is a concern that automotive reviewers, safety
                    experts and owners have been pointing out for months. We
                    even saw this as far back as December, when
                    <a
                      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6WDq0V5oBg&amp;t=1194s"

                    on the edge of the vehicle's hood.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So this is not a one-off occurrence. Hopefully, it will not
                    become more common as more trucks hit the streets, and we
                    hope 'bdesign' has an easier time with his truck from now
                    on.

                    Transparent wood, made by infusing polymers into wood, shows
                    promise but is hindered by limited availability of wood in
                    China and fire risks associated with its use. This study
                    explores the potential of utilizing bamboo, which has a
                    shorter growth cycle, as a valuable resource for developing
                    flame-retardant, smoke-suppressing, and superhydrophobic
                    transparent bamboo. A 3-layered flame-retardant barrier,
                    composed of a top silane layer, an intermediate layer of
                    SiO2 formed through hydrolysis-condensation of Na2SiO3 on
                    the surface, and an inner layer of Na2SiO3, has been
                    confirmed to be effective in reducing heat release, slowing
                    flame spread, and inhibiting the release of combustible
                    volatiles, toxic smoke, and CO.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Compared to natural bamboo and other congeneric transparent
                    products, the transparent bamboo displays remarkable
                    superiority, with the majority of parameters being notably
                    lower by an entire order of magnitude.

                    It achieves a long ignition time of 116 s, low total heat
                    release (0.7 MJ/m2), low total smoke production (0.063 m2),
                    and low peak CO concentration (0.008 kg/kg). Moreover, when
                    used as a substrate for perovskite solar cells, the
                    transparent bamboo displays the potential to act as a light
                    management layer, leading to a marked efficiency enhancement
                    of 15.29%. The excellent features of transparent bamboo make
                    it an enticing choice for future advancements in
                    flame-retardant glasses and optical devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bamboo, often referred to as "the second forest", boasts a
                    rapid growth and regeneration rate, allowing it to reach
                    maturity and be utilized as a building material within 4 to
                    7 years of growth. With an output 4 times higher than wood
                    per acre, bamboo is recognized for its exceptional
                    efficiency. In terms of chemical composition, bamboo shares
                    similarities with wood, mainly consisting of lignin,
                    cellulose, and hemicellulose. Furthermore, the internal
                    hierarchical structure of bamboo closely resembles that of
                    wood, featuring high porosity and permeability because of
                    neatly arranged vertical channels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This characteristic suggests the potential use of bamboo in
                    the production of transparent composite materials.
                    Transparent bamboo offers 3 distinct advantages over
                    traditional silica glass. Firstly, the abundant and
                    renewable nature of bamboo feedstock aligns with
                    environmental sustainability goals. Secondly, transparent
                    bamboo exhibits high light transmittance and haze, enabling
                    privacy while facilitating the entry of natural light
                    indoors. Lastly, the low density and excellent ability to
                    regulate temperature and humidity from a bamboo template
                    further position it as a promising alternative to
                    conventional glass.

                    The competition to produce the world's most advanced chips
                    is fierce, and TSMC's product roadmap promises that the
                    battle for supremacy will be intense. First, its
                    performance-optimized N3P node is coming, set to enter mass
                    production in the second half of 2024 and will be the
                    company's most advanced node for a while.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next year, however, TSMC will introduce two production nodes
                    that will enter high-volume manufacturing in the second half
                    of 2025, promising to accelerate the advantages of N3P.
                    These nodes are N3X, a 3nm-class process, and N2, a
                    2nm-class process.
                  </p>

                    compiled by AnandTech, N3X chips can either reduce power
                    consumption by 7% by lowering Vdd from 1.0V to 0.9V,
                    increase performance by 5%, or increase transistor density
                    by around 10%.

                    exceptional low Vdd performance that is designed for mobile

                    stacked nanosheets deliver a new level of energy efficient
                    computing for HPC, TSMC says. Backside power rail will also
                    be added to boost performance even further.

                  <p>
                    N2 technology will come with TSMC NanoFlex, a
                    design-technology co-optimization that provides designers
                    with flexibility in N2 standard cells, with short cells
                    emphasizing small area and greater power efficiency, and
                    tall cells maximizing performance. Customers are able to
                    optimize the combination of short and tall cells within the
                    same design block.

                  <p>
                    In 2026, TSMC will introduce two more nodes: N2P (2nm-class)
                    and A16 (1.6nm-class).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    N2P is expected to deliver a 5% - 10% lower power or a 5% -
                    10% higher performance compared to the original N2. However,
                    contrary to prior announcements, N2P

                    Kodak and Polaroid, the two most famous camera companies of
                    the 20th century, had a great partnership for 20+ years.
                    Then in an inexplicable turnabout Kodak decided to destroy

                    More than 190 nations agreed Friday on a new treaty to
                    combat so-called biopiracy and regulate patents stemming
                    from genetic resources such as medicinal plants,
                    particularly ones whose uses owe a debt to traditional
                    knowledge.

                    After lengthy negotiations, delegates approved to cheers and
                    applause the "first WIPO Treaty to address the interface
                    between intellectual property, genetic resources and
                    traditional knowledge", the UN's World Intellectual Property
                    Organization said in a statement.

                    [...] Genetic resources are increasingly used by companies
                    in everything from cosmetics to seeds, medicines,

                    They have enabled considerable progress in health, climate
                    and food security, according to the United Nations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The treaty text says patent applicants will be
                    required to disclose where the genetic resources used in an
                    invention came from, and the indigenous people who provided
                    the associated traditional knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The goal is to combat biopiracy by ensuring that an
                    invention is genuinely new, and that the countries and local
                    communities concerned agree with the use of their genetic
                    resources, such as plant species cultivated over time, and
                    the traditional knowledge surrounding them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While natural genetic resources—such as those found in
                    medicinal plants, agricultural crops and animal
                    breeds—cannot be directly protected as intellectual
                    property, inventions developed using them can be patented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As it is currently not mandatory to publish the origin of
                    innovations, many developing countries are concerned that
                    patents are being granted that circumvent the rights of
                    indigenous people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Antony Scott Taubman set up WIPO's traditional knowledge
                    division in 2001 but no longer works with the agency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I wouldn't go so far as to say it's revolutionary," he said
                    of the treaty.

                    Brazilian ambassador Guilherme de Aguiar Patriota, who has

                    PBMD (Plant-Based Meat Diet) on cardiometabolic health

                    that the group on ABMD had better glycaemic control.

                    that a version of the JAVS Viewer 8 available for download
                    on javs.com contained a backdoor that gave an unknown threat
                    actor persistent access to infected devices. The malicious
                    download, planted inside an executable file that installs
                    the JAVS Viewer version 8.3.7, was available no later than

                    on X (formerly Twitter) reported it. It’s unclear when the
                    backdoored version was removed from the company’s download
                    page. JAVS representatives didn’t immediately respond to
                    questions sent by email.

                    “Users who have version 8.3.7 of the JAVS Viewer executable
                    installed are at high risk and should take immediate
                    action,” Rapid7 researchers Ipek Solak, Thomas Elkins, Evan
                    McCann, Matthew Smith, Jake McMahon, Tyler McGraw, Ryan
                    Emmons, Stephen Fewer, and John Fenninger wrote. “This
                    version contains a backdoored installer that allows
                    attackers to gain full control of affected systems.”

                    The installer file was titled JAVS Viewer Setup
                    8.3.7.250-1.exe. When executed, it copied the binary file
                    fffmpeg.exe to the file path C:\Program Files
                    (x86)\JAVS\Viewer 8\. To bypass security warnings, the
                    installer was digitally signed, but with a signature issued
                    to an entity called “Vanguard Tech Limited” rather than to
                    “Justice AV Solutions Inc.,” the signing entity used to
                    authenticate legitimate JAVS software.

                    The researchers said fffmpeg.exe also downloaded the file

                    chrome_installer.exe went on to execute a binary and several

                    A five-year-old boy who was born without a left hand has
                    become the youngest in the world to get a bionic Hero Arm,
                    making him "feel like a superhero".

                  <p>
                    The custom-made, 3D printed prosthetic is produced by
                    Bristol-based Open Bionics, which was founded in 2014 and
                    launched four clinics in America in the last year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jordan, of Long Island, New York state, is now the youngest
                    ever owner of one of the firm's Hero Arms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The prosthetic uses special sensors which detect muscular
                    contractions and turn them into bionic hand movements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most children with Hero Arms are aged seven years old or
                    above, but the firm said Jordan's size for his age and his
                    high IQ – meaning he was easy to teach how to use the Hero

                    Both generative and operational AI "generate new work,"
                    Cappelli pointed out. "People have to manage databases, they
                    have to organize materials, they have to resolve these
                    problems of dueling reports, validity, and those sorts of
                    things. It's going to generate a lot of new tasks, somebody
                    is going to have to do those."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said operational AI that's been in place for some time is
                    still a work in progress. "Machine learning with numbers has
                    been markedly underused. Some part of this has been database
                    management questions. It takes a lot of effort just to put
                    the data together so you can analyze it. Data is often in
                    different silos in different organizations, which are
                    politically difficult and just technically difficult to put
                    together."  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cappelli cites several issues in the move toward generative
                    AI and LLMs that must be overcome:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cappelli suggested the most useful generative AI application
                    in the near term is sifting through data stores and
                    delivering analysis to support decision-making processes.
                    "We are washing data right now that we haven't been able to
                    analyze ourselves," he said. "It's going to be way better at
                    doing that than we are," he said. Along with database
                    management, "somebody's got to worry about guardrails and
                    data pollution issues."

                    "Like the papillae on a lotus leaf, micropillars do more
                    than decorate the surface," said Cheng. "They give the
                    surface new properties."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The micropillars designed by Cheng's team are 0.08
                    millimeters tall, roughly the same as the width of a human
                    hair. They are arranged in a regular pattern of 0.12
                    millimeters apart. A droplet of water encompasses 100 or
                    more of them. These tiny pillars press into a water droplet,
                    releasing heat into the interior of the droplet and making
                    it boil more quickly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Compared to the traditional view that the Leidenfrost effect
                    triggers at 230 degrees Celsius, the fin-array-like
                    micropillars press more heat into the water than a flat
                    surface. This causes microdroplets to levitate and jump off
                    the surface within milliseconds at lower temperatures
                    because the speed of boiling can be controlled by changing
                    the height of the pillars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the textured surface was heated, the team discovered
                    that the temperature at which the floating effect was
                    achieved was significantly lower than that of a flat
                    surface, starting at 130 degrees Celsius.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not only is this a novel discovery for the understanding of
                    the Leidenfrost effect, it is a twist on the limits
                    previously imagined. A
                    <a
                      href="https://phys.org/news/2021-09-unveils-minimum-temperature-droplets-levitating.html"
                      >2021 study</a
                    >
                    from Emory University found that the properties of water
                    actually caused the Leidenfrost effect to fail when the
                    temperature of the heated surface lowers to 140 degrees.
                    Using the micropillars created by Cheng's team, the effect
                    is sustainable even 10 degrees below that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We thought the micropillars would change the behaviors of
                    this well-known phenomenon, but our results defied even our
                    own imaginations," said Cheng. "The observed bubble-droplet
                    interactions are a big discovery for boiling heat transfer."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Leidenfrost effect is more than an intriguing phenomenon
                    to watch, it is also a critical point in heat transfer. When
                    water boils, it is most efficiently removing heat from a
                    surface. In applications such as machine cooling, this means
                    that adapting a hot surface to the textured approach
                    presented by Cheng's team gets heat out more quickly,
                    lowering the possibility of damage caused when a machine
                    gets too hot.

                    "Our research can prevent disasters such as vapor
                    explosions, which pose significant threats to industrial
                    heat transfer equipment," said Huang. "Vapor explosions
                    occur when vapor bubbles within a liquid rapidly expand due
                    to the present of intense heat source nearby. One example of
                    where this risk is particularly pertinent is in nuclear
                    plants, where the surface structure of heat exchangers can
                    influence vapor bubble growth and potentially trigger such
                    explosions. Through our theoretical exploration in the
                    paper, we investigate how surface structure affects the
                    growth mode of vapor bubbles, providing valuable insights
                    into controlling and mitigating the risk of vapor
                    explosions."

                Another day and Elon wants to do something new. Now he is going
                to build the worlds largest supercomputer, ready next fall
                (2025). His AI company is going to be the main customer, but I
                guess his other ventures from cars to rockets could use some
                computational power to.
              </p>
              <p>
                So he is apparently just not going to be bigger then the rest.
                He is going to build it massively bigger. As in at least four
                times bigger then then the top computers today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Renting supercomputing powers from other companies have
                apparently now become so expensive that it's cheaper and better
                to just build your own. A Gigafactory of Compute.
              </p>
              <p>
                The previous one for Tesla, the Tesla Dojo, was apparently not
                enough.

                    pockets to compete with OpenAI, Google or Meta on AI.

                    His company xAI is developing a chatbot named Grok, which
                    can access social media platform X, also owned by Musk, in
                    real time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Earlier this year, Musk said training the Grok 2 model took
                    about 20,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, adding that the Grok 3 model
                    and beyond would require 100,000 Nvidia H100 units.

                    In related news, Tesla shareholders are being urged by a
                    major proxy advisory firm to reject a proposed US$56 billion
                    pay package for Musk, in a blow to the electric-vehicle
                    manufacturer's board.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Glass Lewis &amp; Co made its recommendation in a report
                    released on Saturday, citing the "excessive size" of the pay
                    deal and the dilutive effect upon exercise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Mr. Musk's slate of extraordinarily time-consuming projects
                    unrelated to the company was well-documented before the 2018
                    grant, and only expanded with his high-profile purchase of
                    the company now known as X," Glass Lewis said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The recommendation to large institutional investors might
                    sway their vote over Musk's pay at the vehicle
                    manufacturer's annual meeting on June 13. If the proposal is
                    rejected, the CEO might make good on threats to develop
                    products outside of Tesla.

                    And, I mean, when compared to link taxes, it is potentially
                    marginally better (but also, with some very scary potential
                    side effects). The always thoughtful Brandon Silverman (who
                    created CrowdTangle and has worked to increase transparency
                    from tech companies) also endorses the bill as “<a
                      href="https://brandonsilverman.substack.com/p/a-potential-path-forward-between"

                    >.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But I tend to agree much more with journalism professor Jeff
                    Jarvis who highlights
                    <a
                      href="https://medium.com/whither-news/news-legislation-from-bad-to-worse-c32d9fc34670"

                    and the framework it creates. As I’ve pointed out with link
                    taxes, the oft-ignored point of a tax on something is to get
                    less of it. You tax something bad because that tax decreases
                    how much of it is out there. And, as Jarvis points out here,
                    this is basically a tax on information:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, Jarvis rightly points out that Glazer’s bill is
                    positioned as something unique when users give their
                    attention to internet companies, but explicitly carves out
                    when users give their attention to other types of media
                    companies. This sets up a problematically tiered system for
                    when attention gets taxed and when it doesn’t:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Indeed, the entire framing of the bill seems to suggest that
                    data and advertising is a sort of “pollution,” that needs to
                    be taxed in order to minimize it. And that seems
                    particularly troublesome.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As Jarvis also notes, the true beneficiaries of a law like
                    this would still be those rapacious hedge funds that have
                    bought up a bunch of news orgs [...]

                  <p>
                    The method, which the researchers say is "an absolute
                    miracle," <sub>[are we taken as savages here?]</sub> uses
                    the electrically-powered arc furnaces used for steel
                    recycling to simultaneously recycle cement, the
                    carbon-hungry component of concrete.<br />...<br />The
                    Cambridge researchers found that used cement is an effective
                    substitute for lime flux, which is used in steel recycling
                    to remove impurities and normally ends up as a waste product
                    known as slag. But by replacing lime with used cement, the
                    end product is recycled cement that can be used to make new
                    concrete.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cement recycling method developed by the Cambridge
                    researchers, reported in the journal Nature, does not add
                    any significant costs to concrete or steel production and
                    significantly reduces emissions from both concrete and
                    steel, due to the reduced need for lime flux.<br />...<br />Recent
                    tests carried out by the Materials Processing Institute, a
                    partner in the project, showed that recycled cement can be
                    produced at scale in an electric arc furnace (EAF), the
                    first time this has been achieved. Eventually, this method
                    could produce zero emission cement, if the EAF was powered
                    by renewable energy.<br />...<br />"I had a vague idea from
                    previous work that if it were possible to crush old
                    concrete, taking out the sand and stones, heating the cement
                    would remove the water, and then it would form clinker
                    again," said first author Dr Cyrille Dunant, also from the
                    Department of Engineering. "A bath of liquid metal would
                    help this chemical reaction along, and an electric arc
                    furnace, used to recycle steel, felt like a strong
                    possibility. We had to try."<br />...<br />"We found the
                    combination of cement clinker and iron oxide is an excellent
                    steelmaking slag because it foams and it flows well," said
                    Dunant. "And if you get the balance right and cool the slag
                    quickly enough, you end up with reactivated cement, without
                    adding any cost to the steelmaking process."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cement made through this recycling process contains
                    higher levels of iron oxide than conventional cement, but
                    the researchers say this has little effect on performance.

                    ARM efforts, thanks to the Raspberry Pi and single-board

                    far from done, as there's still a lot of development work

                    Qualcomm prides itself on its Linux enablement work and has
                    prioritized Linux enablement in all of its previous
                    Snapdragon laptop CPUs, typically announcing Linux support
                    one or two days after launch. The Snapdragon X Elite
                    continues that pattern, with Linux enablement being
                    announced the very next day after its original October 23,
                    2023 debut.

                It seems that the Asahi Linux project has also done great work
                on the M-series chips despite Apple. There, Apple still has to
                get up to speed.

                    municipalities build broadband networks, but only if no
                    private providers offer service or will offer service "in

                    [...] President Yoon raised many solid points. The United
                    States and European Union have thrown tens of billions of
                    dollars and euros respectively at IC manufacturers, while
                    South Korea's chip champs – Samsung Electronics and SK hynix
                    – are indeed monsters of memory as they collectively hold
                    over 70 percent of the market for DRAM and NAND flash. But
                    beyond Samsung's modest Exynos SoC operation (which can't
                    even satisfy demand for its own Galaxy smartphones), South
                    Korea is not home to a notable manufacturer of high-value
                    processors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Samsung and SK hynix have also made enormous bets on
                    factories to produce more memory – some on the peninsula and
                    others stateside (where they could attract funds from Uncle
                    Sam).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    South Korea's new funding package is tiny compared to the
                    sums its chip champions are spending, so it's unlikely it
                    will divert their efforts notably. Nor will it deter them
                    continuing to target the so-hot-right-now memory market, in
                    which demand for DDR5 and related variants – plus high
                    bandwidth memory (HBM) – is currently rampant. Indeed, SK
                    hynix has already found buyers for all the HBM it can make
                    in 2024 and most of the chips it will produce in 2025.

                    Trichinellosis occurs when people inadvertently consume
                    larvae of a roundworm in the <em>Trichinella</em> genus. The
                    worm commonly infects bears, wild boars, wildcats, foxes,
                    wolves, seals and walruses. People typically become infected
                    after consuming raw or undercooked meat from infected
                    animals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Historically, people in the U.S. sometimes contracted the
                    infection from raw or undercooked commercial pork products,
                    but modern regulations and cooking guidelines have lowered
                    this risk.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The newly reported case took place in 2022, when a
                    29-year-old man in Minnesota was hospitalized with a fever,
                    severe muscle aches and pains and swelling around the eyes.
                    He was also found to have a high number of immune cells
                    called eosinophilia, a sign of infection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Within a span of about half a month, the man had sought
                    medical attention for his symptoms four times and was
                    hospitalized twice. During the second hospitalization, he
                    reported having consumed bear meat, and the medical team
                    started him on medication for parasitic worms, just in case.
                    They later confirmed he was carrying antibodies against
                    <em>Trichinella</em> worms, and an investigation was
                    launched to check for more cases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    About a week before he got sick, the Minnesota man had met
                    up with nine family members in South Dakota. They'd shared a
                    meal that included kabobs made with black bear (<em
                      >Ursus americanus</em
                    >) meat, which was originally harvested in Canada by one of
                    the attending family members. It had been frozen for 45 days
                    before being thawed, cooked and served with vegetables.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The hunting outfitter had recommended freezing the meat to
                    kill parasites," the CDC report notes. But some
                    <em>Trichinella</em> species can survive being frozen. (This
                    includes <em>Trichinella</em><em>nativa</em>, which turned
                    out to be the species likely involved in this case.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The meat was initially inadvertently served rare,
                    reportedly because the meat was dark in color, and it was
                    difficult for the family members to visually ascertain the
                    level of doneness," the report noted. Some family members
                    noticed the meat was underdone while eating it, and it was
                    then cooked a bit more before being served again.

                    Proteins linked to cancer can start appearing in people's
                    blood more than seven years before they're diagnosed, our
                    funded researchers have found. In the future, it's possible
                    doctors could use these early warning signs to find and
                    treat cancer much earlier than they're able to today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Across two studies, researchers at
                    <a href="https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/"
                      >Oxford Population Health</a
                    >
                    identified 618 proteins linked to 19 different types of
                    cancer, including 107 proteins in a group of people whose
                    blood was collected at least seven years before they were
                    diagnosed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings suggest that these proteins could be involved
                    at the very earliest stages of cancer. Intercepting them
                    could give us a way to stop the disease developing
                    altogether.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This research brings us closer to being able to prevent
                    cancer with targeted drugs – once thought impossible but now
                    much more attainable," explained Dr Karl Smith-Byrne, Senior
                    Molecular Epidemiologist at Oxford Population Health, who
                    worked on both papers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For now, though, we need to do further research. The team
                    want to find out more about the roles these proteins play in
                    cancer development, how we can use tests to spot the most
                    important ones, and which drugs we can use to stop them
                    driving cancer.

                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48017-6"
                      >first study</a
                    >, scientists analysed 44,000 blood samples collected and
                    stored by UK Biobank, including over 4,900 samples from
                    people who were later diagnosed with cancer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their analysis of 1,463 proteins in each sample revealed 107
                    that changed at least seven years before a cancer diagnosis
                    and 182 that changed at least three years before a cancer
                    diagnosis.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    cancer cases to do a deep dive into which blood proteins
                    were involved in cancer development and could be targeted by
                    new treatments.

                  <p>
                    This time, they found 40 proteins in the blood that
                    influence someone's risk of getting nine different types of
                    cancer. While altering these proteins may increase or
                    decrease the chances of someone developing cancer, more
                    research is needed to make sure targeting them with drugs
                    doesn't cause unintended side effects.

                The BBC is running a podcast on "Archive on 4" called "Turning

                I remember greatly enjoying that book in the 1970s, made a real
                impression and it changed how I thought about certain things.
                This podcast was a great refresher. It even includes original
                interviews with Robert Persig (the author) and others close to
                the creation of the book.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the backstory behind the book was eye opening (but other
                parts were easy enough to work out just by reading it). For
                example, Persig flogged his original manuscript to many, many
                publishers before he got a nibble. Then he gives a lot of credit
                to a young editor who convinced him to change from (iirc) first
                to third person (via an unmamed observer) -- resulting in the
                eventual great success of the book.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, the podcast can't resist revisiting the oft-quoted
                beer can shim story...or am I confusing that with a recent post
                on a motorcycle maintenance forum (grin)?

                    The EU is concerned that Bing’s AI features could impact
                    elections, while the UK’s CMA has decided not to investigate
                    Microsoft’s partnership with Mistral AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The EU has Microsoft on its regulatory radar, as it has sent
                    the company a legally binding request for information about
                    Bing’s generative AI features.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The European Commission said this request for information is
                    based on suspicions that Bing may have breached the
                    <a

                    >
                    (DSA) due to risks linked to generative AI. These risks
                    include AI ‘hallucinations’, the viral spread of deepfakes
                    and the “automated manipulation of services that can mislead
                    voters”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Meanwhile, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority
                    (CMA) has opted to not investigate Microsoft’s partnership
                    with the start-up Mistral AI.

                    earlier this year as part of a “<a
                      href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/microsoft-mistral-ai-deal-large-language-model-openai-azure"
                      >multi-year partnership</a
                    >” to boost its Azure cloud computing platform with AI. But
                    the CMA had concerns around whether the agreements between
                    the two companies qualified as a merger deal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As part of that effort, the CMA looked into the minority
                    investment deals agreed by Microsoft and Mistral. The
                    regulator had concerns that the links between the two
                    companies could impact competition within the UK.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But in a brief statement released today (17 May), the CMA
                    decided that Microsoft’s partnership with Mistral AI “does
                    not qualify for investigation” under the merger provisions
                    in the UK.

                    The wreckage of a US Navy submarine that sank the most
                    Japanese warships during World War Two has been found in the
                    South China Sea, some 80 years after it was sunk by enemy
                    forces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The USS Harder was found 3,000ft (914m) below water off the
                    Philippines' northern island of Luzon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Harder was sunk in battle on 29 August 1944, along with
                    its crew of 79 men.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In one of its final war patrols, it sank three Japanese
                    destroyers and heavily damaged two others over four days,
                    according to the US Navy's History and Heritage Command
                    (NHHC).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This forced the Japanese to change their battle plans and
                    delay their carrier force, contributing to their defeat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Harder was lost in the course of victory. We must not
                    forget that victory has a price, as does freedom," said
                    Samuel J. Cox, a retired US admiral who heads the NHHC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Philippines was one of the main Pacific battlegrounds of
                    World War Two, as the US fought to retake its former colony
                    from the Japanese Imperial Army.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Waters in and around the archipelago have served as the
                    resting place of famed World War Two battleships.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Harder, which sailed under the motto of "Hit 'em
                    harder', was found by the Lost 52 project, which aims to
                    find the 52 US submarines lost during World War Two. It was
                    found sitting upright on its keel or spine, and relatively
                    intact, the US Navy said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The submarine and its crew were later awarded the
                    Presidential Unit Citation for its service during the war.
                    The honour recognises extraordinary heroism in action.

                , Microsoft is introducing a new "feature" in Windows 11:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    If you haven't read about it yet, Recall is an AI feature
                    coming to Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs. It's designed to let you
                    go back in time on your computer by "taking images of your
                    active screen every few seconds" and analyzing them with AI,
                    according to Microsoft's Recall FAQs. If anyone other than
                    you gets access to that Recall data, it could be disastrous.
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    On the surface, this sounds like a cool feature, but that
                    paranoid privacy purist in the back of my mind is burying
                    his face in a pillow and screaming. Imagine if almost
                    everything you had done for the past three months was
                    recorded for anyone with access to your computer to see.
                    Well, if you use Recall, you won't have to imagine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That might seem like an overreaction, but let me explain:
                    Recall is taking screenshots every few seconds and storing
                    them on your device. Adding encryption into the mix, that's
                    an enormous amount of bloaty visual data that will show
                    almost everything you've been doing on your computer during
                    that period.
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Microsoft openly
                    admits that Recall will be taking screenshots of your
                    passwords and private data:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Note that Recall does not perform content moderation. It
                    will not hide information such as passwords or financial
                    account numbers. That data may be in snapshots that are
                    stored on your device, especially when sites do not follow
                    standard internet protocols like cloaking password entry."
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    Arguably, the worst part about this is that it will be on by
                    default once you activate your device. Microsoft states:
                  </p>
                  <p>        On by default</p>
                </div>

                    collaborations with third parties. In particular, the
                    company said it would launch its all-new 256-core AmpereOne
                    processor next year, made on TSMC's N3 process technology.
                    Also, Ampere is teaming up with Qualcomm to build AI
                    inference servers with the company's accelerators.
                    Apparently, Huawei is also looking at integrating
                    third-party UCIe-compatible chiplets into its own platforms.

                  <p>
                    Ampere has begun shipping 192-core AmpereOne processors with
                    an eight-channel DDR5 memory subsystem it introduced a year
                    ago. Later this year, the company plans to introduce
                    192-core AmpereOne CPUs with a 12-channel DDR5 memory
                    subsystem, requiring a brand-new platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next year, the company will use this platform for its
                    256-core AmpereOne CPU, which will be made using one of
                    TSMC's N3 fabrication processes. The company does not
                    disclose whether the new processor will also feature a new
                    microarchitecture, though it looks like it will continue to
                    feature 2 MB of L2 cache per core.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are extending our product family to include a new
                    256-core product that delivers 40% more performance than any
                    other CPU in the market," said Renee James, chief executive
                    of Ampere. "It is not just about cores. It is about what you
                    can do with the platform. We have several new features that
                    enable efficient performance, memory, caching, and AI
                    compute." 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company says that its 256-core CPU will use the same
                    cooling system as its existing offerings, which implies that
                    its thermal design power will remain in the 350-watt
                    ballpark. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Ampere can certainly address many general-purpose
                    cloud instances, its capabilities for AI are fairly limited.
                    The company itself says that its 128-core AmpereOne CPU with
                    its two 128-bit vector units per core (and supporting INT8,
                    INT16, FP16, and BFloat16 formats) can offer performance
                    comparable to Nvidia's A10 GPU, albeit at lower power. [...]
                    So, it teamed up with Qualcomm, and the two companies plan
                    to build platforms for LLM inferencing based on Ampere's
                    CPUs and <a

                    its experimental brain-computer interface chip in a
                    paraplegic man, Noland Arbaugh, in an operation that was
                    publicly announced this past January. Arbaugh’s identity was
                    revealed during a
                    <a

                    in March, during which the patient demonstrated some of the
                    abilities the chip had given him, including the chance to
                    play computer chess with his mind. It was recently revealed,
                    however, that Arbaugh’s chip had malfunctioned and, for a
                    period of time, experienced data leakage.

                    The company has now received federal approval to continue
                    implanting patients with its chip, with the promise that it
                    will work out the kinks that caused problems with Arbaugh’s
                    chip, the Wall Street Journal
                    <a
                      href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/neuralink-gets-fda-green-light-for-second-patient-as-first-describes-his-emotional-journey-a2707584?st=03pf8lbwrq9rc3creflink=desktopwebshare_permalink"
                      >originally reported</a
                    >. Arbaugh’s chip malfunctioned because some of the tiny
                    wires attached to the chip came loose and stopped channeling
                    signals from his brain to the company’s servers. In its next
                    operation, Neuralink plans to embed these tiny wires deeper
                    into the next patient’s brain. A source told the newspaper
                    that the company wants to implant as many as 10 additional
                    people with its chip by the end of this year.

                  <p>
                    Arbaugh recently opened up about his experience with the
                    company in a series of press interviews. During a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-05-16/neuralink-s-first-patient-describes-living-with-brain-implant"
                      >conversation with Bloomberg</a
                    >, Arbaugh explained the disappointment he felt when the
                    chip began malfunctioning:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “I started losing control of the cursor. I thought they’d
                    made some changes and that was the reason...But then they
                    told me that the threads were getting pulled out of my
                    brain. At first, they didn’t know how serious it would be or
                    a ton about it...It was really hard to hear. I thought I’d
                    gotten to use it for maybe a month, and then my journey was
                    coming to an end. I thought they would just keep collecting
                    some data but that they were really going to move on to the
                    next person. I cried a little bit.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, Arbaugh says that updates to the chip’s software
                    have allowed him to regain many of the abilities that he
                    previously had and that he is still very supportive of
                    Neuralink and what it’s done for him.
