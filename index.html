              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Meta has unveiled a new AI tool, dubbed 'Voicebox', which it
                    claims represents a breakthrough in AI-powered speech
                    generation. However, the company won't be unleashing it on
                    the public just yet - because doing so could be disastrous.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Voicebox is currently able to produce audio clips of speech
                    in six languages (all of which are European of origin), and
                    - according to a
                    <a
                      href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/voicebox-generative-ai-model-speech/"
                      >blog post from Meta</a
                    >
                    - is the first AI model of its kind capable of completing
                    tasks beyond what it was 'specifically trained to
                    accomplish'. Meta claims that Voicebox handily outperforms
                    competing speech-generation AIs in virtually every area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So what exactly is it capable of? Well, for starters, it can
                    spew out reasonably accurate text-to-speech replications of
                    a person's voice using a sample audio file as short as two
                    seconds, a seemingly innocuous ability that holds a huge
                    amount of destructive potential in the wrong hands.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Meta clearly believes its new tool is good enough to
                    fool at least the majority of people [since] it's explicitly
                    not releasing Voicebox to the public, but instead publishing
                    a
                    <a
                      href="https://research.facebook.com/publications/voicebox-text-guided-multilingual-universal-speech-generation-at-scale/"
                      >research paper</a
                    >
                    and detailing a classifier tool that can identify
                    Voicebox-generated speech from real human speech. Meta
                    describes the classifier as "highly effective" - though
                    notably not perfectly effective.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A little caution, patience, and respect for the
                    magnitude of this technology is a welcome sight - although I
                    doubt Meta will sit on Voicebox for <em>too</em> long, since
                    the shareholders will no doubt be wondering how much money
                    it can make them...

                    Artificial intelligence-powered writing assistants that
                    autocomplete sentences or offer "smart replies" not only put
                    words into people's mouths, they also put ideas into their
                    heads, according to new research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Maurice Jakesch, a doctoral student in the field of
                    information science asked more than 1,500 participants to
                    write a paragraph answering the question, "Is social media
                    good for society?" People who used an AI writing assistant
                    that was biased for or against social media were twice as
                    likely to write a paragraph agreeing with the assistant, and
                    significantly more likely to say they held the same opinion,
                    compared with people who wrote without AI's help.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study suggests that the biases baked into AI writing
                    tools – whether intentional or unintentional – could have
                    concerning repercussions for culture and politics,
                    researchers said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We're rushing to implement these AI models in all walks of
                    life, but we need to better understand the implications,"
                    said co-author

                    "Apart from increasing efficiency and creativity, there
                    could be other consequences for individuals and also for our
                    society – shifts in language and opinions."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These technologies deserve more public discussion
                    regarding how they could be misused and how they should be
                    monitored and regulated, the researchers said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The more powerful these technologies become and the more
                    deeply we embed them in the social fabric of our societies,"
                    Jakesch said, "the more careful we might want to be about
                    how we're governing the values, priorities and opinions
                    built into them."

                    Since 2012, Kim Dotcom has been fighting extradition to the
                    United States where he faces serious charges related to
                    cloud storage site Megaupload. During that time, very little
                    has been said about Megaupload graphic designer, Julius
                    Bencko. A wanted man in the U.S., Bencko was arrested this
                    month by armed police in the Czech Republic, who filmed the
                    event and published it online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the United States government's superseding
                    indictment dated February 16, 2012, Julius Bencko is
                    described as a citizen and resident of Slovakia. A talented
                    graphic designer, Bencko was responsible for Megaupload's
                    logo and ensuring that other sites in the group looked good
                    and accommodated advertising properly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the United States government, this work earned
                    Bencko more than $1 million in 2010 alone. Even for the guy
                    responsible for integrating Megaupload's Flash player, that
                    was still pretty good money.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The important context here is that Bencko was the director
                    and sole shareholder of Basemax International Limited and
                    through that entity, he effectively held 2.5% of
                    Megaupload's shares. For someone who supposedly played a key
                    role in the most significant piracy conspiracy of all time,
                    the allegations against Bencko were underwhelming and, at
                    times, borderline comical.

                      >request for an injunction stopping that acquisition</a
                    >
                    heads toward opening arguments this week, the federal
                    regulator cites one piece of what it calls "powerful
                    evidence" that it can't trust Microsoft's assurances. In
                    short, as the FTC puts it, "Microsoft's actions following
                    its 2021 acquisition of ZeniMax speak louder than
                    Defendants' words."<br />[...]<br />Rather than focusing on
                    what it calls a "strained analogy" to ZeniMax, Microsoft
                    would prefer the court look at Microsoft's purchase of
                    Minecraft-maker Mojang, which has continued to publish the
                    game on a variety of platforms after becoming part of
                    Microsoft. This is a better analogy for Call of Duty,
                    Microsoft writes, because Minecraft was similarly "an
                    existing, multi-player, cross-platform franchise like
                    COD."<br />[...]<br />Call of Duty is unlike Minecraft, the
                    FTC argues, in part because Minecraft is available in
                    largely the same form on mobile phones, tablets, and the
                    Switch. "Even if Microsoft took Minecraft off of rival
                    consoles and subscription and cloud gaming services, it
                    would still be available for play on many other devices. The
                    context for Call of Duty is very different."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Regardless, the FTC also argues that this manufactured
                    categorization doesn't matter, because Microsoft's
                    exclusivity decision applied to "all future ZeniMax games."
                    While Microsoft
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/microsoft-confirms-some-new-bethesda-titles-will-be-exclusive-to-xbox-pc/"

                    no Bethesda non-exclusives have been announced since then.

                    For those unfamiliar, Secret Invasion is a Marvel Cinematic
                    Universe (MCU) series featuring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick
                    Fury. The storyline centers on a faction of shapeshifting
                    aliens called "Skrulls" that have infiltrated Earth,
                    prompting Fury and his former Skrull ally, Talos, to
                    respond. The plot explores the tension and distrust caused
                    by the Skrulls' shapeshifting abilities, which raises doubts
                    about everyone's real identities.

                    Because the particles in liquid metal tend to stay so close
                    together, it is difficult to get it to adhere to any surface
                    without something that acts as glue. But these adhesives
                    usually have a negative effect on the metal's properties,
                    such as its
                    <a

                    >. Yuan and his team wanted a liquid metal that could stick
                    to paper without an adhesive. They used an alloy of bismuth,
                    indium, and tin oxide (BiInSn) and tested how well it
                    performed next to an indium/gallium alloy (eGaIn).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    BiInSn turned out to be more effective. Unlike eGaIn, it
                    doesn't oxidize when exposed to air, so how well it sticks
                    to a surface does not depend on the oxide film that forms on
                    the metal. BiInSn is a solid at room temperature and has a
                    higher melting point, so there is no risk of it liquefying
                    at temperatures under 62° Celsius (about 144° Fahrenheit).
                    It is also capable of stronger adhesion. However, getting
                    optimal adhesion out of BiInSn required trial and error.

                    "We needed to ensure the adhesion of liquid metal to be
                    uniform in large scale on different paper, and to maintain
                    the stability of the coating," Yuan told Ars Technica in an
                    email interview. "To solve these problems, we changed
                    pressure applied on the stamp as well as the rubbing speed
                    used in the experiments and finally found the most suitable
                    parameters, which finally achieved fast, large-scale, and
                    stable adhesion."<br />[...]<br />This substance could

                    Since I discovered Video Chess for the Atari 2600, I found
                    it pretty impressive. However, I believed the game
                    implemented extra RAM memory, but more recently I discovered
                    it worked using only the 128 bytes of memory available, and
                    with a 4K ROM cartridge. That's an impressive achievement
                    for such a small game console, also the rumor of a bug
                    triggered me to reverse engineer this game to see how it
                    works.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Video Chess was developed by Larry Wagner and Bob Whitehead,
                    and released by Atari in 1979. Although the original game is
                    greater than 4K and a bank-switching PCB was created, the
                    final released game was optimized to use only a 4K ROM
                    cartridge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Video Chess also has the distinction of displaying eight
                    different objects on a screen row using a technique known as
                    <em>Venetian Blinds</em>, where the odd row of the screen
                    would show four chesspieces, and the even row of the screen
                    would show other four chesspieces. This technique allows the
                    Atari 2600 to exceed its own limit of 3 figures per screen
                    row. I won't discuss this technique as it is a video display
                    trick, and in this article I'll concentrate in the AI
                    (Artificial Intelligence) code.

                    in April. The site was the casualty of a round of layoffs at
                    Amazon that will affect a total of about 27,000 employees
                    this year; DPReview was meant to stop publishing new pieces
                    on April 10 and to be available in read-only mode for an
                    undetermined period of time after that.

                  <p>
                    But then, something odd happened: The site simply kept
                    publishing at a fairly regular clip throughout the entire
                    month of April and continuing until now. A no-update update

                    merely acknowledged that pieces were still going up and that
                    there was "nothing to share," which wasn't much to go on but
                    also didn't make it sound as though the site were in
                    imminent danger of disappearing.

                    This article was originally published primarily as a
                    response to IBM's Red Hat's change to no longer publish
                    complete, corresponding source (CCS) for RHEL and the prior
                    discontinuation of CentOS Linux (which are related events,
                    as described below). We hope that this will serve as a
                    comprehensive document that discusses the history of Red
                    Hat's RHEL business model, the related source code
                    provisioning, and the GPL compliance issues with RHEL.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For approximately twenty years, Red Hat (now a fully owned
                    subsidiary of IBM) has experimented with building a business
                    model for operating system deployment and distribution that
                    looks, feels, and acts like a proprietary one, but
                    nonetheless complies with the GPL and other standard
                    copyleft terms. Software rights activists, including SFC,
                    have spent decades talking to Red Hat and its attorneys
                    about how the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) business model
                    courts disaster and is actively unfriendly to
                    community-oriented Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
                    These pleadings, discussions, and encouragements have, as
                    far as we can tell, been heard and seriously listened to by
                    key members of Red Hat's legal and OSPO departments, and
                    even by key C-level executives, but they have ultimately
                    been rejected and ignored — sometimes even with a "fine,
                    then sue us for GPL violations" attitude. Activists have
                    found this discussion frustrating, but kept the nature and
                    tenure of these discussions as an "open secret" until now
                    because we all had hoped that Red Hat's behavior would
                    improve. Recent events show that the behavior has simply
                    gotten worse, and is likely to get even worse.

                Tech reporters don their sports reporting hats as Elon Musk and

                the two moguls banter and publicly agree to a fight in Vegas. It
                is to be seen if their agents will book the venue to make this a
                reality.<br /> <br />From The Verge:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    After Elon Musk recently tweeted that he would be "up for a
                    cage fight" with Zuckerberg, the Meta CEO shot back by
                    posting a screenshot of Musk's tweet with the caption "send
                    me location."<br /> <br />I've confirmed that Zuckerberg's
                    post on his Instagram account is, in fact, not a joke, which
                    means the ball is now in Musk's court. "The story speaks for
                    itself," Meta spokesperson Iska Saric told me.<br /> <br />After
                    this story was published, Musk responded with two words:
                    "Vegas Octagon." He then tweeted: "I have this great move
                    that I call 'The Walrus,' where I just lie on top of my
                    opponent and do nothing."<br />...<br />In terms of tech
                    billionaire CEOs literally fighting, Musk versus Zuckerberg
                    would be as good as it gets. Musk, 51, has the upper hand on
                    Zuckerberg in terms of sheer physical size, and he has
                    talked about being in "real hard-core street fights" when he
                    was growing up in South Africa. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg, 39,
                    is an aspirational MMA fighter who is already winning
                    Jiu-Jitsu tournaments. He also claims to have recently
                    completed the grueling "Murph Challenge" workout in just
                    under 40 minutes.<br /> <br />Regardless of who would win, I
                    think we can all agree that a Musk-versus-Zuckerberg match
                    would be one of the most entertaining fights of all time. It
                    needs to happen. Don't back down now, Musk.

              <p>
                 <br />As a tech enthusiast, I'm disappointed the battle will be
                resolved by elbows and fists rather than APIs and technical
                specs.

                    illegally buys and sells personal data. Mao told The
                    Intercept the ICE contract document, which she reviewed for
                    The Intercept, is "an admission and indication that ICE aims

                    rats. The team tested the electrodes' electrical and
                    mechanical performance in the animals for up to two months
                    and found the devices remained stable throughout, with
                    little inflammation or scarring to the surrounding tissues.
                    The electrodes also were able to relay electrical pulses
                    from the heart to an external monitor, as well as deliver
                    small pulses to the sciatic nerve and spinal cord, which in
                    turn stimulated motor activity in the associated muscles and

                  <p>
                    We all remember 2020. At the grocery store, toilet paper
                    shelves were empty. Cleaning supplies and disinfectants were
                    treasured finds. Rattled consumers, concerned that they
                    would run out of essential items, swiftly stockpiled
                    products until they disappeared from shelves. In the media,
                    it was referred to as "panic buying."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Disaster-related buying behaviors or DRBBs is a more
                    accurate phrase than panic buying," Holguin-Veras said.
                    "Panic refers to extreme fear that causes someone to act
                    irrationally, which negates the possibility to reason with
                    these individuals to change their purchasing behaviors."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198223000398"
                      >in research recently published</a
                    >, Holguín-Veras and team collected surveys in dozens of
                    countries and found that, in the U.S., the top three themes
                    were: precaution (25.79%), the anticipation of needs
                    (22.63%) to avoid the possibility of regret if they didn't
                    make the purchases (16.39%), and their interpretation of the
                    actions of others, or social cues (13.44%).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found that the key to altering consumer behavior to
                    maintain adequate supply levels is trusted change agents, or
                    TCAs. TCAs refer to the representatives of groups active in
                    disaster perceived to be knowledgeable and trustworthy such
                    as the Red Cross, national/state/local emergency responders,
                    firefighters, and national/state/local health officials,
                    that can reach large numbers of people, understand the need
                    to influence the individuals that enact "panic buying," and
                    are willing to act. A whopping 89% of people said that they
                    would limit their purchases if asked by a TCA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Peoples' objectives in DRBBs ran the gamut. First,
                    self-preservation was a primary concern. Second, altruism
                    factored in as consumers wanted to provide for their loved
                    ones and their communities. Third, opportunism reared its
                    head, as people tried to cash in on opportunities to sell
                    hard-to-find items at a premium. With this in mind, a
                    one-size-fits-all approach will not work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Managing DRBBs requires effective
                    public-private-humanitarian collaboration," said
                    Holguin-Veras. "The public sector has the legal authority to
                    intervene when needed, the private sector has control over
                    the access and supplies, and the humanitarian sector has the
                    deep community connections."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The sectors must work together in preparation, response, and
                    assessment. Building trust and relationships, monitoring
                    events and identifying situations that could prompt DRBBs,
                    and examining legal frameworks are priorities during the
                    preparation phase. During response, demand should be managed
                    by working with private- and humanitarian- sector
                    representatives, TCAs should be engaged, opportunistic
                    purchases should be controlled to foster equitable access,
                    and rationing should be instituted if needed. Appeals for
                    the donations of stockpiled supplies are another measure
                    that can be taken. Finally, a comprehensive assessment would
                    facilitate any needed improvements.

                    Sometimes life's most meaningful relationships grow from the
                    briefest of connections. Like when you go to a party and
                    meet someone wearing your favorite band's T-shirt, or who
                    laughs at the same jokes as you, or who grabs that unpopular
                    snack you alone (or so you thought) love. One small, shared
                    interest sparks a conversation—<em
                      >that's my favorite, too!</em
                    >—and blossoms into lasting affection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is called the similarity-attraction effect: we
                    generally like people who are like us. Now, new findings
                    from a Boston University researcher have uncovered one
                    reason why.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a series of studies, Charles Chu, a
                    <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/charles-chu/"
                      >BU Questrom School of Business assistant professor of
                      management and organizations</a
                    >, tested the conditions that shape whether we feel
                    attracted to—or turned off by—each other. He found one
                    crucial factor was what psychologists call self-essentialist
                    reasoning, where people imagine they have some deep inner
                    core or essence that shapes who they are. Chu discovered
                    that when someone believes an essence drives their
                    interests, likes, and dislikes, they assume it's the same
                    for others, too; if they find someone with one matching
                    interest, they reason that person will share their broader
                    worldview. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But Chu's research suggests this rush to embrace an
                    indefinable, fundamental similarity with someone because of
                    one or two shared interests may be based on flawed
                    thinking—and that it could restrict who we find a connection
                    with. Working alongside the pull of the
                    similarity-attraction effect is a countering push: we
                    dislike those who we don't think are like us, often because
                    of one small thing—they like <em>that</em> politician, or
                    band, or book, or TV show we loathe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are all so complex," says Chu. "But we only have full
                    insight into our <em>own</em> thoughts and feelings, and the
                    minds of others are often a mystery to us. What this work
                    suggests is that we often fill in the blanks of others'
                    minds with our own sense of self and that can sometimes lead
                    us into some unwarranted assumptions."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "When you hear a single fact or opinion being
                    expressed that you either agree or disagree with, it really
                    warrants taking an additional breath and just slowing down,"
                    he says. "Not necessarily taking that single piece of
                    information and extrapolating on it, using this type of
                    thinking to go to the very end, that this person is
                    fundamentally good and like me or fundamentally bad and not
                    like me."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But in a time when political division has invaded just
                    about every sphere of our lives,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/10/05/politics-bias-at-work-survey-shrm/"
                      >including workplaces</a
                    >, the applications of Chu's findings go way beyond
                    corporate horse trading. Managing staff, collaborating on
                    projects, team bonding—all are shaped by the judgments we
                    make about each other. Self-essentialist reasoning may even
                    influence society's distribution of resources, says Chu: who
                    we consider worthy of support, who gets funds and who
                    doesn't, could be driven by "this belief that people's
                    outcomes are caused by something deep inside of them."
                    That's why he advocates pushing pause before judging someone
                    who, at first blush, doesn't seem like you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There are ways for us to go through life and meet other
                    people, and form impressions of other people, without
                    constantly referencing ourselves," he says. "If we're
                    constantly going around trying to figure out, who's like me,
                    who's not like me?, that's not always the most productive
                    way of trying to form impressions of other people. People
                    are a lot more complex than we give them credit for."

                    An orca repeatedly rammed a yacht in the North Sea off
                    Shetland on Monday, in a concerning development following
                    previous interactions between the cetaceans and vessels in
                    the strait of Gibraltar and Portugal...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Experts believe this could be play among juvenile whales. Dr
                    Alfredo López, of the Grupo de Trabajo Orca Atlántica in
                    Portugal, said: "We know that many boats use fishing lines
                    from the stern to fish and it is a motivation for orcas,
                    they come to examine them." But the focus on boats' rudders
                    may come from adult whales who have developed an aversion
                    towards boats, perhaps because they "had a bad experience
                    and try to stop the boat so as not to repeat it".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most surprising is the fact that this learned behaviour
                    should have appeared nearly 3,000 miles (4,800km) from
                    Gibraltar. Dr Conor Ryan, a scientific adviser to the
                    Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, who has studied orca pods
                    off the Scottish coast, said: "I'd be reluctant to say it
                    cannot be learned from [the southern population]. It's
                    possible that this 'fad' is leapfrogging through the various
                    pods/communities."

                How long before "whale watching" tour boats have to harden their
                propulsion / steering systems to survive Orca attacks?

                    [...] To help get this community going, Intel will send
                    Tunnel Falls processors out to a few universities: The
                    Universities of Maryland, Rochester, Wisconsin, and Sandia
                    National Lab will be the first to receive the new chip, and
                    the company is interested in signing up others. The hope is
                    that researchers at these sites will help Intel characterize
                    sources of error and which forms of qubits provide the best
                    performance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using the chip, however, still requires hooking individual
                    chips up to a PCB and getting it down to near absolute zero
                    degrees in a dilution refrigeration system. This may
                    ultimately place a bottleneck on testing, given that Intel
                    can likely manufacture a lot more devices than it can
                    possibly put to use—another reason why shipping them to
                    others makes sense for the company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Overall, Intel has made a daring choice for its
                    quantum strategy. Electron-based qubits have been more
                    difficult to work with than many other technologies because
                    they tend to have shorter life spans before they decohere
                    and lose the information they should be holding. Intel is
                    counting on rapid iteration, a large manufacturing capacity,
                    and a large community to help it figure out how to overcome
                    this. But testing quantum computing chips and understanding
                    why their qubits sometimes go wrong is not an easy process;
                    it requires highly specialized refrigeration hardware that
                    takes roughly a day to get the chips down to a temperature
                    where they can be used.

                Apollo 13 lifted off a week or so after my eighteenth birthday.
                Of course, it had my attention, although not as much as when
                <a href="https://mcgrewbooks.com/RandomScribblings/1969.html"
                  >Apollo 11 landed</a
                >. Nobody else was much interested by then. At least, until
                everybody thought all the astronauts onboard were on their way
                to death.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I saw the movie <i>Apollo 13</i>, it seemed realistic.
                Nothing in the movie contradicted anything I remembered seeing
                in the newspaper or that Walter Cronkite said. I looked for this
                book in every library I had access to, unsuccessfully. Then I
                got the movie out again and decided to just buy the book a few
                weeks ago. I found a used hardcover copy on Amazon only a buck
                or two more expensive than the e-book.
              </p>
              <p>
                I didn't have to read far to realize that the movie wasn't
                nonfiction. It was "based on a true story" and its makers
                dishonestly advertised it as nonfiction. Much of the movie was
                made up out of whole cloth.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was co-written by Jeffrey Kluger, a journalist, and Apollo 13
                Mission Commander Jim Lovell.
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Moon"
                  >Wikipedia informs me</a
                >
                that the book was Kluger's idea, and pitched it to the two
                surviving Apollo 13 astronauts; Jack Swigert had died of cancer
                in 1982. "Fredo," as Lovell called Fred Haise, wasn't interested
                in the idea.
              </p>
              <p>
                The prologue starts off with the debunking of an urban myth that
                said that astronauts had poison pills they could take if they
                were ever stranded in space.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a serious book about a serious incident in history.
                Chapter one starts "Jim Lovell was having dinner at the White
                House when his friend Ed White burned to death" about the Apollo
                8 fire, although later it was found that the smoke poisoned
                them. It goes on describing how Lovell was a nerd who loved
                rockets as a teenager, and spoke of test piloting and early
                space flights before it gets around to the Apollo 13 launch.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's an excellent book, very well written. I found it enjoyable
                and informative. Any high school teacher who thinks about
                showing the class the fictional movie based on this fine book
                would be wise to read the book first.

                "Grambank is like a DNA code of languages," she said. "We can
                use it to make comparisons to build language trees or examine
                how languages that split from a common ancestor differ from each
                other. We can identify features that are very rare in languages
                across the globe and figure out which of those features are
                particularly associated with endangered languages."
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] "Once linguistic diversity is lost, it's not easily
                recovered," said Bowern, a historical linguist whose work
                focuses on language change and language documentation in
                Indigenous Australia. [...]
              </p>
              <p>
                The analysis also revealed that there is a lot more variation
                across languages than was widely believed and provides important
                insights into how languages evolve and diversify. For example,
                the researchers show that genealogy — the gradual changing and
                splitting of languages over time — plays a larger role in

                  <p>
                    ChatGPT may be well on its way to remaking the internet, but
                    you know where there isn't enough generative AI? On the
                    roads. Microsoft and Mercedes have announced a partnership
                    to test the integration of
                    <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/tag/chatgpt"
                      >ChatGPT</a
                    >
                    with Mercedes vehicles. The feature will launch in beta on
                    more than 900,000 vehicles in the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like most high-end carmakers, Mercedes has spent the last
                    few years developing bespoke vehicle technology. For
                    example, the company has its own Hey Mercedes voice
                    assistant, where ChatGPT will connect. Instead of reaching
                    out to the Mercedes AI model to understand spoken words, the
                    beta software will use ChatGPT to interpret what's said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft and Mercedes contend that using ChatGPT with Hey
                    Mercedes will make the system more reliable and expand its
                    capabilities. Most voice assistants, Hey Mercedes included,
                    are limited in what they can do and understand. You might
                    use a phrase that a person would interpret immediately that
                    flummoxes the AI. ChatGPT is much better at understanding
                    commands, and its grasp of context will allow drivers to
                    have multi-part conversations with the AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mercedes won't have to make any changes or updates to
                    cars to test ChatGPT. That's good because it's not fully
                    committed. Starting today, Mercedes will test ChatGPT for
                    three months. Drivers will be able to opt into the test from
                    the Mercedes app or from the car itself. Just say, "Hey
                    Mercedes, I want to join the beta program." Mercedes hasn't
                    explained what it plans to do after the test, but the press
                    release speaks vaguely about how beta findings could improve
                    future implementations of voice models and AI in Mercedes
                    vehicles.

                    [...] Founded in Columbus, Ohio in 1979, Micro Center is a
                    favorite shopping destination for anyone who builds PCs,
                    tinkers with Raspberry Pis or does any kind of 3D printing.
                    The company stocks more than 400 types of filament, along
                    with 3D printers and accessories from major vendors such as
                    Creality and AnyCubic. It's also one of the few places where
                    you can buy Raspberry Pi boards at MSRP, provided that they
                    are in stock.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unlike Best Buy, Amazon and Newegg, Micro Center's business
                    model revolves pretty-much exclusively around getting
                    customers to come into the store. Most of the products are
                    not available for purchase online, though you can reserve
                    them for in-store pickup.

                  <p>
                    Micro Center is also one of the few places you can actually
                    see and touch high-end peripherals and components. The
                    stores stock well over 150 different gaming keyboards from
                    brands such as Razer, Corsair and Asus. They also have about
                    the same number of PC cases, including those from Lian Li,
                    Fractal Design and NZXT. The Fractal Design North, our
                    current pick for best PC case, is available to see and buy
                    with all of its wood-paneled glory.

                    The lawsuit notes that the biggest social media firms –
                    TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat – have
                    entered into licensing agreements with the publishers and
                    other rights holders that compensate artists for the use of
                    their works on the platforms. Twitter, on the other hand,
                    has no such agreement in place, giving it an "unfair
                    advantage" over rivals. The company has been in talks since
                    2021 to license the music, but they stalled over the $100
                    million price and have stopped entirely since Musk took
                    control.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The publishers say that by hosting music without a
                    license, users can listen to the songs on the platform
                    rather than paying for a streaming service, using an
                    ad-supported social media site, or just buying the music
                    outright themselves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Twitter has gained a reputation for moving at a glacial pace
                    when it comes to removing copyrighted material - on those
                    occasions that it does. The Super Mario Bros movie was
                    available on the site for 2 days while it was still in
                    theaters, receiving 10 million views during that time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The suit also seeks a permanent injunction stopping Twitter
                    from infringing the publishers' copyrighted materials.

                    Increasing the photonic crystal lasers' size and brightness
                    did not come without challenges. Specifically, semiconductor
                    lasers encounter problems when their emission area is
                    expanded. A larger lasing area means there is room for light
                    to oscillate in the direction of emission as well as
                    laterally.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Noda explains that the next steps are to continue
                    scaling up the diameter of the laser from 3 to 10 mm, a size
                    that could produce 1 kilowatt of output power—although the
                    goal could also be reached using an array of 3-mm PCSELs. He
                    expects that the same technology that led to the 3-mm
                    devices could be used to scale up to 10 mm. "The same design
                    is enough," Noda says.

                    In partnership with the University of Toronto, Aurora
                    Innovation has publicly released the Aurora Multi-Sensor
                    Dataset, a large-scale multi-sensor data set with
                    localization ground truth. The data set consists of rich
                    metadata which includes semantic segmentation and a variety
                    of weather patterns such as rain, snow, overcast cloud and
                    sunshine, in addition to different times of day and varying
                    traffic conditions.<br />[...]<br />By releasing the data
                    set to the academic sector, Aurora aims to contribute
                    "meaningful engineering research and development" to support
                    progress within the autonomous systems field. Additionally,
                    due to the size and the diversity of Aurora's Multi-Sensor
                    Datatset, it can be used for 3D reconstruction, HD map
                    construction, map compression and more.

                    The data set was captured by Uber Advanced Technologies
                    Group (ATG) in the metropolitan area of Pittsburgh, USA
                    between January 2017 and February 2018. Aurora acquired the
                    data set in January 2021. Uber ATG used a 64-beam Velodyne
                    HDL-64E lidar sensor and seven 1920×1200-pixel resolution
                    cameras, in addition to a forward-facing stereo pair and
                    five wide-angle lenses providing a 360-degree view around
                    the vehicle to capture the data.

                    What do you do when US sanctions prevent the purchase of
                    high-performance Nvidia AI GPUs? In China, universities and
                    businesses are turning to underground dealers to secure
                    these chips, and paying a premium to get their hands on
                    them.

                  <p>
                    In September last year, the US further tightened sanctions
                    against China by instructing Nvidia and AMD to
                    <a

                    their high-performance AI-focused GPUs to the country (and
                    Russia), a restriction aimed at preventing the US companies'
                    top hardware from being used by or diverted to military
                    users and finding their way into the nation's
                    supercomputers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The sanctions mean that China cannot import Nvidia A100 or
                    H100 GPUs, while AMD's MI250 Instinct card is also
                    prohibited, leaving less powerful options such as the MI100
                    accelerator and the

                    alternative to the A100 GPU. The chip has an interconnect
                    speed of 400 GB/s, down from the A100's 600 GB/s.

                    that this year's generative AI boom led by OpenAI's ChatGPT
                    has seen demand for Nvidia's high-end chips skyrocket in
                    China. That's led to an underground market in the Asian
                    nation, where everyone from startups to universities is
                    paying large premiums to secure these GPUs - buying or
                    selling the chips within China is not illegal.

                  <p>
                    Reuters visited the famous Huaqiangbei electronics area in
                    the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen where two vendors told
                    reporters they could provide small numbers of A100 chips for
                    $20,000 each, double the usual price of around $10,000.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Hong Kong startup founder said he experienced the same
                    thing when quoted $19,150 each for two to four A100 cards,
                    which were needed to run its latest AI models. In addition
                    to paying much more than their MSRP, these cards lack any
                    kind of warranty or support.

              <p>
                I have seen most of the open letters and comments. There's a lot
                to cover, and honestly, a large post on the main page isn't a
                good way to do this. However, I will address the largest
                recurring theme, which is fear that people believe that the PBC
                is going to sell people's personal data, or otherwise harvest it
                beyond what we have.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PBC was specifically founded to keep SN as an independent
                entity so we wouldn't end up under another DICE-like entity.
                Slashdot changed legal owners many times over the years both in
                an effort to make it profitable through the .com era, and in
                later years, as a showcase for advertors to spend money on. From
                what I can tell, a lot of people fear that SoylentNews will
                essentially become what Slashdot Media
                (https://slashdotmedia.com/) is today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let me address this one right now. That isn't what is happening
                here.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now, Matt and I have officially held the meeting and did
                the paperwork to have kolie installed as COO as an officer of
                the PBC. He can speak on behalf of the company officially. Along
                those lines, we are determined to seek one or more qualified
                candidates to serve on the Board, with the goal of nominating at
                least one such candidate to the board no later than July 31,
                2023. The big news is - your voice is being represented - throw
                in your hat if you want to participate.
              </p>
              <p>
                At which point, we're going to take advantage of some foresight
                that we did 9 years ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                SoylentNews's public benefit corporations bylaws specifically
                allow for a business meeting to be held over IRC. So, at some
                point somewhat soon, we're going to host a formal meeting where
                the board (likely represented by me and kolie) will sit, and
                answer questions. An open form for questions will be posted,
                which will be consolidated down, and answered to the best of our
                ability.
              </p>
              <p>
                The specifics of that are TBD, but I expect to open the floor in
                early July, and leave the questions period open for a week or
                so. We will then edit the list down, contact each person who
                wishes to present, post what we are covering, and then schedule
                the meeting on IRC. That's probably going to be a lot of back
                and forth.
              </p>
              <p>
                The large shape of things I expect to come is going to be having
                the community much more directly involved in the business side,
                but that's going to likely require amending the bylaws, as well
                as having a specific written process of who is eligible, and all
                the paperwork that goes with.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am semi-expecting we're going to have to discuss aspects of
                this with legal assistance simply to determine what is and isn't
                possible under Delaware business law for a public benefit
                corporation.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is also the major step that will let me step out of the
                role of president of the PBC, and at the end of it, allow me to
                finally be able to step away, since there will be someone I can
                hand the role over to who will have legal responsibility for the
                site, and the knowledge that SN will not become DICEdot 2.0.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the honest truth is that while I am happy that SN
                appears to have a chance at continuing, and many of the very
                long standing issues being resolved, the personal cost to myself
                has been immense, especially in light of everything that has
                transpired.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's an ongoing discussion as to what my exit from the site
                is going to look like when the changing of the guard is
                complete. Right now, for that to happen, all the steps I just
                outlined, and then have to be accomplished, but I can at least
                say things are moving. Perhaps not as fast as we all would like,
                but they're moving.

                  <p>
                    Hackers from the BlackCat ransomware gang, also known as
                    ALPHV, are threatening to leak 80 gigabytes of confidential
                    data from Reddit that they claim to have stolen during a
                    February breach, according to a post from the group on the
                    dark web, which was reviewed by CNN and an independent
                    cybersecurity expert.

                  <p>
                    In their post, the hackers claim they first demanded a
                    US$4.5 million payout “for the deletion of the data and our
                    silence” in April. After receiving no response, the group
                    said it followed up on Friday with an additional demand:
                    Reddit should withdraw a controversial new pricing policy
                    that has sparked a protest from some of the platform’s most
                    influential users.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    that these protests were spearheaded by a “small group
                    that’s very upset” and it didn’t have any impact on the
                    company’s revenues. Through these public votes, communities
                    are trying to prove that a large number of people are

                    Privacy and security features that aim to give consumers
                    more control over the sharing of their data by smartphone
                    apps are widely misunderstood, shows new research from the
                    University of Bath's
                    <a

                  <p>
                    43 per cent of phone users in the study were confused or
                    unclear about what app tracking means. People commonly
                    mistook the purpose of tracking, thinking that it was
                    intrinsic to the app function, or that it would provide a
                    better user experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    App tracking is used by companies to deliver targeted
                    advertising to smartphone users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The most common misapprehension (24 per cent) was that
                    tracking refers to sharing the physical location of the
                    device - rather than tracing the use of apps and websites.
                    People thought they needed to accept tracking for food
                    delivery and collection services, such as Deliveroo, or for
                    health and fitness apps, because they believed their
                    location was integral to the functioning of the app.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While just over half of participants (51 per cent) said they
                    were concerned about privacy or security – including
                    security of their data after it had been collected -
                    analysis showed no association between their concern for
                    privacy in their daily life and a lower rate of tracking
                    acceptance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Some of the confusion is likely to be due to lack of
                    clarity in wording chosen by companies in the tracking
                    prompts, which are easy to misinterpret. For example, when
                    ASOS said 'We'll use your data to give you a more
                    personalised ASOS experience and to make our app even more
                    amazing' it's probably no surprise that people thought they
                    were opting for additional functionality rather than just
                    more relevant adverts."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Other misconceptions included believing that
                    consenting to sharing for health apps (such as period
                    tracking apps) would mean private data being shared, or that
                    denying tracking would remove adverts from the app.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "While people are now familiar with the benefits of
                    having PIN numbers and facial recognition to protect our
                    devices, more work needs to be done so people can make
                    transparent decisions about what other data is used for in
                    the digital age."

                    It also shows that even if the total amount of farmland
                    doesn't change across the globe in coming years, fewer
                    people will own and farm what land there is available. The
                    trend could threaten biodiversity in a time where
                    biodiversity conservation is top of mind.

                    "Larger farms typically have less biodiversity and more
                    monocultures," Mehrabi said. "Smaller farms typically have
                    more biodiversity and crop diversity, which makes them more
                    resilient to pest outbreaks and climate shocks."

                  <p>
                    And it's not just biodiversity: Food supply is also at risk.
                    Mehrabi's previous research shows the world's smallest farms
                    make up just 25% of the world's agricultural land but
                    harvest one-third of the world's food.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Currently, we have around 600 million farms feeding
                    the world, and they're carrying 8 billion people on their
                    shoulders," Mehrabi said. "By the end of the century, we'll
                    likely have half the number of farmers feeding even more
                    people. We really need to think about how we can have the
                    education and support systems in place to support those
                    farmers."

                    But all this work was ridiculed. Microsoft, through Github,
                    Google and Apple pushed for MIT/BSD licensed software as the
                    open source standard. This allowed them to use open source
                    components within their proprietary closed products. They
                    managed to make thousands of free software developers work
                    freely for them. And they even received praise because,
                    sometimes, they would hire one of those developers (like it
                    was a "favour" to the community while it is simply
                    business-wise to hire smart people working on critical
                    components of your infrastructure instead of letting them
                    work for free). The whole Google Summer of Code, for which I
                    was a mentor multiple years, is just a cheap way to get
                    unpaid volunteers mentor their future free or cheap
                    workforce.

                    Our freedoms were taken away by proprietary software which
                    is mostly coded by ourselves. For free. We spent our free
                    time developing, debugging, testing software before handing
                    them to corporations that we rever, hoping to maybe get a
                    job offer or a small sponsorship from them. Without
                    Non-copyleft Open Source, there would be no proprietary
                    MacOS, OSX nor Android. There would be no Facebook, no
                    Amazon. We created all the components of Frankenstein's
                    creature and handed them to the evil professor.

                    [...] Large language models will get worse if they are
                    increasingly trained on fake content generated by AI
                    collected from crowdsource platforms, the researchers
                    argued. Outfits like OpenAI keep exactly how they train
                    their latest models a close secret, and may not heavily rely
                    on things like Mechanical Turk, if at all. That said, plenty
                    of other models may rely on human workers, which may in turn
                    use bots to generate training data, which is a problem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mechanical Turk, for one, is marketed as a provider of "data
                    labeling solutions to power machine learning models."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Human data is the gold standard, because it is humans that
                    we care about, not large language models," Riberio said. "I
                    wouldn't take a medicine that was only tested in a
                    Drosophila biological model," he said as an example.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Responses generated by today's AI models are usually quite
                    bland or trivial, and do not capture the complexity and
                    diversity of human creativity, the researchers argued.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Sometimes what we want to study with crowdsourced data is
                    precisely the ways in which humans are imperfect," Robert
                    West, co-author of the paper and an assistant professor in
                    the EPFL's school of computer and communication science,
                    told us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As AI continues to improve, it's likely that crowdsourced
                    work will change. Riberio speculated that large language
                    models could replace some workers at specific tasks.
                    "However, paradoxically, human data may be more precious
                    than ever and thus it may be that these platforms will be
                    able to implement ways to prevent large language model usage
                    and ensure it remains a source of human data."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Who knows – maybe humans might even end up collaborating
                    with large language models to generate responses too, he
                    added.

                    PCIe 5.0 compatible and are compliant with the ATX 3.0
                    standard. In addition to meeting new spec guidelines, they
                    have the bonus of featuring yellow pin connectors on both
                    ends of the cable. The idea behind the subtle change is to
                    make it easier for users to see whether or not the cable is
                    completely inserted, preventing a few common hardware

                    According to MSI, users frequently reported problems with
                    burnt power supply connectors when using them with newer
                    high-end GPUs. Upon investigation, the team realized one of
                    the most common causes of this issue was

                    submarine that went missing in the North Atlantic on an
                    expedition to explore the wreckage of the Titanic. Lt.

                    confirmed to CBS News that personnel were "currently

                    At a news conference Monday afternoon, Rear Admiral John
                    Mauger confirmed that five people were on board. A Coast

                    [...] Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University,
                    thinks crypto is inherently susceptible to boom-and-boost
                    cycles and manipulation by insiders, and thinks it should be
                    banned. She says the SEC's actions could help re-confine
                    crypto to the realm of tech enthusiasts, given the wider
                    state of the industry.

                  <p>
                    "If we combine these enforcement actions with waning trust
                    from the public, with possibly waning interest from venture
                    capital, then maybe there isn't a future," she says.

                    But Mr Stephens, who has weathered two "crypto winters"
                    already, says he thinks the future remains bright - if at
                    risk of ending up overseas, given America's current
                    approach, which is seen as less friendly than other
                    jurisdictions, including the UK and the EU.

                    levels, but has gained significantly from the start of the
                    year. Ether has also risen.

                    intends to presumptively prohibit a large portion of
                    cryptocurrency banking activity, as the demand for more
                    guidance over digital assets has grown following rampant

                    published on Tuesday, the Board of Governors of the Federal
                    Reserve System offered an interpretation of section 9(13) of
                    the Federal Reserve Act to govern the use of digital assets
                    within the federal banking ecosystem. That section
                    specifically applies rules set by the Federal Reserve for
                    member banks, dictating the banking activity state
                    depository institutions are legally able to conduct as only
                    that which is also permissible for national banks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Federal Reserve member banks consist of financial
                    institutions at the state level that meet the operational
                    requirements of the Federal Reserve System, and are overseen
                    by the 12 designated regional banks across the U.S.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rule issues two directives pursuant to the Federal
                    Reserve's existing laws: that the Board will "presumptively
                    prohibit" member banks from holding most crypto assets, and
                    that member banks wishing to utilize dollar tokens will need
                    to prove certain security measures and receive formal
                    approval prior to its use in banking transactions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Both rules cite the "significant risks" associated with the
                    cryptocurrency sector, including fraud, legal ambiguity and
                    volatility.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Despite largely concurring that employing digital
                    assets in the U.S. banking system poses security threats,
                    the Board offered some avenues for potential incorporation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The final rule notes that issuing dollar tokens along
                    decentralized ledgers was also likely unsafe. However,
                    member banks are eligible to receive a "supervisory
                    nonobjection" from the Board provided they can demonstrate
                    the ability to conduct safe banking with dollar tokens.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Commonly referred to as stablecoins, dollar denominated
                    tokens differ from traditional cryptocurrencies in that they
                    are pegged to the U.S. dollar, thereby presenting a lower
                    risk in price volatility. Deploying dollar tokens along a
                    distributed ledger software still poses a significant amount
                    of cybersecurity and operation risks, according to the
                    Board, namely among illicit finance activity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The Board generally believes that issuing tokens on open,
                    public and/or decentralized networks or similar systems is
                    highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking
                    practices," it said.

                    in Switzerland, and <strong>Bank of America</strong>(<a

                      >BAC</a
                    >) just released a report suggesting that central bank
                    digital currencies have the potential to revolutionize the
                    global financial system. According to that report, these
                    digital currencies represent "the most significant
                    technological advancement in the history of money."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In many ways, it's a question of when, not if, this
                    transformational change is going to happen. According to the
                    Atlantic Council, 114 nations around the world are exploring
                    the introduction of CBDCs, and 18 of the G20 nations are in
                    the advanced stages of launching one. So, if CBDCs are "the
                    future of money," what does that mean for Bitcoin (<a
                      href="https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/btc/"
                      >BTC</a
                    >)? After all, wasn't Bitcoin supposed to be the future of
                    money?
                  </p>
                  <p>Scenario 1: CBDCs fail to take off</p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For reasons such as these, it's easy to imagine a
                    scenario in which CBDCs never really get off the ground, and
                    Bitcoin emerges as the winner when it comes to digital
                    currencies. In many ways, that was the vision that many
                    people had for
                    <a
                      href="https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/bitcoin/"
                      >Bitcoin</a
                    >
                    at the outset. For more than a decade, crypto enthusiasts
                    have argued that Bitcoin should replace traditional fiat
                    currencies. From this perspective, CBDCs are just
                    reinventing the wheel. If you buy into this narrative, then
                    Bitcoin is a strong long-term buy and hold, because it will
                    be the future of money.
                  </p>
                  <p>Scenario 2: CBDCs and Bitcoin coexist</p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This is probably the most likely scenario, simply
                    because there could be a massive outcry from the private
                    sector if any of today's major financial players -- such as
                    commercial banks -- are disintermediated out of the system.
                    And private citizens might respond quite negatively if they
                    think CBDCs are being used by central banks to gain
                    sensitive information or data about them, such as their
                    precise spending patterns.
                  </p>
                  <p>Scenario 3: CBDCs replace Bitcoin</p>
                  <p>
                    In this scenario, CBDCs become a huge hit, people realize
                    the limitations of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and
                    cash disappears. In this potential future, the past decade
                    will be seen as just a period of experimentation with
                    digital currencies. Historians will say that Bitcoin helped
                    pave the way for national CBDCs, but lament the fact that
                    the original crypto has largely been relegated to the
                    dustbin of history. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>Is Bitcoin the future of money?</p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ultimately, digital currencies have the potential to
                    revolutionize the global financial system, as Bank of
                    America suggests. The only question is who will be the
                    ultimate winners here. Right now, I'm putting my full faith
                    in Bitcoin. Governments are good at many things, but not at
                    financial innovation.

                    This is where IBM's new work comes in. In the experiment,
                    the company's researchers used a 127 qubit IBM Eagle
                    processor to calculate what's known as an Ising model,
                    simulating the behavior of 127 magnetic, quantum-sized
                    particles in a magnetic field — a problem that has
                    real-world value but, at that scale, is far too complicated
                    for classical computers to solve.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To mitigate the quantum noise, the researchers,
                    paradoxically, actually introduced <i>more</i> noise, and
                    then precisely documented its effects on each part of the
                    processor's circuit and the patterns that arose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] From there, the researchers could reliably extrapolate
                    what the calculations would have looked like without noise
                    at all. They call this process "error mitigation."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The level of agreement between the quantum and classical
                    computations on such large problems was pretty surprising to
                    me personally," co-author Andrew Eddins, a physicist at IBM
                    Quantum, said in a lengthy

                  <p>
                    As promising as the findings are, it's "not obvious that
                    they've achieved quantum supremacy here," co-author Michael
                    Zaletel, a UC Berkley physicist, told the <i>NYT</i>.

                    There is a widespread idea that modern high-performance x86
                    processors work by decoding the "complex" x86 instructions
                    into "simple" RISC-like instructions that the rest of the
                    pipeline then operates on. But how close is this idea to how
                    the processors actually work internally?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To answer this question, let's analyze how different x86
                    processors, ranging from the first "modern" Intel
                    microarchitecture, P6, to their current designs, handle the
                    following simple loop (the code is 32-bit just to allow us
                    to discuss very old x86 processors):

                    Sunshine levels have a significant impact on the bidding
                    behaviour of stock market investors, according to new
                    research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study examined the relationship between sunny weather
                    and how market participants perform, as well as the
                    subsequent seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). These discounts
                    for shares act as an effective tool for companies to raise
                    finance and are essential for a functioning modern economy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The data revealed investors made higher bids in sunny
                    periods, which led to lower discounts for shares in the
                    primary market. In fact, just a one standard deviation
                    increase in sunshine intensity caused bid discounts to
                    decline by 2.4 percent, while a one standard deviation
                    increase in sunshine duration caused bid discounts to drop
                    by 3.33 percent.

                    weather, often come good spirits – which in many

                    can lead to higher bid prices for seasoned equities."

                    Existing research has shown meteorological conditions,
                    especially exposure to sunshine, affects a person's
                    emotional state and sentiment. These weather-driven moods
                    have been proved to influence a buyer's car choice, art
                    prices at auction, and the tendency to take risks in a
                    lottery.

                  <p>
                    [...] Professor Liu added: "We want to make investors aware
                    that during periods of sunny weather, they become more
                    optimistic about their investments. This will make them more
                    inclined to take risks that aren't justified by asset
                    values. Therefore, they should factor this consideration in
                    when bidding for shares or they might suffer losses.

                    controlled the car he had taken us for a drive in. Built for
                    families and priced for an aspiring global middle class, the

                    Why do so few female school leavers with good grades in
                    mathematics choose to study a technical subject – despite
                    the high salaries and good employment prospects in the STEM
                    sector? This question has long preoccupied the social
                    sciences, especially as studies show that girls and boys do
                    equally well in mathematics at school.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is possible that socially embedded gender stereotypes
                    play a role, such as: men think logically and in abstract
                    terms, women are more creative; men should be the
                    breadwinners, women take care of the family; men are
                    competitive, women are more risk-averse. A study by Benita
                    Combet from the Department of Sociology at the University of
                    Zurich has now shown that some of these ingrained beliefs do
                    indeed influence people's subject choices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Especially with regard to factors such as logical
                    thinking style and technical skills, strong gender
                    stereotypes still exist, which obviously significantly
                    influence the decisions of female high school students,"
                    says Combet. "We should therefore continue to work on
                    challenging and questioning these fixed beliefs." With
                    regard to analytical thinking, for example, it has by no
                    means been scientifically proven that there are differences
                    between men and women. Moreover, the ability to think
                    analytically is a basic requirement for almost every subject
                    area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Combet also believes schoolchildren should be given better
                    and more detailed information about future subject choices:
                    "Many of their current perceptions are not accurate." For
                    example, many believe that to be good at engineering, all
                    you need is an affinity for technology. In fact, says
                    Combet, "interpersonal and creative skills are also
                    important in engineering, for example working in a team to
                    develop new products."

                [hubie] How often do you extend the life or repurpose retired
                mobile devices and how have you done it? Through advice and
                encouragement I got from the SN community, a few years ago I
                resurrected an old Samsung tablet by installing LineageOS and I

                    The charges laid against Ortmann and van der Kolk have

                    Justice Fitzgerald consider the pair had demonstrated
                    remorse, had gone straight – ironically by building a legit
                    cloud storage called "Mega" – and had personal mitigating

                    Ortmann was therefore sentenced to two years and seven
                    months' imprisonment and van der Kolk will spend two years
                    and six months at His Majesty's pleasure. Both pled guilty
                    to obtaining documents dishonestly, conspiring to cause loss
                    by deception, and participation in an organized criminal
                    group. The pair must also forfeit funds held in Hong Kong,

                  <p>
                    What's old is new again, at least in the European Union. The
                    European Parliament recently voted in favor of new
                    legislation that would overhaul the entire battery life
                    cycle, from design to end-of-life, which includes important
                    caveats for smartphone users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among the many changes, the new rules would require
                    batteries in consumer devices like smartphones to be easily
                    removable and replaceable. That's far from the case today
                    with most phones, but that wasn't always the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the earlier days of mobile phones (think Nokia 5190,
                    Nokia 3310, Motorola Razr V3, Palm Treo 700p), swapping out
                    the battery took mere seconds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] For phones with "internal" batteries, you'd simply
                    pop off the rear cover of the device, lift the battery out,
                    put a fresh one in, and button it back up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Manufacturers eventually moved away from easily swappable
                    batteries in favor of "sealed" handsets sporting sleeker
                    designs. Many consumers were vocal about the change but over
                    time, most accepted it as the new norm and moved on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] This is not the first time the EU has prompted a
                    rethink. Last year, the EU set a deadline of December 28,
                    2024, for phones and other small electronic devices to
                    include a USB-C port for charging. That's a problem for
                    Apple considering the iPhone uses a proprietary Lightning
                    port.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                In that final paragraph, that standard USB-C charging port may
                be a problem for Tesla and other EV charging unless the EV owner
                has a really good USB-C cable.

                    have tablets installed inside, they will also appear there.
                    For the Uber Eats app, video ads will play after customers
                    place orders and continue until their deliveries arrive.
                    Drizly, on its way, will have them in search results on its

                    The philosophy changed with the Spirit and Opportunity
                    rovers, whose teams started using more intentional names.
                    For instance, the Opportunity team nicknamed a crater
                    "Endurance" to honor the ship that carried explorer Ernest
                    Shackleton's ill-fated expedition to Antarctica. The names
                    for the spots where Curiosity and Perseverance landed honor
                    science-fiction writers Ray Bradbury and Octavia E. Butler,
                    respectively. The InSight team named a rock that had been
                    jostled by the lander's retrorockets during touchdown
                    "Rolling Stones Rock," after the band. And the Curiosity
                    team named a Martian hill after their colleague Rafael
                    Navarro-González, who died from COVID-19 complications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Then, as now, team members suggested ideas for themes
                    based on sites where they have worked or to which they have
                    a personal connection, and they informally discussed which
                    would be the most interesting to include, keeping in mind
                    that various names would be memorialized in future
                    scientific papers. Once a theme is picked, hundreds of names
                    fitting into that theme are compiled. That many are needed
                    because the available names can dwindle quickly, given that
                    Curiosity may stay in a quadrant for several months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Curiosity's latest quadrant, the rover's team chose a
                    theme named after Roraima, the northernmost state of Brazil,
                    and for Mount Roraima, the highest peak in the Pacaraima
                    Mountains, located near the border of Venezuela, Brazil, and
                    Guyana. This marked the first South American quadrant theme.
                    The sulfate-enriched region Curiosity is currently
                    exploring, with its flat-topped hills and steep slopes,
                    reminded them of the "tabletop" mountains in the Pacaraima
                    range.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Perseverance, scientists chose to go with national park
                    themes. The rover is now exploring the Rocky Mountain
                    quadrant and recently drilled into rocks at a location
                    bearing the nickname of Rocky Mountain National Park's
                    "Powell Peak."
