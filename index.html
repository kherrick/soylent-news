                    Think of the worst invasive species you know. Kudzu:
                    smothering trees and houses, growing a foot a day. Burmese
                    pythons: stripping the Everglades of small animals.

                    They all came from somewhere else, arrived with no natural
                    predators, outcompeted local flora and fauna, and took over
                    whole ecosystems. But they all have their limitations: Kudzu
                    dies in a hard freeze, carp can't tolerate salt water, and
                    pythons can't cover long distances very fast. (Thankfully.)

                    Now imagine a species with all those benefits—foreign
                    origin, no enemies—and no roadblocks to dominance: One that
                    is indifferent to temperature, comfortable in many
                    landscapes, able to run a lot faster than you, and muscular
                    enough to leave a big dent in your car. That describes any
                    of the possibly 6 million feral hogs in the United States,
                    the most intractable invasives that most people have never
                    heard of.<br />[...]<br />USDA research estimates that, on

                    Researchers have analyzed samples of asteroid Ryugu
                    collected by the Japanese Space Agency's Hayabusa2
                    spacecraft and found uracil—one of the informational units
                    that make up RNA, the molecules that contain the
                    instructions for how to build and operate living organisms.
                    Nicotinic acid, also known as Vitamin B3 or niacin, which is
                    an important cofactor for metabolism in living organisms,
                    was also detected in the same samples.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This discovery by an international team, led by Associate
                    Professor Yasuhiro Oba at Hokkaido University, adds to the
                    evidence that important building blocks for life are created
                    in space and could have been delivered to Earth by
                    meteorites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Scientists have previously found nucleobases and vitamins
                    in certain carbon-rich meteorites, but there was always the
                    question of contamination by exposure to the Earth's
                    environment," Oba explained. "Since the Hayabusa2 spacecraft
                    collected two samples directly from asteroid Ryugu and
                    delivered them to Earth in sealed capsules, contamination
                    can be ruled out."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We found uracil in the samples in small amounts, in the
                    range of 6–32 parts per billion (ppb), while vitamin B3 was
                    more abundant, in the range of 49–99 ppb," Oba elaborated.
                    "Other biological molecules were found in the sample as
                    well, including a selection of amino acids, amines and
                    carboxylic acids, which are found in proteins and
                    metabolism, respectively." The compounds detected are
                    similar but not identical to those previously discovered in
                    carbon-rich meteorites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The discovery of uracil in the samples from Ryugu lends
                    strength to current theories regarding the source of
                    nucleobases in the early Earth," Oba concludes. "The
                    OSIRIS-REx mission by NASA will be returning samples from
                    asteroid Bennu this year, and a comparative study of the
                    composition of these asteroids will provide further data to
                    build on these theories."

                    The Soviet Union created the Baikonur Cosmodrome in 1955 to
                    serve as a test site for intercontinental ballistic
                    missiles. A few years later it became the world's first
                    spaceport with the launch of the historic Sputnik 1 and
                    Vostok 1 missions. The sprawling cosmodrome was a mainstay
                    of the Soviet space program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia began to lease
                    the spaceport from the government of Kazakhstan and
                    currently has an agreement to use the facilities through the
                    year 2050. Russia pays an annual lease fee of about $100
                    million. Neither country is particularly happy with the
                    relationship; the Kazakh government feels like it is
                    under-compensated, and the Russian government would like it
                    to be in its own country, which is why it has moved in
                    recent years to build a new launch site for most of its
                    rockets in the Far East of Russia, at Vostochny.

                    [...] Earlier this month a Kazakh news site, KZ24, reported
                    that the Republic of Kazakhstan had seized the property of
                    TsENKI, the Center for Utilization of Ground-based Space
                    Infrastructure, in Kazakhstan. This firm, which is a
                    subsidiary of Roscosmos, is responsible for launch pads and
                    ground support equipment for the Russian space corporation.

                    [...] Russia has already spent nearly $1 billion on the
                    development of the new Soyuz-5 rocket and plans for its
                    launch site and ground services. When

                    dispute with Kazakhstan, it likely will be delayed much
                    longer into the future.

                    [...] Finding out whether another being can feel pain is
                    really difficult, even when it comes to humans. Until the
                    mid-1980s babies in the US were routinely operated on
                    with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23548489/"
                      >little or no anesthesia</a
                    >, due to the mistaken belief that very young infants were
                    incapable of perceiving pain. In one famous case, a
                    premature baby in Maryland born in 1985 underwent open heart
                    surgery without any anesthesia at all. When Jill Lawson, the
                    boy's mother, later <a
                      href="https://dolor.org.co/biblioteca/articulos/MOderna%20historia%20dolor%20pediatrico.pdf"
                      >questioned her doctors</a
                    >, she was told that premature babies couldn't feel pain—a
                    scientific misunderstanding that was later overturned partly
                    thanks to the campaigning of people like Lawson.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If scientists can misunderstand pain in humans for so long,
                    what hope do we have in figuring it out in insects? When
                    searching for answers, there are a handful of signs
                    researchers look for. One is the presence of
                    nociceptors—neurons that respond to painful stimuli from the
                    outside world. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] If we're going to farm animals that are candidates for
                    sentience, then there should be welfare standards, says
                    Birch. Right now there are no widely recognized welfare
                    guidelines for farmed insects, and few laws that
                    specifically require insect farmers to meet certain welfare
                    standards. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] An even bigger quandary is how insects should be
                    slaughtered. In the EU, most animals <a
                      href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2012/120375/LDM_BRI(2012)120375_REV2_EN.pdf"
                      >must be</a
                    >
                    stunned unconscious before they're killed, but no such
                    regulations exist for insects. [...] "Trying to make sure
                    that we are killing quickly and efficiently, given the level
                    of uncertainty, is perhaps one of the most important things
                    we can do," Fischer says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The issue for Fischer isn't whether we should farm insects
                    at all—it's about taking insect welfare more seriously and
                    making sure the industry does too. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And that means two things. One, it's about more work on
                    animal sentience—in particular the handful of species that
                    are most commonly farmed. "For at least these insect
                    species, we would want to have some certainty of what
                    constitutes humane slaughtering procedures and what are
                    acceptable rearing conditions and so on," says Chittka. "We
                    need that research now."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's also about widening our sense of which animals deserve
                    our compassion. It's easy to look into the eyes of a dog, or
                    a chimp, and intuit that these animals have feelings that we
                    can influence. It's much more difficult to look upon a tray
                    of mealworms and make the same observation. If we're going
                    to start farming these animals en masse, though, the kindest
                    thing to do might be to err on the side of caution.

                    U.S. regulators last year put into place rules that stopped
                    Nvidia from selling its two most advanced chips, the A100
                    and newer H100, to Chinese customers. Such chips are crucial
                    to developing generative AI technologies like OpenAI's
                    ChatGPT and similar products.

                    >
                    that reduced some capabilities of the A100 to make the A800
                    legal for export to China.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Tuesday, the company confirmed that it has similarly
                    developed a China-export version of its H100 chip. The new
                    chip, called the H800, is being used by the cloud computing
                    units of Chinese technology firms such as Alibaba Group
                    Holding, Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings, a company
                    spokesperson said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    U.S. regulators last fall imposed rules to slow China's
                    development in key technology sectors such as semiconductors
                    and artificial intelligence, aiming to hobble the country's
                    efforts to modernize its military.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rules around artificial intelligence chips imposed a
                    test that bans those with both powerful computing
                    capabilities and high chip-to-chip data transfer rates.
                    Transfer speed is important when training artificial
                    intelligence models on huge amounts of data because slower
                    transfer rates mean more training time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A chip industry source in China told Reuters the H800 mainly
                    reduced the chip-to-chip data transfer rate to about half
                    the rate of the flagship H100.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Nvidia spokesperson declined to say how the
                    China-focused H800 differs from the H100, except that "our
                    800 series products are fully compliant with export control
                    regulations."

                    A tiny satellite with a drag chute built by a team of
                    students has been held up as one small possible solution to
                    the thorny issue of space junk caused by defunct hardware
                    cluttering up Earth's orbit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    SBUDNIC, a "Sputnik-like CubeSat," was built by students at
                    Brown University, Rhode Island, from low-cost commercial
                    off-the-shelf parts. It has successfully demonstrated the
                    use of a simple drag sail that helps to degrade the
                    satellite's orbit and push it back into the planet's
                    atmosphere faster than would otherwise have occurred.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The idea behind
                    <a href="https://sbudnic.space/">SBUDNIC</a> was to
                    demonstrate how future satellites could avoid adding to this
                    problem by including a mechanism to help de-orbit them at
                    the end of their life span. The aerodynamic drag device
                    pulls the satellite out of orbit approximately three times
                    faster than comparable satellites, according to Brown
                    University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The satellite itself is a 3U Cubesat (where 1U is 10
                    cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, not to be confused with a datacenter
                    rack unit). According to details given by the university, it
                    includes a $10 Arduino microprocessor, 65 AA Energizer
                    lithium batteries and a variety of 3D printed parts produced
                    with consumer-grade printers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also 3D printed is the drag sail, made from Kapton polyimide
                    film, which apparently has the right combination of
                    properties to withstand extreme temperature and vibration.
                    This was folded flat along the satellite's frame prior to
                    deployment, using spring-loaded structural masts made of
                    thin aluminum tubing designed to extend out upon triggering
                    of the release mechanism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Initial computational predictions suggest that the
                    drag device will decrease the orbital lifetime of SBUDNIC
                    from over 20 years to as few as 6.5 years, depending on
                    fluctuations of atmospheric density.

                    By scanning and distributing digital books to readers free
                    of charge, the lawsuit claims Internet Archive is exploiting
                    "the investments that publishers have made in their books,
                    and it does so through a business model that is designed to
                    free-ride on the work of others." The book publishers say
                    this practice makes Internet Archive "nothing more than a
                    mass copier and distributor of bootleg works."

                    The publishers received support for their lawsuit from the
                    Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers.
                    Maria Pallante, chief executive of the association,
                    criticized Internet Archive's practices, telling the Wall
                    Street Journal, "If this conduct is normalized, there would
                    be no point to the Copyright Act." She added, "It would
                    effectively render the rights of authors, including the
                    right to market and monetize their works, meaningless."

                    It looks to be the end of the line for NASA's Aeronomy of
                    Ice in the Mesosphere, or AIM, spacecraft. The mission
                    launched on April 25, 2007, as part of the Small Explorer
                    program (the 90th such mission since 1958). The satellite
                    featured three science instruments designed to study polar
                    mesospheric clouds (PMCs) that form high above Earth in the
                    polar regions.

                  <p>
                    The satellite was put into orbit 312 miles up. Data from the
                    long-running mission helped scientists better understand the
                    formation of these unique clouds, also called night-shining
                    or noctilucent clouds, and was featured in 379 peer-reviewed
                    scientific papers over the years.

                    AIM had a planned mission duration of just 26 months but has
                    been operating mostly issue-free for nearly 16 years. In
                    2019, however, NASA noticed the satellite's batteries were
                    starting to degrade but were still functional enough to
                    continue to collect a significant amount of data and return
                    it to Earth.

                    the craft's battery has reached a point where it is no
                    longer able to receive commands or collect data. The space
                    agency will monitor the satellite for a two-week period and
                    attempt to reboot it, but it isn't looking good.

                    HTTPS and TELNET support soon followed. According to
                    Stenberg, curl was initially released under the General
                    Public License (GPL) but was put under an Mozilla Public
                    License (MPL) by the end of 1998. In 2001, curl added a new
                    license that's
                    <a href="https://curl.se/docs/copyright.html"
                      >close but not identical to the MIT license</a

                  <p>
                    The project has become a juggernaut. Stenberg says that his
                    goal has been simply to keep improving the code over time.
                    And in the years he and other contributors have worked on
                    it, curl grew and grew, reaching hundreds of millions of
                    installations in 2010. Today it's estimated to have been
                    installed more than ten billion times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As of the start of 2023, curl consisted of 155,100 lines of
                    code. It incorporates contributions from

                Despite technology bringing new recording media formats and
                improved compression algorithms, there is certainly a growing
                demand for vinyl again despite its death being announced several
                times over recent decades.

                    Metallica has bought a majority stake in Furnace Record
                    Pressing, one of the biggest and most important vinyl
                    records companies in the U.S. If anyone had any doubts about
                    the growth of the vinyl sales, which last year outpaced CD
                    sales for the first time since 1987, Metallica's new
                    purchase just gave them a very loud reminder that what's old
                    is new again.

                    Vinyl records are experiencing a renaissance among music
                    lovers. Although Metallica hasn't released a new album since
                    Hardwired...To Self-Destruct in 2016, it sold more than
                    387,000 vinyl albums in 2022, according to data from
                    Billboard. That year, it ranked sixth on the list of most
                    albums sold in the U.S., topping the 337,000 albums it sold
                    in 2021. The price Metallica paid for Furnace was not
                    disclosed; members of the band will now sit on Furnace's
                    board.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Metallica is expected to release its first album in seven
                    years sometime over the next few weeks, setting the stage
                    for the band to sell to many, many more vinyl records in
                    2023.

                    The cuts will take place in coming weeks and are mainly
                    concentrated in Amazon's web, HR and advertising team. Staff

                    CEO Andy Jassy said the decision was made to ensure the
                    company remained "streamlined" as tough market conditions

                    Six days ago, another massive tech giant, Facebook owner
                    Meta, also announced mass job redundancies. Meta chief
                    executive officer Mark Zuckerberg told employees that his
                    company was laying off another 10,000 employees and closing
                    about 5000 additional open roles in its own second major
                    round of job cuts.

                    Closer to home, Australia has also been pummelled by the
                    tough economic conditions. Earlier this month, ASX-listed
                    software firm Xero announced that it was going to reduce its
                    headcount by 700 to 800 roles, which was a 15 per cent cut
                    to the overall workforce. A few days earlier, software giant
                    Atlassian slashed 500 roles, which represents five per cent
                    of its total global workforce. Another software development
                    company, Kinde, laid off 28.5 per cent of staff at the end
                    of last month.

                    Wang and Fei suggest that the violent environment of early
                    Earth would have actually created the circumstances that
                    would turn the mantle into a giant "pour over" coffee
                    apparatus, allowing percolation of liquid metal through an
                    interconnected network. They analyzed the chemical exchanges
                    during this percolation process. Their results would account
                    for iron-loving elements being left behind in the mantle,
                    shedding light on a longstanding geochemistry question.

                    Today, Zipline delivers 75% of Rwanda's blood supply outside
                    the capital of Kigali. Zipline drones now serve 3,400 health
                    centers and over 45 million people.

                    The company is planning to complete about 1 million
                    deliveries by the end of 2023. By 2025, the company hopes to
                    operate more flights annually than almost all major U.S.
                    airlines.

                    long-range deliveries. The company claims to reduce carbon
                    emissions of deliveries by 97% when compared to gas cars.
                    Zipline drones now fly in seven different countries and
                    three U.S. states. In 2024, the company plans to begin
                    operations in Michigan and Washington with more states to
                    follow.

                    mishandling of its biggest round of layoffs ever has
                    employees up in arms, and they're doing everything from

                    First up, European Googlers are just now being laid off due

                    reports that more than 200 workers were laid off from the
                    Zurich, Switzerland, branch of the company this week. The
                    employees at that office walked out for a second time in

                    [...] Making Google honor its previous leave agreements
                    isn't just about employees getting paid when they have
                    medical or family issues; it's also about having continual
                    medical care when they need it most. As part of Google's
                    (seemingly discarded) plan to offer employees every perk
                    imaginable, the company has

                    While employees' severance packages might come with a few
                    more months of health insurance, being fired means instantly
                    losing access to Google's facilities. If that's where a
                    laid-off Googler's primary care doctor works, that person is
                    out of luck, and some employees told CNBC they lost access
                    to their doctors the second the layoff email arrived.
                    Employees on leave also have a lot to deal with. One former

                    conspirators, prosecutors said, including a man in his 20s
                    who called himself Ricky Vaughn. On Monday he will go on
                    trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn under his real

                    East Side of Manhattan, used hashtags and memes as part of

                    disinformation. While some of those attempts were
                    orchestrated by Russian security services, others were said
                    to have emanated from American internet trolls.

                    This week, NASA announced it has selected the company
                    Firefly Aerospace to develop a commercial lander for the far
                    side of the moon. The lander, called Blue Ghost, will be
                    used to deliver several NASA payloads to the moon, including
                    a radio observation mission which is placed on the far side
                    of the moon to minimize the radio noise coming from Earth.
                    This natural radio quiet zone will let the Lunar Surface
                    Electromagnetics Experiment-Night (LuSEE-Night) telescope
                    detect faint radio waves from an early period of the
                    universe known as the cosmic dark ages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As well as LuSEE-Night, Firefly will also be tasked
                    with carrying a communications and data relay satellite
                    called Lunar Pathfinder, which is a collaboration between
                    NASA and the European Space Agency, and which will be
                    deployed into orbit before the lander sets down on the
                    moon's surface. In addition, the NASA User Terminal payload
                    will assist with communications, and there will be up to
                    seven other payloads from private companies included as
                    well.

                    and the rocket was able to deploy its orbital payloads.

                  <p>

                  <p>
                    Air pollution is a major public health problem: The World
                    Health Organization has estimated that it leads to over 4
                    million premature deaths worldwide annually. Still, it is
                    not always extensively measured. But now an MIT research
                    team is rolling out an open-source version of a low-cost,
                    mobile pollution detector that could enable people to track
                    air quality more widely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The detector, called Flatburn, can be made by 3D printing or
                    by ordering inexpensive parts. The researchers have now
                    tested and calibrated it in relation to existing
                    state-of-the-art machines, and are publicly releasing all
                    the information about it - how to build it, use it, and
                    interpret the data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Flatburn concept at Senseable City Lab dates back to
                    about 2017, when MIT researchers began prototyping a mobile
                    pollution detector, originally to be deployed on garbage
                    trucks in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The detectors are
                    battery-powered and rechargable, either from power sources
                    or a solar panel, with data stored on a card in the device
                    that can be accessed remotely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In both cases, the detectors were set up to measure
                    concentrations of fine particulate matter as well as
                    nitrogen dioxide, over an area of about 10 meters. Fine
                    particular matter refers to tiny particles often associated
                    with burning matter, from power plants, internal combustion
                    engines in autos and fires, and more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The goal is for community groups or individual citizens
                    anywhere to be able to measure local air pollution, identify
                    its sources, and, ideally, create feedback loops with
                    officials and stakeholders to create cleaner conditions,"
                    says Carlo Ratti, director of MIT's Senseable City Lab.

                    [...] Living in the Swedish capital Stockholm, the
                    33-year-old regularly travels by rail, not only to visit her
                    family in Luxembourg, but also to her holiday destinations.

                    She favours train travel over flying mainly for
                    environmental reasons. Yet she adds that trains are simply
                    more enjoyable, especially sleeper services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The carbon footprint is just a fraction of a flight.
                    Flying from Stockholm to Hamburg results in around 250kg of
                    carbon dioxide emissions per passenger,

                    By contrast, the C02 released by travelling via
                    electric-powered train is just 26kg.

                    The SJ night train has nine coaches, and capacity to carry
                    400 passengers. Dan Olofsson, head of tendered services at
                    SJ, says the new service was proposed by the Swedish
                    government, "as they wanted to move more people towards
                    climate-friendly travelling, and one of the solutions was
                    the night train between Sweden and Germany".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The service is powered by renewable energy, and Mr Olofsson
                    says it is typically being used by Swedes to connect them to
                    other rail services from Hamburg.

                  <p>
                    "Hamburg isn't the main destination for most travellers, but
                    is an important hub for people to reach more destinations in
                    Germany and France and so on," he says.

                    [...] However, depending on the location, and especially if
                    starting from the UK, travelling by train can often be more
                    expensive than flying. Trains fares in the UK can in fact be
                    50% more costly than flights,

                has gone into the AI to generate the production, and how much

                    or even outside of the company is test driving the chip.
                    This may be a sign that the CPU will be released in the
                    foreseeable future, though it is unclear when exactly.
                    Meanwhile, based on unofficial information, AMD is set to
                    release its Phoenix 2 APUs in the second half of 2023.

                    Whether we're night owls or morning larks, our body clocks
                    are set by the sun. Theoretically, changing day length and
                    light exposure over the course of the year could affect the
                    duration and quality of our sleep. But figuring out how this
                    applies in practice is difficult. Although studies where
                    people assess their own sleep have suggested an increase in
                    sleep duration during winter, objective measures are needed
                    to determine how exactly the seasons affect sleep.
                    Scientists studying sleep difficulties have now published
                    data in
                    <em
                      ><a

                    that shows that, even in an urban population experiencing
                    disrupted sleep, humans experience longer REM sleep in
                    winter than summer and less deep sleep in autumn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Possibly one of the most precious achievements in human
                    evolution is an almost invisibility of seasonality on the
                    behavioral level," said Dr Dieter Kunz, corresponding author
                    of the study, based at the Clinic of Sleep &amp;
                    Chronomedicine at the St Hedwig Hospital, Berlin. "In our
                    study we show that human sleep architecture varies
                    substantially across seasons in an adult population living
                    in an urban environment."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Even though the patients were based in an urban
                    environment with low natural light exposure and high light
                    pollution, which should affect any seasonality regulated by
                    light, the scientists found subtle but striking changes
                    across the seasons. Although total sleep time appeared to be
                    about an hour longer in the winter than the summer, this
                    result was not statistically significant. However, REM sleep
                    was 30 minutes longer in the winter than in summer. REM
                    sleep is known to be directly linked to the circadian clock,
                    which is affected by changing light. Although the team
                    acknowledged that these results would need to be validated
                    in a population which experiences no sleep difficulties, the
                    seasonal changes may be even greater in a healthy
                    population.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Seasonality is ubiquitous in any living being on this
                    planet," said Kunz. "Even though we still perform unchanged,
                    over the winter human physiology is down-regulated, with a
                    sensation of 'running-on-empty' in February or March. In
                    general, societies need to adjust sleep habits including
                    length and timing to season, or adjust school and working
                    schedules to seasonal sleep needs."

                    The tricky issue is that there is no simple way to read out
                    how much fuel remains, so engineers use methods like heating
                    up the tank and seeing how long it takes to reach a
                    temperature, which indicates how much mass is inside. This
                    method had been used to calculate the low amount of
                    remaining fuel, so either there was a leak in the spacecraft
                    or else the measurement was wrong.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "First, we had to verify the spacecraft was OK," said Joseph
                    Hunt, Odyssey's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion
                    Laboratory, in a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/engineers-keep-an-eye-on-fuel-supply-of-nasas-oldest-mars-orbiter"
                      >statement</a
                    >. "After ruling out the possibility of a leak or that we
                    were burning more fuel than estimated, we started looking at
                    our measuring process."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After examining the systems, the team found that the issue
                    was to do with how the spacecraft heats up and cools down.
                    Because electronics need to be kept warm to operate properly
                    in the cold space environment, Odyssey uses heaters to keep
                    parts including the fuel tanks warm. But these heaters were
                    also warming the fuel within the tanks, so when the team
                    performed their thermal measurements to estimate remaining
                    fuel, it looked like there was less fuel inside than there
                    actually was.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our method of measurement was fine. The problem was that
                    the fluid dynamics occurring on board Odyssey are more
                    complicated than we thought," Jared Call, Odyssey's mission
                    manager, said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The good news is that with the heat accounted for, Odyssey
                    has at least 9 pounds of fuel left, which should last until
                    at least the end of 2025. So Odyssey will be able to
                    continue observing Mars and may even make it to a 25-year
                    anniversary.

                I just bought my second Haas CNC mill. I use them primarily to
                make parts for implantable medical devices, but they could just
                as easily make parts for small arms, guided missiles, or
                aircraft. Most big names in CNC machine tools are Eastern;
                Japanese, Taiwanese, or Chinese, with a few European. Haas, the
                biggest and most well known Western manufacturer of CNC machine
                tools, stands accused of continuing to supply Russian companies
                involved in military manufacturing, long after the beginning of
                the Russo-Ukrainian war.

                    Swear words across different languages may tend to lack
                    certain sounds such as <em>l</em>, <em>r</em>, and
                    <em>w</em>, suggests research published in
                    <em>Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review</em>. This common
                    pattern in profanity indicates that these sounds, called
                    approximants, may appear less offensive to listeners.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Swear words are thought to have sounds that help facilitate
                    the expression of emotion and attitude, but no study to date
                    has investigated if there is a universal pattern in the
                    sound of swearing across different languages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The authors asked 215 participants (from across six
                    different languages) to rate pairs of pseudo-words
                    (imaginary words created by the authors), one of which
                    included an approximant. For example, in Albanian, the
                    authors took the word "<em>zog</em>", meaning
                    "<em>bird</em>", and changed this to "<em>yog</em>" to
                    include an approximant and "<em>tsog</em>" without an
                    approximant. The authors found that participants were
                    significantly less likely to judge that words with
                    approximants were swear words and selected words without
                    approximants as swear words 63% of the time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a following study, the authors also looked at minced
                    oaths – which are variations of swear words deemed less
                    offensive, for example "<em>darn</em>" instead of
                    "<em>damn</em>". The authors found that approximants were
                    significantly more frequent in minced oaths than swear
                    words. The authors propose that this introduction of
                    approximants is part of what makes minced oaths less
                    offensive than swear words.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The authors conclude that their work suggests a potential
                    universal pattern to swear words across different languages,
                    with the lack of approximants a common feature when
                    perceiving swear words.

                    interface. So let's see what it takes to hack on something
                    that powerful. PCIe is be a bit intimidating at first,
                    however it is reasonably simple to start building PCIe
                    stuff, and the interface is quite resilient for
                    hobbyist-level technology. There will come a time when we
                    want to use a PCIe chip in our designs, or perhaps, make use
                    of the PCIe connection available on a certain Compute
                    Module, and it's good to make sure that we're ready for
                    that.

                    PCIe is everywhere now. Every modern computer has a bunch of
                    PCIe devices performing crucial functions, and even iPhones
                    use PCIe internally to connect the CPU with the flash and
                    WiFi chips. You can get all kinds of PCIe devices: Ethernet
                    controllers, high-throughput WiFi cards, graphics, and all
                    the cheap NVMe drives that gladly provide you with heaps of
                    storage when connected over PCIe. If you're hacking on a
                    laptop or a single-board computer and you'd like to add a
                    PCIe device, you can get some PCIe from one of the
                    PCIe-carrying sockets, or just tap into an existing PCIe
                    link if there's no socket to connect to. It's been two
                    decades since we've started getting PCIe devices – now, PCIe
                    is on its 5.0 revision, and it's clear that it's here to
                    stay.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    PCIe is a point-to-point bus that connect two devices
                    together – as opposed to PCI, an older bus, that could
                    connect a chain of devices on your mainboard. One side of a
                    PCIe link is a device, and another is a host. For instance,
                    in a laptop, your CPU will have multiple PCIe ports – some
                    used to connect the GPU, some used to connect a WiFi card,
                    some used for Ethernet, and some used for a NVMe drive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each PCIe link consists of at least three differential pairs
                    – one is a 100 MHz clock, REFCLK, that is (almost) always
                    required for a link, and two pairs that form a PCIe lane –
                    one for transmit and another for receive. This is an x link
                    – you can also have 2x, 4x, 8x and 16x links, with four,
                    eight sixteen and thirty-two differential pairs
                    respectively, plus, again, REFCLK. The wider the link, the
                    higher its throughput!

                    There are four key ways to ensure the effectiveness of such
                    training and education. First, we must be able to detect
                    foreign cyber influence operations. No individual
                    organization will be able to do this on its own. Instead, we
                    will need the support of academic institutions, nonprofit
                    organizations, and other entities to better analyze and
                    report on cyber influence operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, defenses must be strengthened to account for the
                    challenges and opportunities that technology has created for
                    the world's democracies — especially when it comes to the
                    disruption of independent journalism, local news, and
                    information accuracy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another element in combating this widespread deception is
                    radical transparency. We recommend increasing both the
                    volume and dissemination of geopolitical analysis,
                    reporting, and threat intelligence to better inform
                    effective responses and protection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, there have to be consequences when nation-states
                    violate international rules. While it often falls on state,
                    local, and federal governments to enforce these penalties,
                    multistakeholder action can be leveraged to strengthen and
                    extend international norms. For example, Microsoft recently
                    signed onto the European Commission's Code of Practice on
                    Disinformation along with more than 30 online businesses to
                    collectively tackle this growing challenge. Governments can
                    build on these norms and laws to advance accountability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, threat actors are only going to continue getting
                    better at evading detection and influencing public opinion.
                    The latest nation-state threats and emerging trends show
                    that threat actors will keep evolving their tactics.
                    However, there are things organizations can do to improve
                    their defenses. We just need to create holistic policies
                    that public and private entities alike can use to combat
                    digital propaganda and protect our collective operations
                    against false narratives.

                    There has been an expectation that ChatGPT could assist in
                    creating database queries, just as it can assist in creating
                    computer programs. However, creating database queries
                    requires an understanding of the database itself, and there
                    is no conventional way to represent database semantics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We present a solution to this problem by developing a set of
                    syntax that can represent database semantics, such as table
                    structure and relationships, in natural language. This
                    allows for the creation of semantic representations of
                    databases that can be understood by ChatGPT and enable it to

                    If you want a spacecraft that can explore beyond the solar
                    system—and you don't want to wait decades for it to get
                    there—you need one that can really <em>move</em>. Today's
                    chemical rockets and solar-powered probes are downright poky
                    on interstellar scales. Artur Davoyan has a completely
                    different idea for how to accelerate a spacecraft to extreme
                    speeds: pellet-beam propulsion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here's the gist of how it would work: First, you actually
                    need <em>two</em> spacecraft. A probe blasts off on a
                    one-way trip to deep space, while a second vehicle remains
                    locked in an Earth orbit and fires thousands of tiny
                    metallic pellets at its partner every second. The orbiting
                    craft also either fires a 10-megawatt laser beam at the
                    retreating probe, or aligns a laser fired from the ground at
                    it. The laser hits the pellets, heats them, and ablates
                    them, so that part of their material melts and becomes
                    plasma—a hot cloud of ionized particles. That plasma
                    accelerates the pellet remnants, and this pellet beam
                    provides thrust to the spacecraft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Alternatively, Davoyan thinks the probe could get thrust
                    from the pellet beam if the craft were to deploy an on-board
                    magnetic field-generating device to deflect the pellets. In
                    this case, that magnetic action would push the craft
                    forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such a system could boost a 1-ton probe to speeds up to
                    300,000 miles per hour. That's slow compared to the speed of
                    light, but more than 10 times faster than conventional
                    propulsion systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's a theoretical concept, but realistic enough that <a
                      href="https://www.wired.com/story/its-not-sci-fi-nasa-is-funding-these-mind-blowing-projects/"
                      >NASA's Innovative Advanced Concepts program</a
                    >
                    has given Davoyan's group $175,000 to show that the
                    technology is feasible. "There's rich physics in there,"
                    says Davoyan, a mechanical and aerospace engineer at UCLA.
                    To create propulsion, he continues, "you either throw the
                    fuel out of the rocket or you throw the fuel <em>at</em> the
                    rocket." From a physics perspective, they work the same:
                    Both impart momentum to a moving object.

                    Globalization is over, at least for the chip industry, and
                    this will mean higher chip prices, according to
                    semiconductor contract manufacturer giant TSMC. Despite
                    this, the company's founder said he supports US actions to
                    slow the development of China's chip technology.

                    The Taiwanese chip company is caught up in the ongoing
                    semiconductor battle between the superpowers, where the US
                    is trying to prevent China from getting access to cutting
                    edge technology that might be used by its burgeoning
                    military. At least, that is the reason given.

                    At an event hosted by Taiwan's CommonWealth Magazine in
                    Taipei, retired TSMC founder Morris Chang said that efforts
                    to contain China were leading to a split in the global
                    supply chain that would likely increase prices and could
                    have an effect on chip availability.

                    "There's no question in my mind that, in the chip sector,
                    globalization is dead. Free trade is not quite that dead,
                    but it's in danger," Chang said.

                    Xeon W9-3495X processor cooled down using liquid nitrogen is
                    a monumental achievement. Yet, it remains to be seen what
                    makers of boutique factory-overclocked extreme workstations
                    manage to squeeze out of this CPU with a production-grade
                    cooling system and guaranteed long-term stability.

                    projecting the camera's focused live view image into the
                    user's eye. The low-power laser projection is designed to
                    effectively bypass the focusing of the eye, helping users
                    with visual impairments like shortsightedness,
                    farsightedness, or astigmatism see a clear image.

                    It uses Sony's existing DSC-HX99 compact camera, which is a
                    somewhat middling model from 2018 with an 18-megapixel
                    sensor and equivalent zoom lens of 24-720mm (30x
                    magnification), combined with QD Laser's Retissa Neoviewer
                    projector. According to

                      >QD Laser's specs</a
                    >, the Retissa Neoviewer uses an RGB semiconductor laser to
                    display an image with an equivalent of 720p resolution and
                    8-bit color depth. This beamed image has an approximate
                    60-degree horizontal field of view with 60Hz refresh, and
                    the housing's battery has an estimated four hours of battery
                    life. Tragically, it charges via Micro USB instead of USB-C.

                    Remember Second Life? The virtual world launched on the
                    desktop web back in 2003 with 3D avatars and spaces for
                    various social activities. Believe it or not, it has been
                    running continually this entire time—and now it's coming to
                    mobile for the first time.

                  <p>
                    In fact, this will be the first time that Second Life has
                    expanded beyond the PC (across Windows, macOS, and Linux) in

                    [...] Another interesting thing going on here is how people
                    expect that the robots want to be "fed" trash and recycling:

                        Occasionally, people thought the robots expected trash
                        from them and felt obligated to give the robots
                        something. As the robot passed and stopped by the same
                        person for the second time, she said: "I guess it knows
                        I've been sitting here long enough, I should give it
                        something." Some people would even find an excuse to
                        generate trash to "satisfy" and dismiss the trash barrel
                        by searching through a bag or picking rubbish up off the
                        floor.

                    [...] I wonder how much of this social interaction is
                    dependent on the novelty of meeting the trash barrel robots
                    for the first time, and whether (if these robots were to
                    become full-time staff) humans would start treating them
                    more like janitors. I'm also not sure how well these robots
                    would do if they were autonomous. If part of the magic comes
                    from having a human in the loop to manage what seems like
                    (but probably aren't) relatively simple human-robot
                    interactions, turning that into effective autonomy could be
                    a real challenge.

                    Yet in countless ways, scientists have done just that. In
                    some cases, the reasons for this have been well-meaning
                    ones, as with the priority to diversify the populations
                    involved in medical studies. In other cases, scientists have
                    carelessly allowed social views of race to influence
                    research that could otherwise have had a solid empirical
                    foundation. Finally, true believers in racial essentialism
                    have always twisted scientific results to support their
                    views.

                    The NIH, as the largest funder of biomedical research on the
                    planet, has been forced to navigate our growing
                    understanding of genetics while trying to diversify both the
                    researchers it funds and the participants who volunteer to
                    be part of these studies. NIH thus commissioned the National
                    Academies to generate this report, presumably in the hope it
                    would provide evidence-based guidelines on how to manage the
                    sometimes competing pressures.

                  <p>
                    The resulting report makes clear why racial thinking needs
                    to go. A summary of the mismatch between <em>race</em> and
                    <em>science</em> offers welcome clarity on the problem:

                      <p>
                        In humans, race is a socially constructed designation, a
                        misleading and harmful surrogate for population genetic
                        differences, and has a long history of being incorrectly
                        identified as the major genetic reason for phenotypic
                        differences between groups. Rather, human genetic
                        variation is the result of many forces—historical,
                        social, biological—and no single variable fully
                        represents this complexity. The structure of genetic
                        variation results from repeated human population mixing
                        and movements across time, yet the misconception that
                        human beings can be naturally divided into biologically
                        distinguishable races has been extremely resilient and
                        has become embedded in scientific research, medical
                        practice and technologies, and formal education.

                    The results of racial thinking are problematic in a variety
                    of ways. Historically, we've treated race as conveying some
                    essential properties, and thinking of populations in terms
                    of race tends to evoke that essentialist perspective—even
                    though it's clear that any population has a complicated
                    mixture of genetic, social, and environmental exposures.
                    Essentialist thinking also tends to undermine recognition of
                    the important role played by those environmental and social
                    factors in shaping the population.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The report also notes that science's racial baggage leads to
                    sloppy thinking. Scientists will often write in broad racial
                    terms when they're working with far more specific
                    populations, and they'll mention racial groups even when
                    it's not clear that the information is even relevant to
                    their results. These tendencies have grown increasingly
                    untenable as we've gotten far better at directly measuring
                    the things that race was meant to be a proxy for, such as
                    genetic distance between individuals.

                    Even if the White House selects a new nominee in the next
                    few weeks, it could take months for them to be vetted and
                    confirmed by the Senate. If the White House drags its feet
                    in finding a replacement, Biden could be without a fifth
                    commissioner when the 2024 election season begins. "The FCC
                    deadlock, now over two years long, will remain so for a long
                    time," Sohn said in a statement announcing her withdrawal

                    democracy when dominant industries, with assistance from

                    left his hands tied — putting states in charge of issuing
                    their own patchwork rules.

                  <p>
                    Other parts of Biden's agenda have suffered the same
                    problem, including ones that are facing looming deadlines.

                    His 2021 infrastructure package required the agency to craft
                    rules that would ensure all Americans, despite income
                    status, have equal access to the internet. The agency has
                    until November to draft these new digital discrimination
                    rules, but civil rights groups fear it may be impossible to
                    roll out meaningful protections without a third
                    commissioner.

                    "If advanced, the rule could hold broadband providers liable
                    if their practices result in less internet access for people
                    of color and low income communities, even if companies don't
                    intentionally discriminate," the Leadership Conference on
                    Civil and Human Rights said in a February statement on the
                    rulemaking. "Without a fully functioning FCC, that rule is
                    likely to be much weaker."

                    Without clocks or modern tools, ancient Mexicans watched the
                    sun to maintain a farming calendar that precisely tracked
                    seasons and even adjusted for leap years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before the Spanish arrival in 1519, the Basin of Mexico's
                    agricultural system fed a population that was
                    extraordinarily large for the time. Whereas Seville, the
                    largest urban center in Spain, had a population of fewer
                    than 50,000, the Basin, now known as Mexico City, was home
                    to as many as 3 million people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To feed so many people in a region with a dry spring and
                    summer monsoons required advanced understanding of when
                    seasonal variations in weather would arrive. Planting too
                    early, or too late, could have proved disastrous. The
                    failure of any calendar to adjust for leap-year fluctuations
                    could also have led to crop failure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Though colonial chroniclers documented the use of a
                    calendar, it was not previously understood how the Mexica,
                    or Aztecs, were able to achieve such accuracy. New UC
                    Riverside research, published in the Proceedings of the
                    National Academy of Sciences, demonstrates how they did it.
                    They used the mountains of the Basin as a solar observatory,
                    keeping track of the sunrise against the peaks of the Sierra
                    Nevada mountains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We concluded they must have stood at a single spot, looking
                    eastwards from one day to another, to tell the time of year
                    by watching the rising sun," said Exequiel Ezcurra,
                    distinguished UCR professor of ecology who led the research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To find that spot, the researchers studied Mexica
                    manuscripts. These ancient texts referred to Mount Tlaloc,
                    which lies east of the Basin. The research team explored the
                    high mountains around the Basin and a temple at the
                    mountain's summit. Using astronomical computer models, they
                    confirmed that a long causeway structure at the temple
                    aligns with the rising sun on Feb. 24, the first day of the
                    Aztec new year.

                    Shares of Baidu fell as much as 10 percent on Thursday after
                    the web search company showed only a pre-recorded video of
                    its AI chatbot Ernie in the first public release of China's
                    answer to ChatGPT.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Beijing-based tech company has claimed Ernie will remake
                    its business and for weeks talked up plans to incorporate
                    generative artificial intelligence into its search engine
                    and other products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But on Thursday, millions of people tuning in to the event
                    were left with little idea of whether Baidu's chatbot could
                    compete with ChatGPT.<br />[...]<br />"We can only explore
                    by ourselves. Training ChatGPT took OpenAI more than a year,
                    and it took them another year to tune GPT-4," said one Baidu
                    employee. "It means we're two years behind."

                    Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

                    The leading explanation for the origin of the moon proposes

                    (<em>SN: 5/2/22; SN: 6/5/19; SN: 1/2/18</em>). Yuan and his
                    colleagues chose to focus on two continent-sized blobs of
                    material in Earth's lower mantle known as

                    >
                    (<em>SN: 5/12/16</em>). These are regions through which
                    seismic waves are known to move anomalously slow.
                    Researchers had previously proposed these regions could have
                    formed from old, subducted plates<em>.</em> But in 2021,
                    Yuan and colleagues alternatively proposed that the
                    mysterious masses could be the dense, sunken

                    [...] While the simulations suggest the large low-shear
                    velocity provinces could have had a hand in starting
                    subduction, it's not yet clear whether these masses came
                    from Theia. "The features ... are a fairly recent
                    discovery," says geodynamicist Laurent Montési of the
                    University of Maryland in College Park. "They're very
                    fascinating structures, with a very unknown origin." As
                    such, he says, it's too early to say that Theia triggered
                    plate tectonics.

                  <p>
                    "It's provoking. This material down there is something
                    special," Montési says of the large low-shear velocity
                    provinces. "But whether it has to be originally
                    extraterrestrial, I don't think the case is made."

                    A data center about the size of a washing machine is being
                    used to heat a public swimming pool in England.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Data centers' servers generate heat as they operate, and
                    interest is growing in finding ways to harness it to cut
                    energy costs and offset carbon emissions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this latest example, the computing technology has been
                    placed inside a white box and surrounded by oil, which
                    captures the heat before being pumped into a heat exchanger,
                    according to a
                    <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64939558"
                      >BBC report</a
                    >.

                  <p>
                    The setup is effective enough to heat a council-run swimming
                    pool in Exmouth, about 150 miles west of London, to about 86
                    degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) for about 60% of the
                    time, saving the operator thousands of dollars. And with
                    energy costs rising sharply in the U.K., and councils
                    looking for ways to save money, an initiative like this
                    could be the difference between the pool staying open and
                    closing down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Behind the idea is U.K.-based tech startup Deep Green. In
                    exchange for hosting its kit, Deep Green installs free
                    digital boilers at pools and pays for the energy that they
                    use. Meanwhile, tech firms pay Deep Green to use its
                    computing power for various artificial intelligence and
                    machine learning projects.

                    Qualcomm on Monday began an attempt to convince the European
                    Union's Court of Justice that it should not pay a €242
                    million ($258 million) fine imposed on it for
                    anti-competitive behavior.

                    against the US chipmaker in 2019. At the time, the European
                    Commission found that Qualcomm had sold 3G baseband chipsets
                    at a loss to harm British rival Icera's ability to compete.

                    [...] In order to prevent Nvidia-controlled Icera from
                    claiming a larger slice of the market, the European
                    Commission says Qualcomm began selling its UMTS chipsets to
                    the likes of Huawei and ZTE at prices its rival couldn't
                    match.

                  <p>
                    [...] The European Commission ultimately smacked Qualcomm
                    with a €242 million fine for its behavior. As Qualcomm's
                    profits reached $12.9 billion last year, the fine is
                    significant but not very damaging.

                  <p>
                    Qualcomm is nevertheless trying to avoid paying the fine. In

                    that Qualcomm Attorney, Miguel Rato claimed the European
                    Commission was on a "crusade" against the company. Rato also
                    called into question the basis for the Commission's
                    argument, arguing the specific market for 3G baseband chips
                    accounted for less than a percent of the overall UMTS market
                    at the time.

                    for anticompetitive behavior over the past few years, the

                    WR 124 was actually one of the first observations made by
                    JWST in June 2022, the space agency said, but the image has
                    been unveiled just now. The Wolf-Rayet phase is a brief
                    condition some stars go through during their lifetime before
                    turning into supernovae, which makes Webb's observations a
                    valuable asset to astronomers studying the life of stars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    WR 124 is 30 times the mass of our Sun, NASA said, and it
                    has "shed" 10 Suns' worth of material so far. The ejected
                    gas moves away from the central body and cools down, forming
                    cosmic dust and glowing in the infrared light that is
                    detectable by Webb's advanced instruments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Before Webb, astronomers investigating cosmic dust
                    simply had no way to capture detailed images and information
                    about a dust-rich environment like the WR 124 nebula. And
                    dust, NASA said, plays an essential role in the inner
                    working of the universe as it shelters forming stars, and
                    gathers together to help shape planets, molecules and even
                    the building blocks of life on Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dust is a fundamental element for our universe, and yet
                    scientists still have to explain why the universe seemingly
                    contains more dust than our current dust-formation theories
                    can justify. The universe is "operating with a dust budget
                    surplus," NASA remarked.

                    [...] In the new study, Deisseroth and his colleagues used a
                    light attached to a tiny vest over a mouse's genetically
                    engineered heart to change the animal's heart rate. When the
                    light was off, a mouse's heart pumped at about 600 beats per
                    minute. But when the team turned on a light that flashed at
                    900 beats per minutes, the mouse's heartbeat followed suit.
                    "It's a nice reasonable acceleration, [one a mouse] would
                    encounter in a time of stress or fear," Deisseroth explains.

                    When the mice felt their hearts racing, they showed
                    anxiety-like behavior. In risky scenarios — like open areas
                    where a little mouse might be someone's lunch — the rodents
                    slunk along the walls and lurked in darker corners. When
                    pressing a lever for water that could sometimes be coupled
                    with a mild shock, mice with normal heart rates still
                    pressed without hesitation. But mice with racing hearts
                    decided they'd rather go thirsty.

                    eventually factor into how doctors treat panic and anxiety,
                    Beyeler says. But the path between the lab and the clinic,
                    she notes, is much more convoluted than that of the heart to
                    the head.

                    It's not clear when lawmakers might get around to moving on
                    the issue, if ever, although Biden could issue an executive
                    order for parts of it.

                  <p>
                    [...] So, what does all this have to do with Microsoft?
                    Plenty. The feds have made clear they believe Microsoft has
                    a long way to go before it meets basic cybersecurity
                    recommendations. At least one top government security
                    official has already publicly called out Microsoft for poor
                    security practices.
                  </p>

                      >recently criticized the Microsoft during a speech at
                      Carnegie Mellon University</a
                    >. She said that only about one-quarter of Microsoft
                    enterprise customers use multifactor authentication, a
                    number she called "disappointing." That might not sound like
                    much of a condemnation, but remember, this is the federal
                    government we're talking about. It parses its words very
                    carefully. "Disappointing" to them is the equivalent of
                    "terrible job" anywhere else.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Even without laws and executive orders, the company
                    could be in trouble. The US government spends billions of
                    dollars on Microsoft systems and services every year, a
                    revenue stream that could be endangered if Microsoft doesn't
                    adhere to the standards.
