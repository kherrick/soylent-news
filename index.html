                  <p>
                    Wealthy owners of Rum treated this island as a shooting and
                    fishing estate for more than a century and kept most people
                    away from what became known as the "Forbidden Isle" during
                    the late 19th- to early 20th-century.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Kinloch castle was built by the textile tycoon George
                    Bullough in 1897, his wife, Lady Monica wanted to grow roses
                    in the garden. To facilitate this and generally improve the
                    landscape, Bullough imported 250,000 tonnes of good-quality
                    Ayrshire soil to spread around their new home. They lived in
                    this castle for just six weeks each year, but this human
                    opulence changed the underground ecosystem significantly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The imported soil contained earthworms and this invertebrate
                    community around the castle at Kinloch grew. Now, 12 species
                    of earthworms—ones that prefer neutral pH soils—are present
                    at high abundance (200 worms per square metre).
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2004.04.001"
                      >Colleagues and I sampled at 50m intervals</a
                    >
                    in altitude from here (at sea level) up to the summit of a
                    steep, rocky peak called Hallival. Our research showed that
                    this earthworm species richness and abundance ends abruptly
                    at the wall around the estate—the limit of the imported
                    soil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As well as human influences, natural processes can affect
                    soil properties. On the slopes of Rum's peaks, many patches
                    of bright green vegetation can be found among the rocks at
                    elevations from 500-800m. These so-called "shearwater
                    greens" are the result of nesting Manx shearwaters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pairs of these black and white seabirds burrow into the
                    hillside to raise one chick each year, before beginning
                    their long-distance migration towards South America. The
                    verdant shearwater greens are
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2012.07.004"
                      >fertilized from above by the feces</a
                    >
                    of the adult birds before they fly off to forage for small
                    fish such as herring and sprat to feed their chicks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More nutrient-rich feces from the digested fish are also
                    produced by the chicks in the burrow below ground, so soil
                    enrichment is from a marine source. This supports grass
                    growth and more earthworms—the same three species found on
                    the moorland, but in much greater numbers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On low-lying moorland, fenced plots keep deer away from
                    trees that were planted in the 1950s and 1960s, just after
                    Rum became a national nature reserve. Now, these protected
                    trees provide roosts for songbirds, and the soil beneath
                    them is rich with earthworms as the tree leaf litter adds
                    nutrients to the soil. These plots have triggered a
                    small-scale reafforestation project which could change this
                    island landscape, its soils and its many earthworms.

                    [...] A digital-only console is a trap, a last gasp from
                    Phil Spencer as he tries to boost the sales of Xbox's
                    underperforming service. When a company is happy to acquire
                    countless enormous game studios only to lay off swathes of
                    the workforce (<a
                      href="https://www.thegamer.com/geoff-keighley-finally-acknowledged-game-industry-layoffs-worst-way/"
                      >thanks, Geoff, for finally mentioning that</a
                    >, by the way), it's clearly being mismanaged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For years, Xbox was a footnote on Microsoft's expenses list,
                    but now it's spending billions of dollars on acquiring
                    studios, it's under a lot more scrutiny. The worst case
                    scenario is that you invest in the Xbox plantation, only for
                    Microsoft to pull the plug on the whole thing. Your games,
                    unavailable. Your console, bricked. It seems hyperbolic but
                    recent years of games being pulled from existence sets a
                    precedent. At some point, it could happen to an entire
                    ecosystem.

                    The horse transformed human history—and now scientists have
                    a clearer idea of when humans began to transform the horse.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Around 4,200 years ago, one particular lineage of horse
                    quickly became dominant across Eurasia, suggesting that's
                    when humans started to spread domesticated horses around the
                    world, according to research
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07597-5"
                      >published Thursday in the journal <i>Nature</i></a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There was something special about this horse: It had a
                    genetic mutation that changed the shape of its back, likely
                    making it easier to ride.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In the past, you had many different lineages of horses,"
                    said Pablo Librado, an evolutionary biologist at the Spanish
                    National Research Council in Barcelona and co-author of the
                    new study. That genetic diversity was evident in ancient DNA
                    samples the researchers analyzed from archaeological sites
                    across Eurasia dating back to 50,000 years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But their analysis of 475 ancient horse genomes showed a
                    notable change around 4,200 years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's when a specific lineage that first arose in what's
                    known as the Pontic-Caspian Steppe, a plains region that
                    stretches from what is now northeastern Bulgaria across
                    Ukraine and through southern Russia, began to pop up all
                    across Eurasia and quickly replaced other lineages. Within
                    three hundred years, the horses in Spain were similar to
                    those in Russia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We saw this genetic type spreading almost everywhere in
                    Eurasia—clearly this horse type that was local became global
                    very fast," said co-author Ludovic Orlando, a molecular
                    archaeologist at the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics
                    of Toulouse in France.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Researchers believe the very earliest horse ancestors
                    arose in North America, then sauntered across the Bering
                    Strait into Asia around a million years ago. They flourished
                    in Asia, but went extinct in the Americas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    People had domesticated other animals several thousand years
                    before horses—including dogs, pigs, cattle, goats and sheep.
                    But the new research shows that the shrinking genetic
                    diversity associated with domestication happened much faster
                    in horses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Humans changed the horse genome stunningly quickly, perhaps
                    because we already had experience dealing with animals,"
                    said Laurent Frantz, who studies the genetics of ancient
                    creatures at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and
                    was not involved in the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It shows the special place of horses in human societies."

                    bacteria, fungi or parasites. That includes chronic health
                    problems such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue
                    syndrome (ME/CFS) and Lyme-associated chronic illnesses.

                    According to the National Academies’ definition, long COVID
                    is a medical condition that persists for at least three
                    months after an infection with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus
                    that causes COVID-19. Long COVID can affect any organ or
                    system in the body. People may have any of more than 200
                    symptoms, which may include difficulty breathing,

                    and autoimmune diseases such as lupus (<em>SN: 2/2/22</em>;
                    <em>SN: 8/21/23</em>; <em>SN: 1/4/22</em>). Those symptoms
                    can appear alone or in multiple combinations, can be
                    continuous, get progressively worse or have bouts in which
                    the patient gets better and then worse again.

                    Chronic symptoms can affect people who originally had mild
                    to severe COVID and can even strike people who didn’t have
                    any symptoms at all from their original infection. For that
                    reason, the committee that crafted the Academies’ definition
                    says that people don’t need to have had a positive COVID
                    test to be diagnosed with long COVID.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The condition can strike adults and children and can start
                    weeks or months after seeming recovery from the initial
                    infection. The committee didn’t put an upper limit on how
                    long after getting the original illness that long COVID
                    could start.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are no blood tests or biomarkers that doctors can use
                    to reliably diagnose long COVID right now. The report calls
                    for continued research to find such diagnostic tools.

                    This definition follows a June 5 report that the Social
                    Security Administration asked the National Academies to
                    prepare. That report similarly found that

                    New Hampshire officials issued two warnings of potentially
                    dangerous algae blooms along parts of Lake Winnipesaukee,
                    the state's largest lake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services said
                    on Thursday it detected high concentrations of
                    cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, at Carry and
                    Brewster beaches in Wolfeboro and at 19-Mile Bay and
                    Tuftonboro Neck in Tuftonboro the previous day.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Visitors should avoid contact with the water and keep pets
                    away, the department advised in a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cyanobacteria blooms are occurring as green clouds of
                    material accumulating along shorelines. In some areas, they
                    appear more yellow because they are mixed in with dense
                    pollen, the department said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Symptoms of cyanobacteria exposure can include skin
                    irritation, stomach cramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea,
                    fever, sore throat, headache, muscle and joint pain, mouth
                    blisters and acute liver damage, the department said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The affected areas will be resampled on June 19 and
                    resampling will continue weekly if the bloom continues, the
                    department said.

                    Usable engineering data began to be returned later in April,
                    and in May the mission team sent commands to instruct the
                    probe to keep science data flowing. The result was that the
                    plasma wave subsystem and magnetometer instrument began
                    sending data immediately. According to NASA, the cosmic ray
                    subsystem and low energy charged particle instrument
                    required a little more tweaking but are now operational.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rescue was made all the more impressive by the fact that
                    it takes 22.5 hours for a command to reach Voyager 1 and
                    another 22.5 hours for a response to be received on Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    How much longer the Voyagers can continue to function is
                    open to conjecture. The power supplies are gradually
                    degrading, and engineers have been turning off non-essential
                    systems to eke out dwindling resources for as long as
                    possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due the engineers' efforts, there is a very good chance that
                    one or both Voyagers will continue to be operational by the
                    time the 50th anniversary of the mission's launch rolls
                    around in 2027.

                    NASA confirmed that Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft
                    has suffered a fifth, although minor, helium leak in its
                    propulsion system as engineers work to prepare the vehicle
                    for its return to Earth next week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a June 10 statement, NASA mentioned that spacecraft teams
                    were examining "what impacts, if any, five small leaks in
                    the service module helium manifolds would have on the
                    remainder of the mission." That was the first reference to
                    there being five leaks in the spacecraft; NASA had mentioned
                    there were four in a briefing hours after the spacecraft's
                    June 6 docking with the International Space Station.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] NASA closed the helium manifolds in the propulsion
                    system after docking to stop the leaks, although they will
                    have to be opened to use the spacecraft's thrusters for
                    undocking and deorbit maneuvers. NASA said June 10 that
                    engineers estimate that Starliner has enough helium to
                    support 70 hours of flight operations, while only seven
                    hours is needed for Starliner to return to Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Those teams have some time to complete that work. NASA
                    had initially scheduled a June 14 undocking for Starliner,
                    but NASA said June 9 it was delaying the undocking to no
                    earlier than June 18. That delay was to avoid a conflict
                    with a June 13 ISS spacewalk, or EVA, by NASA astronauts
                    Tracy Dyson and Matt Dominick.

                    A groundbreaking cancer treatment developed by NUS
                    researchers utilizes engineered bacteria to deliver
                    chemotherapy drugs directly to tumor sites, significantly
                    enhancing treatment efficacy and reducing side effects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Traditional chemotherapy frequently presents substantial
                    difficulties, such as harsh side effects, harm to healthy
                    cells, and restricted effectiveness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National
                    University of Singapore (NUS Medicine), have pioneered a
                    groundbreaking cancer treatment method. This new technique
                    offers a more precise, potent, and less harmful alternative
                    to conventional chemotherapy. It not only enhances the
                    efficacy of the treatment but also substantially lowers the
                    dosage of drugs needed for cancer therapy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Prodrugs are inactive molecules that transform into
                    active drugs within the body, particularly in tumor
                    environments, by leveraging unique tumor conditions, such as
                    low oxygen or high acidity, to activate the drug precisely
                    at the cancer site, minimizing damage to healthy tissues.
                    However, current prodrug strategies exhibit limited target
                    specificity and frequently depend on macromolecular
                    carriers, which complicates both drug distribution and
                    clearance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To overcome these limitations, NUS Medicine researchers
                    developed a prodrug delivery method that utilizes a
                    commensal <em>Lactobacillus</em> strain that binds
                    specifically to cancer cells via a surface molecule called
                    heparan sulfate. These engineered bacteria carry a prodrug
                    that converts to the chemotherapy drug SN-38 at the tumor
                    site. In preclinical models of nasopharyngeal cancer, the
                    engineered bacteria localized specifically in the tumor and
                    released the chemotherapy drug directly at the cancer site,
                    reducing tumor growth by 67% and increasing the
                    effectiveness of the chemotherapy drug by 54%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “Cancer treatment often takes a tremendously heavy
                    toll on patients. Our research represents a significant step
                    toward developing a more targeted and less toxic approach to
                    fighting cancer. We hope this can pave the way for therapies
                    that are both mild and effective,” added A/Prof Chang,

                    codebases, Google didn't upgrade users from the old app to
                    the new app. They lived on the Play Store as separate apps,
                    both called "Google Pay," and for a while, it was possible
                    to download and install both apps on your device. A big use
                    case for the app was P2P payments, but money sent via the
                    new app didn't arrive on the old app, and vice versa, so for
                    months of the transition, Google Pay just wasn't a reliable
                    money-sending service that
                    <a href="https://x.com/RonAmadeo/status/1407131954521255940"

                    could figure out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google often feels like a disorganized company with
                    constantly shifting priorities, and a big reason behind that
                    is the lack of top-down initiatives from the CEO. That means
                    the real driving force behind most projects at Google are
                    mid-level executives who show up with grand plans and then
                    leave—either in disgrace or triumph—when those initial plans
                    run their course. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Lost in all of this app shuffling is that Google
                    supposedly has no P2P payments system now. Wallet only
                    supports tap-to-pay, gift cards, and driver's licenses—it
                    doesn't have a way to send money to friends, family, or
                    anybody else. This worked fine on Google Pay before Google
                    blew everything up. Now, it is presumably ceding that market
                    to apps like Venmo and Zelle, though it's hard to imagine
                    anyone sticking with Google's payment app after the
                    confusing and broken transition.

                    is aligned with the grid—the [battery-swap companies] have

                    put the VPP stations to the test—but also showed the
                    system's strength. On April 15, 12 days after the initial
                    earthquake, the grid in Taiwan was still recovering from the
                    damage when another power drop happened. This time, 818
                    Gogoro locations reacted in five seconds, reducing power
                    consumption by 11 megawatts for 30 minutes.

                    Numbers like 6 MW and 11 MW are "not a trivial amount of
                    power but still substantially smaller than a centralized
                    power plant," says Joshua Pearce, an engineering professor
                    at Western University in Ontario, Canada. For comparison,
                    Taiwan lost 3,200 MW of power supply right after the April
                    earthquake, and the gap was mostly filled by solar power,
                    centralized battery storage, and hydropower. But the entire
                    Taiwanese VPP network combined,

                    maintain stability during disasters. The more smart loads
                    there are on the grid, the more resilient it is," he says.

                    not been fully achieved yet; the majority of the stations

                    In most modern vehicles, these systems are “passive” in that
                    they don’t physically slow a speeding vehicle. A
                    notification may pop up if you’re going more than a few
                    miles per hour over the speed limit, but it won’t physically
                    limit your ability to speed. Active ISA systems will
                    physically slow your vehicle to keep you at the speed limit.
                    Some use tactile responses, like pushing the accelerator
                    back into your foot, while others actively limit the engine
                    power to keep you at the speed limit. These active systems
                    can be turned on and off by the driver.

                    [...] While conflicts around speed limiters are not new,
                    they have certainly become more deeply ingrained, thanks in
                    part to the covid-19 pandemic and political division.
                    According to Adkins, speeding got worse when everyone was
                    forced to stay home. “The people that were out, were
                    speeding, they were way more aggressive because they knew
                    they had the space, and they knew they could get away with
                    it,” he said.

                    [...] While Americans love the freedom to drive where they
                    want, as fast as they want, a study released today from the
                    Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows that consumers
                    may be more open to technology like ISA than previously
                    thought. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Ian Reagan, a senior research scientist at the
                    institute who designed the survey, more than 60 percent of
                    the 1,800 drivers who participated said they would be open
                    to some form of passive ISA system in new cars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even more surprising was that 50 percent of those surveyed
                    said they’d be open to active ISA, including tech that makes
                    the accelerator pedal harder to press or automatically
                    restricts speed. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety data
                    notes that drivers would have the option to turn any active
                    ISA system on and off as they see fit, making the technology
                    only useful if it’s accepted and utilized by drivers.

                    While this is a small bright spot when it comes to
                    potentially reducing speed-related accidents on US roads,
                    there is still a long way to go. After all, it took nearly
                    50 years of advocacy from groups like Mothers Against Drunk
                    Driving to stigmatize driving under the influence. And it
                    took nearly that long for drivers to get on board with
                    wearing their seatbelts. “I think we’ll get there,” Adkins
                    said, “but it’s going to take some time, and we have to do
                    this thoughtfully.”

                    3D printing has made manufacturing more affordable,
                    especially for low-volume production. However,

                    are often huge and heavy devices that need a stable platform
                    to work properly — until now.

                    that its researchers have worked closely with a team from
                    the University of Texas at Austin to create a prototype 3D
                    printer that is smaller than a coin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This photonic chip focuses its beam into a resin well that
                    rapidly cures when it’s hit by a particular wavelength of
                    light emitted from the chip. The palm-sized 3D printer also
                    saves space by eschewing moving parts — instead of using
                    arms and motors to change the beam’s focal point, the
                    prototype uses tiny optical antennas to move it around and
                    create the desired shape.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the team is successful in turning this concept into a
                    viable product, it could change the face of instant
                    manufacturing. The portability and speed of this palm-sized
                    printer could allow anyone — engineers, doctors, or even
                    first responders — to create solutions on the fly without
                    needing to lug around a big and heavy device.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These are just some of the exciting possibilities that
                    this 3D printing concept brings to the table. According to
                    MIT Professor Jelena Notaros, “This system is completely
                    rethinking what a 3D printer is. It is no longer a big box
                    sitting on a bench in a lab creating objects, but something
                    that is handheld and portable. It is exciting to think about
                    the new applications that could come out of this and how the
                    field of 3D printing could change.”

                    The Tharsis volcanoes, a string of 12 large peaks, are the
                    tallest volcanoes in our solar system, according to the
                    study, which notes that the water frost was discovered on
                    the volcanoes Olympus, Arsia Ascraeus Mons, and Ceraunius

                    Following the strongest solar storm in twenty years, NASA’s
                    ICESat-2 satellite was put into a safe hold on May 10 due to
                    atmospheric drag from the expanded atmosphere. Recovery
                    actions have since raised its orbit, with operations

                    The lidar instrument on NASA’s ICESat-2 satellite is
                    scheduled to resume collecting data around June 17, after
                    going into a safe hold on May 10 due to impacts from the
                    strongest solar storm to hit Earth in two decades. The storm
                    did not cause any detectable damage to the satellite or its

                    were released from the Sun and sparked a geomagnetic storm
                    at Earth that caused our planet’s atmosphere to expand in
                    places. This created unexpected drag on ICESat-2, rotating
                    the satellite, and triggering the satellite to enter safe
                    hold, which turned off ICESat-2’s science instrument.

                    The ICESat-2 team has conducted two thruster burns to raise
                    the spacecraft’s altitude, allowing it to now drift back to
                    its normal orbit around 310 miles (500 kilometers) above
                    Earth. Once there, the team will return the Advanced
                    Topographic Laser Altimeter System instrument to science
                    mode, to continue measuring the height of Earth’s ice,

                    ICESat-2, short for Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation
                    Satellite-2, is a NASA satellite mission designed to measure
                    ice sheet elevation and sea ice thickness, as well as land
                    topography and vegetation characteristics. Launched in
                    September 2018, the satellite employs a sophisticated laser
                    altimeter system called ATLAS (Advanced Topographic Laser
                    Altimeter System) to provide precise and detailed
                    measurements of Earth’s surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ICESat-2’s high-resolution data helps scientists understand
                    changes in ice sheets, glaciers, and sea ice that result
                    from climate change, enhancing our ability to accurately
                    predict future sea level rise and assess changes in Earth’s
                    ecosystems. This satellite is a critical tool in NASA’s
                    Earth Observing System, contributing valuable data for
                    environmental research and climate science.

                    Unfortunately for big ISPs, legal history hasn’t been in
                    their favor. This particular debate has wound through the
                    legal system several times now, and each time the courts
                    have ruled that the FCC has the legal right to reclassify
                    broadband and impose net neutrality under the Telecom Act —
                    provided they provide hard data supporting their decisions.

                    Microsoft isn't just making Recall opt-in either. The
                    company also announced that in order to enable Recall, users
                    will have to enroll in Windows Hello, a security feature
                    that requires users to sign in via facial recognition,
                    fingerprint, or a PIN.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That same authentication will be required for a user to
                    access or search through their Recall history timeline as
                    well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Plus, Microsoft says it's "adding additional layers of data
                    protection." Recall snapshots will only be decrypted and
                    accessible after a user authenticates. The search index
                    database will also now be encrypted too.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft's blog post about the Recall security update also
                    runs through a number of security-related provisions that
                    were already built in, such as the screenshots only being
                    available locally on the device. The feature already
                    provided imagery to show it was being used – a Recall icon
                    pinned to the taskbar on a user's desktop. However, many
                    users would've likely been unaware of what the icon meant if
                    Recall had just been on as a default.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new opt-in option should hopefully make it crystal clear
                    that a user is consenting to what Recall does.

                  <p>
                    Someone recently asked an interesting question: Why do
                    Microsoft C and compatible DOS compilers have no truncate()
                    and/or ftruncate() library functions? And how does one
                    resize files on DOS?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    OK, that's actually two questions. The first one is easy
                    enough to answer: Because XENIX had no truncate() or
                    ftruncate() either. Instead, XENIX had a chsize() function
                    which, sure enough, can be found in the Microsoft C
                    libraries at least as far back as MS C 3.0 (early 1985).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second question is rather more interesting. The way
                    files are resized on DOS is moving the file pointer to the
                    desired size by calling the LSEEK function (INT 21h/42h),
                    and then calling the WRITE function (INT 21h/40h) with zero
                    length (CX=0).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, this mechanism is rather curious, because the
                    handle-based file API in DOS 2.0 was modeled on XENIX, yet
                    on UNIX systems, the write() function asked to transfer zero
                    bytes simply does nothing. If the mechanism didn't come from
                    XENIX, where did it come from?....

                    The researchers analyzed vocalizations - mostly rumbles
                    generated by elephants using their vocal cords, similar to
                    how people speak - made by more than 100 elephants in
                    Amboseli National Park and Samburu National Reserve.

                    Using a machine-learning model, the researchers identified
                    what appeared to be a name-like component in these calls
                    identifying a specific elephant as the intended addressee.
                    The researchers then played audio for 17 elephants to test
                    how they would respond to a call apparently addressed to
                    them as well as to a call apparently addressed to some other
                    elephant.

                    O-negative is the type that can be given to anyone, known as
                    the universal blood type.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is used in emergencies or when a patient's blood type is
                    unknown.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Air ambulances and emergency response vehicles carry O
                    negative supplies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Just 8% of the population have type O negative but it makes
                    up for around 15% of hospital orders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    O-positive is the most common blood type, 35% of donors have
                    it, and it can be given to anybody with any positive blood
                    type. This means three in every four people, or 76% of the
                    population, can benefit from an O positive donation.

                    This National Blood Week it has been revealed that three
                    blood donations are needed every minute in hospitals and
                    there are about 13,000 appointments available nationally
                    this week in NHS Blood Donor Centres with 3,400 available in

                A very interesting article about programming Robots, written by
                BENJIE HOLSON:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    I worked on this idea for months before I decided it was a
                    mistake. The second time I heard someone mention it, I
                    thought, "That's strange, these two groups had the same
                    idea. Maybe I should tell them it didn't work for us." The
                    third and fourth time I rolled my eyes and ignored it. The
                    fifth time I heard about a group struggling with this
                    mistake I decided it was worth a blog post all on its own. I
                    call this idea "The Mythical Non-Roboticist".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea goes something like this: Programming robots is
                    hard. And there are some people with really arcane skills
                    and PhDs who are really expensive and seem to be required
                    for some reason. Wouldn't it be nice if we could do robotics
                    without them?1 What if everyone could do robotics? That
                    would be great, right? We should make a software framework
                    so that non-roboticists can program robots.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This idea is so close to a correct idea that it's hard to
                    tell why it doesn't work out. On the surface, it's not
                    wrong: all else being equal, it would be good if programming
                    robots was more accessible. The problem is that we don't
                    have a good recipe for making working robots. So we don't
                    know how to make that recipe easier to follow. In order to
                    make things simple, people end up removing things that folks
                    might need, because no one knows for sure what's absolutely
                    required. It's like saying you want to invent an
                    invisibility cloak and want to be able to make it from
                    materials you can buy from Home Depot. Sure, that would be
                    nice, but if you invented an invisibility cloak that
                    required some mercury and neodymium to manufacture would you
                    toss the recipe?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In robotics, this mistake is based on a very true and very
                    real observation: programming robots is super hard. Famously
                    hard. It would be super-great if programming robots was
                    easier. The issue is this: programming robots has two
                    different kinds of hard parts.

                    [...] As with the earlier find, there seem to be two
                    possible explanations for the ASKAP source. One is a neutron
                    star that's still managing to emit radiofrequency radiation
                    from its poles despite rotating extremely slowly. The second
                    is a white dwarf that has a reasonable rotation period but
                    an unreasonably strong magnetic field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To get at this issue, the researchers estimate the strength
                    of the magnetic field needed to produce the larger bursts
                    and come up with a value that's significantly higher than
                    any previously observed to originate on a white dwarf. So
                    they strongly argue for the source being a neutron star.
                    Whether that argues for the earlier source being a neutron
                    star will depend on whether you feel that the two objects
                    represent a single phenomenon despite their somewhat
                    different behaviors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In any case, we now have two of these mystery slow-repeat
                    objects to explain. It's possible that we'll be able to
                    learn more about this newer one if we can get some
                    information as to what's involved in its mode switching. But
                    then we'll have to figure out if what we learn applies to
                    the one we discovered earlier.

                    At first we were wondering whether these options would be
                    enabled by default before the new release. We did not have
                    to wait long. This

                    Microsoft is revamping how Recall works amid its PR
                    nightmare<br />By<br />Rich Woods
                  </p>
                  <p>Key Takeaways</p>
                  <p>
                            -Microsoft promised groundbreaking features with
                    Copilot+, including Cocreator and Live Captions, but Recall
                    has become a PR nightmare.<br />
                            -Concerns about Recall being a security risk have
                    led to backlash and panic among users due to data access
                    vulnerabilities.<br />
                            -Microsoft has been silent on Recall issues but is
                    finally taking action to address the security concerns and
                    ensure user control.

                  <p>
                    One of the key complaints about Recall is that it was
                    opt-out. In the setup experience, Windows just tells you
                    that it's on, and lets you check a box to open settings
                    after setup is complete. Now, you'll have to choose to turn
                    it on during the out-of-box experience, so it's totally
                    opt-in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Secondly, you'll have to use Windows Hello in order to turn
                    on Recall. The idea is that in order to access it, Windows
                    will have to know it's you.<br />
                      Finally, Windows is going to use just-in-time decryption,
                    meaning everything will be encrypted until you've been
                    authenticated. Microsoft also confirmed that it's encrypted
                    the search index database, which was one of the key
                    call-outs in the report from earlier this week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft also noted that all Copilot+ PCs are Secured-core,
                    so they're designed to be secure. They have Microsoft Pluton
                    security chips, so there's hardware-level protection going
                    on there.<br />

                And, all of this makes sense because we know that security chips
                can't be hacked, because they are secure chips, right? /sarcasm

                Oh yeah, the data never leaves your PC. Unless, of course, you
                do a backup to the cloud, right? In which case your data may be
                in Sri Lanka, Timbuktu, Israel, or, maybe even Ireland. And,
                police forces in third world banana republics never get warrants
                for whatever might be on the server.

                The best thing Microsoft can do with CoPilot, is to deep six it.
                Better yet, deep six all of their "telemetry" along with
                CoPilot.

                It isn't favorable to the car companies, which (historically) is

                I tried it on a 10 year old car and it pretty much matched what
                I expected -- no Wi-Fi, no linking to phones, but possible data
                collected if satellite radio was used (it's not).

                Then there is this, provided for curiosity only, since sex and
                SN users are not typically intersecting sets (grin):

                    Of all the data that car companies can potentially capture,
                    one of the most eye-opening from the Mozilla report was
                    people having sex in vehicles. "One of the things that
                    everybody latched onto was Nissan and Kia saying they could
                    collect information on your sex life or your sexual
                    activity," Caltrider said. "That really freaked people out."
                    While the researchers couldn't determine exactly how the
                    automakers would gather data on sexual activity in cars, the
                    educated guess is it wouldn't be that hard for cameras and
                    sensors to gather the information necessary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After the Mozilla Foundation report was released, Kia
                    Connect Services (a suite of services Kia extends to its
                    vehicle owners) and Nissan USA removed wording about
                    collecting information on sexual activity from their online
                    privacy policies, Caltrider said. She sent us a PDF of the
                    original wording on the Nissan site, and under Types of
                    Personal Data collected, it read: "Sensitive personal
                    information, including ... sexual orientation, sexual
                    activity, precise geolocation, health diagnosis data, and
                    genetic information." On Kia's broader corporate privacy
                    page under Sensitive Personal Information as of press time,
                    it still read, "This category may include ... sex life or
                    sexual orientation information."

                Historically, high-speed rail travel by
                <i>Train a Grande Vitesse</i> (TGV) in France was the monopoly
                of the French national rail service, SNCF.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under EU rules, all national operators have to make their rail
                system available to other willing operators. So in 2021,
                Trentalia, a unit of Italy's state rail operator, decided to
                offer high-speed train rides in France too.

                Proxima, backed by a (French) private equity firm (Antin
                Infrastructure Partners) to the initial tune of $1.1bn.

                Proxima will offer high-speed rail trips between Paris and four

                    last 10 years, reflecting new ways of living. High-speed
                    rail is the answer favored by the French, and train
                    occupancy levels are at all-time highs.

                    As France's first independent high speed train operator,
                    Proxima aims to reinvent the experience for its different

                    the changes in consumer behaviour and changing ways of life.
                    These include trends to teleworking and the erosion of the

                It might be noteworthy that earlier this year, the EU decided to
                speed-up the implementation of the TEN-T network. The TEN-T is
                an EU-wide network of rail, inland waterways, short-sea shipping
                routes, and roads. It connects 424 major cities with ports,
                airports and railway terminals. When the TEN-T is complete, it
                will cut travel times between these cities. For example,
                passengers will be able to travel between Copenhagen and Hamburg
                in 2.5 hours by train, instead of the 4.5 hours required today.

                    During an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,
                    comedian Larry David explained that his New Year's
                    Resolution was "make two trips" (episode 857, January 8,
                    2020).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, when carrying groceries into the house, it is
                    tempting to carry everything at once, but then you drop the
                    cantaloupe, and now you have to clean up that mess. While it
                    seemed like one trip would have been faster, if you include
                    the time it takes to clean up the mess, it would have been
                    faster to simply make two trips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This "make two trips" strategy isn't an
                    earth-shattering breakthrough. It won't cure cancer, end
                    world hunger, or fix the climate crisis. However, I have
                    adopted this philosophy, and it has had many benefits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The immediate benefit is that I am now more likely to have a
                    free hand to open my house door. Pulling keys out of my
                    pocket no longer involves smashing a grocery bag between my
                    chest and the house.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The larger benefit has come from adopting this philosophy in
                    both coding and operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The other day, I was adding a feature to some old code. The
                    code reported results of an earlier calculation with various
                    formatting options that could be enabled or disabled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The code was quite complex because certain options affected
                    the format in ways that had downstream implications for
                    other options. The code was able to satisfy all the various
                    options and controls in one pass over the data, printing a
                    report along the way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I struggled in earnest to add my new feature to this
                    ever-growing complicated loop.
                  </p>
                  <p>Then I remembered Larry's advice: Make two trips.</p>
                  <p>
                    The code would be significantly simpler if it made two
                    passes over the data. One pass would collect data, count
                    things that needed to be counted, sum subtotals, and so on.
                    The second pass would take all this information and output
                    the report, and would be much easier because it had all the
                    information it needed from the start. No Schrödinger's cat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It was a classic complexity vs. memory engineering
                    decision: Suffer from complexity or suffer from potential
                    memory exhaustion.

                You might just be in luck, as MIT Press has released an impact
                report about its Direct-To-Open (D2O) program, under which
                faculty members do not publish with pay-for-play journals and
                publishers anymore, but release [some of] their good stuff
                directly to the public.

                    To date, D2O has funded 240 books: 159 in the humanities and
                    social sciences (HSS) and 81 in science, technology,
                    engineering, art/design, and mathematics (STEAM). The data
                    show that, on average, open-access HSS books in the program
                    are used 3.75 times more and receive 21 percent more
                    citations than their paywalled counterparts. Open-access
                    books in STEAM fields are used 2.67 times more and receive
                    15 percent more citations than their non-open counterparts,
                    on average. Regardless of their field, D2O books are making
                    meaningful contributions to debates both within and beyond
                    the academy.

                    Programming style is not a matter of efficiency in a
                    program. It is a matter of how easy it is to write or read a
                    program, how easy it is to explain the program to someone
                    else, how easy it is to figure out what the program does a
                    year after you've written it; and above all, style is a
                    matter of taste, of aesthetics, of what you think looks
                    nice, of what you think is elegant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although style is mainly a matter of taste, a programmer
                    with a "good" style will find his programs easy to write,
                    easy to read, and easy to explain to others. ...

                  <p>
                    In particular, you may have acquired special programming
                    tricks that you are very fond of, and that aren't used by
                    other programmers, but that don't make your programs much
                    more efficient. I urge you to stop using those tricks. As
                    Samuel Johnson once said, "Read over your compositions, and
                    when you meet with a passage which you think is particularly
                    fine, strike it out."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In other words, make your style simple, not complicated,
                    even though the complicated style may seem to have some
                    abstract virtues. ...

                So contestants from all over the world can gather and compete
                for the title of "Miss AI".
              </p>
              <p>
                Excerpt from RT:<br />------------------<br />The event, called
                'Miss AI', is being organized by the World AI Creator Awards
                (WAICA) in collaboration with Fanvue – an OnlyFans-like
                subscription-based platform that already hosts a number of
                virtual models, including those who offer adult content.
              </p>
              <p>
                The digital contestants hoping to secure the Miss AI crown will
                be judged on their beauty, underlying tech, as well as their
                social media pull, according to WAICA's official website. The AI
                creator's "social media clout" will also be assessed based on
                their engagement numbers with fans, rate of audience growth, and
                ability to utilize social media platforms such as Instagram.<br />---------------------

                I don't quite know what to make of this. There are so many
                viewpoints and I hope to see what others feel about it. One
                thing, it's an inevitable outcome of combining our technology
                and artistic expression, even done on ancient cave walls. Soon
                our digital presence can be tailored to anything we want it to
                be. Work from home. Zoom calls ( with your AI proxy, of course,
                which would handle as many simultaneous interactions as your
                server technology can handle ).

                    comprehensive asset assessment to test their usage

                Interested in a career selling virtual meatballs at IKEA? I
                guess it's some kind of gimmick between IKEA and Roblox but it
                seems somewhat weird, selling virtual products in a virtual
                world to people. Is this the future of employment?

                    These decryption keys were uncovered by the FBI after a
                    massive joint operation disrupted LockBit earlier this year,
                    though the gang appears to still be operational.

                  <p>
                    The US FBI has revealed that it has more than 7,000
                    decryption keys to help victims of the notorious LockBit
                    ransomware gang.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These decryption keys were recovered by the FBI as a result
                    of a
                    <a

                    international law enforcement conducted against LockBit
                    earlier this year. This gang provides
                    ransomware-as-a-service to a global network of ‘affiliates’,
                    giving criminals tools to carry out their own cyberattacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In February, the joint operation managed to take down
                    LockBit’s data leak website and managed to uncover a large
                    amount of data about the gang and its activities.
                    Authorities also seized the decryption keys that the FBI is
                    now offering to victims.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a recent statement, the FBI’s cyber assistant director
                    Bryan Vorndran claimed LockBit was the most deployed
                    ransomware variant in the world by 2022 and that the gang
                    has caused “billions of dollars in damages to victims”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “We are reaching out to known LockBit victims and
                    encouraging anyone who suspects they were a victim to visit
                    our Internet Crime Complaint Center,” Vorndran said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Raj Samani, SVP and chief scientist at Rapid7, said
                    the release of these decryption keys is “another kick in the
                    teeth” for the LockBit gang and “a great win for law
                    enforcement”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The likes of LockBit survive and thrive on victims paying
                    ransom demands, therefore, it’s great to see the US
                    government be proactive and prevent this by releasing the
                    decryption keys for free,” Samani said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Ever since law enforcement took down LockBit’s
                    infrastructure in February 2024, they’ve engaged in PR and
                    damage control in order to show strength and maintain the
                    confidence of affiliates. However, such announcements by the
                    FBI damages this confidence, and hopefully we’ll soon see
                    the end of the LockBit ransomware group.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not everyone is so optimistic however. Ricardo Villadiego,
                    the founder and CEO of cybersecurity firm Lumu, told
                    SiliconRepublic.com recently that gangs such as LockBit are

                      >prepared for these potential risks</a
                    > – evident by the fact that the gang was offering its
                    services again in “less than four days”.

                    While most algorithms operate near perfectly on their own,
                    Peter Grantcharov explains that the OR black box is still
                    not fully autonomous. For example, it's difficult to capture
                    audio through ceiling mikes and thus get a reliable
                    transcript to document whether every element of the surgical
                    safety checklist was completed; he estimates that this
                    algorithm has a 15% error rate. So before the output from
                    each procedure is finalized, one of the Toronto analysts
                    manually verifies adherence to the questionnaire. "It will
                    require a human in the loop," Peter Grantcharov says, but he
                    gauges that the AI model has made the process of confirming
                    checklist compliance 80% to 90% more efficient. He also
                    emphasizes that the models are constantly being improved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In all, the OR black box can cost about $100,000 to install,
                    and analytics expenses run $25,000 annually, according to
                    Janet Donovan, an OR nurse who shared with
                    <em>MIT Technology Review</em> an estimate given to staff at
                    Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital in Massachusetts.
                    (Peter Grantcharov declined to comment on these numbers,
                    writing in an email: "We don't share specific pricing;
                    however, we can say that it's based on the product mix and
                    the total number of rooms, with inherent volume-based
                    discounting built into our pricing models.")
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] At some level, the identity protections are only half
                    measures. Before 30-day-old recordings are automatically
                    deleted, Grantcharov acknowledges, hospital administrators
                    can still see the OR number, the time of operation, and the
                    patient's medical record number, so even if OR personnel are
                    technically de-identified, they aren't truly anonymous. The
                    result is a sense that "Big Brother is watching," says
                    Christopher Mantyh, vice chair of clinical operations at
                    Duke University Hospital, which has black boxes in seven
                    ORs. He will draw on aggregate data to talk generally about
                    quality improvement at departmental meetings, but when
                    specific issues arise, like breaks in sterility or a cluster
                    of infections, he will look to the recordings and "go to the
                    surgeons directly."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In many ways, that's what worries Donovan, the Faulkner
                    Hospital nurse. She's not convinced the hospital will
                    protect staff members' identities and is worried that these
                    recordings will be used against them—whether through
                    internal disciplinary actions or in a patient's malpractice
                    suit. In February 2023, she and almost 60 others sent a
                    letter to the hospital's chief of surgery objecting to the
                    black box. She's since filed a grievance with the state,
                    with arbitration proceedings scheduled for October.

                    for nearly a year and a half now, following the late 2022
                    release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But despite transformative
                    effects on companies’ share prices, generative AI tools
                    powered by large language models (LLMs) still have major
                    drawbacks that have kept them from being as useful as many
                    would like them to be. Retrieval augmented generation, or
                    RAG, aims to fix some of those drawbacks.

                    (also called “hallucination”), which is a statistical
                    gap-filling phenomenon AI language models produce when they
                    are tasked with reproducing knowledge that wasn’t present in
                    the training data. They generate plausible-sounding text
                    that can veer toward accuracy when the training data is
                    solid but otherwise may just be completely made up.

                    Relying on confabulating AI models gets people and companies
                    in trouble, as we’ve covered in the past. In 2023, we saw

                    [...] “RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence
                    by blending the LLM process with a web search or other
                    document look-up process” to help LLMs stick to the facts,
                    according to Noah Giansiracusa, associate professor of
                    mathematics at Bentley University.

                  <p>
                    [...] Although RAG is now seen as a technique to help fix
                    issues with generative AI, it actually predates ChatGPT.
                    Researchers coined the term in
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401"
                      >a 2020 academic paper</a
                    >
                    by researchers at Facebook AI Research (FAIR, now Meta AI
                    Research), University College London, and New York
                    University.

                  <p>
                    As we've mentioned, LLMs struggle with facts. Google’s entry
                    into the generative AI race, Bard,
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/in-paris-demo-google-scrambles-to-counter-chatgpt-but-ends-up-embarrassing-itself/"
                      >made an embarrassing error</a
                    >
                    on its first public demonstration back in February 2023
                    about the James Webb Space Telescope. The error wiped around
                    $100 billion off the value of parent company Alphabet. LLMs
                    produce the most statistically likely response based on
                    their training data and don’t understand anything they
                    output, meaning they can present false information that
                    seems accurate if you don't have expert knowledge on a
                    subject.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    LLMs also lack up-to-date knowledge and the ability to
                    identify gaps in their knowledge. “When a human tries to
                    answer a question, they can rely on their memory and come up
                    with a response on the fly, or they could do something like
                    Google it or peruse Wikipedia and then try to piece an
                    answer together from what they find there—still filtering
                    that info through their internal knowledge of the matter,”
                    said Giansiracusa.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But LLMs aren’t humans, of course. Their training data can
                    age quickly, particularly in more time-sensitive queries. In
                    addition, the LLM often can’t distinguish specific sources
                    of its knowledge, as all its training data is blended
                    together into a kind of soup.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In theory, RAG should make keeping AI models up to date far
                    cheaper and easier. “The beauty of RAG is that when new
                    information becomes available, rather than having to retrain
                    the model, all that’s needed is to augment the model’s
                    external knowledge base with the updated information,” said
                    Peterson. “This reduces LLM development time and cost while
                    enhancing the model’s scalability.”

                    MDMA, sometimes called Molly or ecstasy, has been banned in
                    the United States for more than three decades. Now this
                    potent mind-altering drug is poised to become a badly needed
                    therapy for PTSD.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On June 4, the Food and Drug Administration's advisory
                    committee will meet to discuss the risks and benefits of
                    MDMA therapy. If the committee votes in favor of the drug,
                    it could be approved to treat PTSD this summer. The approval
                    would represent a momentous achievement for proponents of
                    mind-altering drugs, who have been working toward this goal
                    for decades. And it could help pave the way for FDA approval
                    of other illicit drugs like psilocybin. But the details
                    surrounding how these compounds will make the transition
                    from illicit substances to legitimate therapies are still
                    foggy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, for drugs that carry a risk of serious side
                    effects, the FDA can add a risk evaluation and mitigation
                    strategy to its approval. For MDMA that might include
                    mandating that the health-care professionals who administer
                    the medication have certain certifications or specialized
                    training, or requiring that the drug be dispensed only in
                    licensed facilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, Spravato, a nasal spray approved in 2019 for
                    depression that works much like ketamine, is available only
                    at a limited number of health-care facilities and must be
                    taken under the observation of a health-care provider.
                    Having safeguards in place for MDMA makes sense, at least at
                    the outset, says Matt Lamkin, an associate professor at the
                    University of Tulsa College of Law who has been following
                    the field closely.: "Given the history, I think it would
                    only take a couple of high-profile bad incidents to
                    potentially set things back."

                    What mind-altering drug is next in line for FDA approval?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Psilocybin, a.k.a. the active ingredient in magic mushrooms.
                    This summer Compass Pathways will release the first results
                    from one of its phase 3 trials of psilocybin to treat
                    depression. Results from the other trial will come in the
                    middle of 2025, which—if all goes well—puts the company on
                    track to file for approval in the fall or winter of next
                    year. With the FDA review and the DEA rescheduling, "it's
                    still kind of two to three years out," Nath says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some states are moving ahead without formal approval. Oregon
                    voters made psilocybin legal in 2020, and the drug is

                    there at about 20 licensed centers for supervised use. "It's
                    an adult use program that has a therapeutic element," says
                    Ismail Ali, director of policy and advocacy at the

                    While initially this looked like good news, almost three
                    months later, this has turned into a complete and utter
                    disaster.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the past months, the Linux Kernel team has issued
                    thousands of CVE identifiers, with the vast majority being
                    for trivial bug fixes and not just security flaws.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Just in May alone, the Linux team issued over 1,100 CVEs,
                    according to

                    Ironically, this was a disaster waiting to happen, with the

                    <a
                      href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/2024021314-unwelcome-shrill-690e@gregkh/"

                    for issuing CVEs right after the moment it received its CNA
                    status.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We say weird because they are quite unique among all CNAs.
                    The Linux kernel team argues that because of the deep layer
                    where the kernel runs, bugs are hard to understand, and
                    there is always a possibility of them becoming a security
                    issue later down the line. Direct quote below:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        "Note, due to the layer at which the Linux kernel is in
                        a system, almost any bug might be exploitable to
                        compromise the security of the kernel, but the
                        possibility of exploitation is often not evident when
                        the bug is fixed. Because of this, the CVE assignment
                        team is overly cautious and assign CVE numbers to any
                        bugfix that they identify. This explains the seemingly
                        large number of CVEs that are issued by the Linux kernel
                        team."
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    [...] Instead, the Linux Kernel team appears to have adopted
                    a simpler approach where it puts a CVE on everything and
                    lets the software and infosec community at large confirm
                    that an issue is an authentic security flaw. If it's not,
                    it's on the security and vulnerability management firms to
                    file CVE revocation requests with the precise Linux Kernel
                    team that runs the affected component.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new Linux CNA rules also prohibit the issuance of CVEs
                    for bugs in EOL Linux kernels, which is also another weird
                    take on security. Just because you don't maintain the code
                    anymore, that doesn't mean attackers won't exploit it and
                    that people wouldn't want to track it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Linux team will also refuse to assign CVEs until a patch
                    has been deployed, meaning there will be no CVEs for
                    zero-days or vulnerabilities that may require a longer
                    reporting and patching timeline.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And if this isn't bad enough, the Linux kernel team
                    appears to be
                    <a
                      href="https://mastodon.social/@cadey@pony.social/112507861868449128"

                    >
                    for fixes to last year's code, generating even more noise
                    for people who use CVEs for legitimate purposes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Unfortunately, all of this CVE spam also could have
                    not happened at a worse time. Just as the Linux Kernel team
                    was getting its CNA status, NIST was

                    its management of the NVD database—where all CVEs are
                    compiled and enriched.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NIST cited a staff shortage and a sudden rise in the number
                    of reported vulnerabilities—mainly from the IoT space.
                    Having one of every fifth CVE being a Linux non-security bug
                    isn't helping NIST at all right now.

                    In a burnished-oak corridor outside the committee room at
                    IBM's headquarters in August 1980, two engineers pace
                    nervously. Eventually, a door opens. Their boss, Bill Lowe,
                    emerges from the board room next door. Before they can say
                    anything, he smiles and nods. They laugh. They can't quite
                    believe it. It's official. IBM is going to try and build a
                    home computer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bill Lowe kicked off this ambitious project, but he wouldn't
                    be the person who would finish it. That role would fall to
                    his successor, a humble, cowboy boot-wearing mid-level
                    executive, out of favor and kicking his heels in the IBM
                    corporate backwater of Boca Raton, Florida. He would take
                    Lowe's project forward, one nobody else in the company
                    wanted. Just 12 months later, on August 15, 1981, a computer
                    would launch that would change the world: the IBM PC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is the story of Don Estridge, the man who brought the
                    IBM PC to market and changed business and home computing
                    forever. In just five years he created an IBM division that
                    almost nobody else in the company wanted to exist. By 1983,
                    it had seized 70 percent of the microcomputer market and was
                    valued at over $4 billion ($12 billion today). Under
                    Estridge, IBM's PC division sold over 1 million machines a
                    year, making it the third largest computer manufacturer in
                    the world on its own. This story is based on contemporary
                    accounts in publications such as InfoWorld, PC magazine,
                    Time, and the New York Times, as well as books such as Blue
                    Magic by James Chposky and Ted Leonsis; Big Blues by Paul
                    Carroll; and Fire in the Valley by Michael Swaine and Paul
                    Frieberger.

                    A study carried out by the University of Helsinki's DogRisk
                    research group, the University of Eastern Finland and Wise
                    Nose – Scent Discrimination Association in Finland
                    investigated the threshold for scent detection in dogs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study revealed that dogs can learn to identify
                    concentrations of eucalyptus hydrolate that are clearly
                    below the detection threshold of sophisticated analytical
                    instruments used today. The concentrations were also far
                    below previously reported levels. Dogs' extraordinary sense
                    of smell can be exploited, for example, in search and rescue
                    operations and in medical detection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 15 dogs that participated in the study had different
                    training backgrounds. Some dogs had experience of nose work,
                    which is a hobby and competitive dog sport, while some had
                    been trained to identify diseases, mould or pests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the study, the dogs were to differentiate samples
                    containing low concentrations of eucalyptus hydrolate from
                    samples containing only water. The focus was on determining
                    the lowest concentration that the dogs could detect for
                    certain. The study included three different tests where the
                    concentrations of the hydrolate were diluted gradually until
                    the dogs could no longer identify the scent. This determined
                    the threshold for their scent detection ability.

                  <p>
                    "The dogs' scent detection threshold initially varied from
                    1:10⁴–1:10²³ but narrowed down to 1:10¹⁷–1:10²¹ after a
                    training period. In other words, the dogs needed 1 to 10
                    molecules per millilitre of water to detect the right
                    sample. For perspective, a single yeast cell contains 42
                    million molecules," describes the principal investigator of
                    the study, Anna Hielm-Björkman from the University of
                    Helsinki.

                    The indigenous Marubo people, who for hundreds of years have
                    existed in small huts along the Itui River in the Amazon,
                    were connected to the billionaire's satellite network in
                    September.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The community embraced the technology, marvelling at the
                    life-saving ability to call for immediate help when
                    grappling with venomous snake bites as well as being able to
                    remain in contact with faraway relatives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, since a group of men arrived at the camp with antennas
                    strapped to their backs to connect the remote tribe of 2,000
                    people to the internet, there have been some less desirable
                    consequences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Critics warn tribe members have become "lazy", reclining in
                    hammocks all day glued to their phones to gossip on WhatsApp
                    or chat to strangers on Instagram.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And there have already been reports of young men engaging in
                    aggressive sexual behaviour after being exposed to
                    pornography, Alfredo Marubo, leader of a Marubo association
                    of villages, told The New York Times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Young men brought up in a culture where kissing in public is
                    seen as scandalous have been sharing explicit videos with
                    one another in group chats, he said, adding: "We're worried
                    young people are going to want to try it."<br />...<br />Kâipa
                    Marubo, a father of three, said he was concerned about his
                    children playing first-person shooter video games, fearing
                    they might want to mimic the attacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another leader, Enoque Marubo, 40, said the tribe has
                    started limiting the hours members could access the internet
                    because its introduction had "changed the routine so much
                    that it was detrimental".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Members can browse the internet for two hours in the morning
                    and five hours in the afternoon and all day on Sundays.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In the village, if you don't hunt, fish and plant, you
                    don't eat," Enoque said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Enoque worked with Brazilian activist Flora Dutra to bring
                    the internet to the tribe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They contacted American philanthropist Allyson Reneau, who
                    reportedly donated 20 Starlink units to the Marubo tribe.

                I wonder what ads they'll be shown based on their geolocation?
                Given how fast they learn, it shouldn't take long to figure out
                that content creation could be more lucrative than just
                consumption. Does Amazon deliver WebCams and lights in the

                    The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission
                    have reached a deal that clears the way for potential
                    antitrust investigations into the dominant roles that
                    Microsoft (MSFT.O), OpenAI and Nvidia (NVDA.O) , play in the
                    artificial intelligence industry, according to a source
                    familiar with the matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The agreement between the two agencies shows regulatory
                    scrutiny is gathering steam amid concerns over concentration
                    in the industries that make up AI. Microsoft and Nvidia not
                    only dominate their industries but are also the world's two
                    biggest companies by market capitalization.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The move to divvy up the industry mirrors a similar
                    agreement between the two agencies in 2019 to divide
                    enforcement against Big Tech, which ultimately saw the FTC
                    bring cases against Meta (META.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O), and
                    the DOJ sue Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) for alleged
                    violations. Those cases are ongoing and the companies have
                    denied wrongdoing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While OpenAI's parent is a nonprofit, Microsoft has invested
                    $13 billion in a for-profit subsidiary, for what would be a
                    49% stake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Justice Department will take the lead in investigating
                    whether Nvidia violated antitrust laws, while the FTC will
                    examine the conduct of OpenAI and Microsoft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The regulators struck the deal over the past week, and it is
                    expected to be completed in the coming days, the person
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nvidia has roughly 80% of the AI chip market, including the
                    custom AI processors made by the cloud computing companies
                    like Google, Microsoft and Amazon.com. That domination helps
                    the company report gross margins between 70% and 80%.

                    A multi-institutional team of plant specialists,
                    microbiologists and paleontologists in the Czech Republic
                    and the University of Minnesota, in the U.S., has found
                    evidence of a hot spring oasis during the last ice age in a
                    part of central Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In their
                    <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ado6611"
                      >study</a
                    >, reported in the journal <i>Science Advances</i>, the
                    group found and analyzed bits of leaves, wood and pollen in
                    the area around a modern freshwater spring.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Environmental scientists have long suggested that temporary
                    hot springs in parts of Europe may have helped trees and
                    other types of plants survive during the last ice age, but
                    there has been little evidence to prove the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this new effort, the research team ventured to freshwater
                    springs in the Vienna Basin looking for evidence of ancient
                    plant life. They suspected an oasis could have existed in
                    the area during the last ice age, as the weight of glaciers
                    sliding down the nearby Alps set off tectonic activity,
                    releasing geothermally heated water from deep within the
                    Earth's crust.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The release of warm water, the researchers reasoned, would
                    have formed an oasis, keeping the ground around the hot
                    springs warm enough for trees and other plants to survive
                    even though they would have been surrounded by ice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During their search, the research team found bits of wood,
                    pollen and fossilized bits of leaves from trees that should
                    not have been able to survive in the area during the last
                    ice—yet, they were dated to between 19,000 and 26,000 years
                    ago, a span of time that correlated to the last ice age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The findings strongly support the presence of an oasis
                    during the last ice age—one that helped some types of trees
                    survive despite the cold.
