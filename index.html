                <div>
                  <p>
                    [...] The farmed mink in Poland again highlight the risk of
                    spillbacks by suggesting an unknown reservoir of SARS-CoV-2
                    in wild animals. In an investigation, researchers at
                    National Veterinary Research Institute and Erasmus
                    University Medical Centre looked into cases at three farms
                    within 8 km (about 5 miles) of each other. The first farm
                    reported two infected mink (out of 15 tested and about 8,650
                    animals total) on September 19, but they subsequently tested
                    negative and were pelted as scheduled. On November 16, a
                    second farm with 4,000 mink reported six infected animals
                    out of 15 tested, and they were pelted with precautions. The
                    third farm, with 1,100 mink, found 15 infected animals out
                    of 15 tested on January 18, but they subsequently tested
                    negative in two rounds of testing within 50 days. All of the
                    infected animals on the three farms were asymptomatic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers obtained eight whole genome sequences—four
                    each from the second and third farms; there wasn't enough
                    genetic material in samples from the first farm. The genome
                    sequences showed they were nearly identical and most closely
                    matched the lineage B.1.1.307, which hadn't been seen in
                    humans in Poland in over two years. The viruses also had 40
                    small genetic mutations, some of which have previously been
                    associated with circulation in mink, and could have been
                    acquired quickly. None of the farm families or workers
                    tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at any of the three farms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers noted that all three farms had concrete
                    fences 1.8 meters (6 feet) high and about 30–40 cm (around a
                    foot) deep. There was no evidence of animals burrowing under
                    the fences, but the researchers noted overhanging tree
                    branches that could have created a route for wild animals.
                    Interviews with owners and staff revealed that the farms
                    were occasionally visited by wild martens, weasel-like
                    carnivores. And there were also feral cats around. The
                    researchers tested feral cat droppings around the farms but
                    found they were negative for SARS-CoV-2.

                    3 are non-controversial (and already exist, as they're not
                    in blue text). The 4th is new, relating to security, and
                    might be abused by Verisign. But, look at the 5th item! I
                    was shocked to see this new language:

                  <p>
                    This text has a plain and simple meaning — they propose  to
                    allow "<strong>any government</strong>", "<strong

                    "<strong>court[s] of competent jurisdiction</strong>" to
                    deny, cancel, redirect, or transfer any domain name
                    registration (as I noted above, this is currently proposed 
                    for .NET, but if not rejected immediately with extreme
                    prejudice, it could also find its way into other registry
                    agreements like .COM which the abusive monopolist Verisign
                    manages).

                    space agency is no longer going alone.

                  <p>
                    This week, NASA signed a memorandum of understanding with
                    JAXA to join its upcoming mission to the two Martian moons,
                    Phobos and Deimos, which is scheduled to launch in 2024.
                    NASA has assembled a team of scientists and prepared two
                    instruments to board JAXA's spacecraft to Mars, the space

                    The Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission will not only
                    visit the two mysterious moons that whirl around Mars, it
                    will also land on the cratered surface of Phobos to snag a
                    sample from the largest of the two moons.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's an ambitious plan as no spacecraft has successfully
                    ventured to the Martian moons before, let alone land on one.
                    JAXA, however, has some experience in returning samples from
                    cosmic bodies. The Japanese space agency's Hayabusa
                    spacecraft retrieved

                    [...] The main purpose of the mission is to analyze the
                    origins of the Martian moons and determine whether they are
                    in fact captured asteroids in the Mars system or fragments
                    that coalesced together following a huge impact on the Red
                    Planet. The mission could help scientists better understand
                    how terrestrial planets like Mars form and learn more about
                    the history of the planet.

                    To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the
                    folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny
                    world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more
                    kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve
                    and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever

                    Magazines are so retro: If you are anything like me, you
                    probably remember the days when you subscribed to multiple
                    computing magazines. I still have fond memories of typing
                    out the computer programs in the back pages of some
                    publications; I even submitted a few of my own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When high-speed internet came along, many computing
                    publications began producing digital versions of their
                    magazines online. Those with subscriptions still got their
                    physical copies, but the online component was a nice perk
                    for when readers could not just pick up a magazine and start
                    reading, like at work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before long, most computing magazines had online versions
                    and, at some point, started ditching paper. It was easier
                    and cheaper to publish one copy that all subscribers could
                    access online rather than printing hundreds of thousands of
                    physical versions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The demise of print media in the computing industry
                    was inevitable. By the 2000s, many prominent magazines had
                    shut down their printing arms and switched to digital only.
                    Byte stopped printing in 1998. Windows Magazine crashed in
                    2002, and the succinctly titled PC Magazine (now PCMag)
                    published its last issue in 2009. Computer Gaming World went
                    entirely out of business with its November 2006 issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Print advertising also played a big part in the
                    decline of computer publications. Once advertisers realized
                    replicating ads on web pages was cheap and easy, they
                    gradually pulled out of print computer magazines. Many
                    physical magazine branches shut down for that reason alone.
                    If the pub didn't have the clout of names like PC Magazine,
                    Maximum PC, or PC World, it had no chance of competing
                    against the internet for ad space. Even the almanac-like
                    Computer Shopper plunged from nearly 360,000 readers in 1996
                    to about 55,000 in 2014.

                    He added: "Remarkably, 80% of the mass in the universe is
                    invisible. By mapping the dark matter distribution across
                    the sky to the largest distances, our ACT lensing
                    measurements allow us to clearly see this invisible world."

                    [...] Sherwin added, "Our results also provide new insights
                    into an ongoing debate some have called 'The Crisis in
                    Cosmology.'" This "crisis" stems from recent measurements
                    that use a different background light, one emitted from
                    stars in galaxies rather than the CMB. These have produced
                    results that suggest the dark matter was not lumpy enough
                    under the standard model of cosmology and led to concerns
                    that the model may be broken. However, the ACT team's latest
                    results precisely assessed that the vast lumps seen in this
                    image are the exact right size.

                    "While earlier studies pointed to cracks in the standard
                    cosmological model, our findings provide new reassurance
                    that our fundamental theory of the universe holds true,"

                    Cambridge graduate student as well as a former Princeton

                    general, we don't have particularly good theory for
                    understanding how to deter non-state actors. A lot of the
                    deterrence theory [has] evolved out of Cold War nuclear
                    deterrence in the USSR, USA and the West. It is not really
                    configured the same way to think about non-state actors,
                    particularly those which have very decentralized, loose
                    non-hierarchical network command structures, which don't
                    lend themselves to influencing in the same way as a

                    The situation with AI-enhanced weapons was different from
                    earlier military analysis in that the private sector is way
                    ahead of government research, which was not the case with
                    physical threats, he said.

                    calling for a pause for at least six months in the training
                    of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. Signatories included
                    Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, and

                    But the prospect of a pause was wholly unrealistic, Payne

                    rapid pace of change that people feel is coming down the
                    tracks towards them. But I don't think it is a realistic

                    The demand for privacy is so high today that tech companies
                    who were once major data retailers have rebranded themselves
                    as privacy guardians. Meta, which was infamously embroiled
                    in the Cambridge Analytica scandal and has been tied to
                    other disturbing data-mining episodes, has since promised
                    features like E2E encrypted messaging—in a bid to make
                    itself seem more privacy-friendly to users. Apple,
                    meanwhile, has made privacy one of the core tenets of its
                    brand—famously rolling out a new tagline: "Privacy. That's
                    Apple," despite glaring violations that speak to the
                    contrary.

                  <p>
                    For Yen, these efforts don't cut a lot of ice. "Big Tech is
                    not going to be incentivized—from a business model
                    perspective—to deliver the level of privacy that users
                    really expect," he said. "No matter what Zuck says, nothing
                    can change the fundamental fact that he makes money by
                    selling your data."

                    It is hard not to cherish the partnership of a slightly
                    older ThinkPad and OpenBSD. The ThinkPad X270 and OpenBSD
                    are both minimalist, robust, and customizable. Specifically,
                    the ThinkPad is minimalist with regard to features, robust
                    with regard to physical durability, and customizable with
                    regard to hardware repairability and replaceability. OpenBSD
                    is minimalist with regard to code, robust with regard to
                    security, and customizable with regard to every aspect of
                    the system. Further, since a healthy number of OpenBSD's
                    developers long have used ThinkPads (to the point that I
                    have read some jokes come out of members of their ranks like
                    'I may use any kind of laptop that I may like, as long as it
                    is a ThinkPad'), the operating system works brilliantly on
                    the laptop — both with their stock settings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, installing and configuring OpenBSD -current on the
                    ThinkPad X270 was the simplest minimalist installation of
                    any operating system on any hardware that I ever have done,
                    even simpler than Debian GNU/Linux or my beloved FreeBSD
                    (and much simpler than a proprietary, dysfunctional
                    operating system Windows or MacOS). Was the total setup
                    process easier than, say, that of a GNU/Linux distribution
                    that uses the Calamares installer and comes preconfigured
                    with a huge array of GNU/Linux drivers? Well, no, it was
                    not, but that is not the point. OpenBSD is secure, nimble,
                    and customizable in an elegantly simple way that
                    interoperates smoothly with this small ThinkPad for my
                    mobile academic research and writing. Even in this
                    topsy-turvy era in which other popular desktop operating
                    systems are have many design choices for form over function,
                    OpenBSD comes as a serious, professional product that is
                    ready to let me focus on my work.

                    Sturdy, degradable materials made from plants and other
                    non-petroleum sources have come a long way in recent years.
                    For example, cornstarch-based packing peanuts disappear
                    simply by dousing them in water, and some utensils are based
                    on polymers synthesized from plant sugars. But those packing
                    peanuts can't be used to protect anything wet, and
                    plant-derived polymers still take a long time to break down.
                    One potential alternative is a new type of rigid material
                    designed from isomalt, which is a sugar alcohol rather than
                    a polymer. With isomalt, bakers can create breathtaking, but
                    brittle, structures for desserts, and then dissolve them
                    away quickly in water. So, Scott Phillips and colleagues
                    wanted to boost the sturdiness of isomalt with natural
                    additives to create a robust material that degrades

                    The researchers heated isomalt to a liquid-like state and
                    mixed in either cellulose, cellulose and sawdust, or wood
                    flour to produce three different materials. Then, using
                    commercial plastics manufacturing equipment, the materials
                    were extruded into small pellets and molded into various
                    objects, including balls, a dodecahedron, a chess piece and
                    flower-shaped saucers. All of the tested additives doubled
                    the strength of isomalt, creating materials that were harder
                    than plastics, including poly(ethylene terephthalate) (known
                    as PET) and poly(vinyl chloride) (known as PVC), but were
                    still lightweight. In experiments, samples dissolved in
                    water within minutes. And saucers made of the material, and
                    coated with a food grade shellac and cellulose acetate,
                    withstood being immersed in water for up to seven days.
                    However, once the saucers were broken and the coating
                    cracked, they rapidly disintegrated in water. The team also
                    repeatedly crushed, dissolved and recycled both coated and
                    uncoated objects into new ones that were still as strong as
                    the original items.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers say that the material could be used for
                    food-service items and temporary décor, and then crushed and
                    sprayed with water to fall apart. But even if such items
                    were simply tossed into the trash or somehow got into the
                    environment, the slightest crack in the coating would start
                    their collapse into sugars and the plant-based additives,
                    which the researchers say might be good for soil.

                    Archaeologists have discovered the remains of an
                    1,800-year-old winery at the Villa of the Quintilii outside
                    of Rome. By the team's measure, the winery was designed as
                    much for the spectacle of wine-making as the practice
                    itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Decorated rooms around the winery appear to have hosted
                    guests who would observe the wine-making process, the
                    researchers found, and the finishes (including marble
                    floors) seem installed for appearances over practicality.
                    The team's research is published in Antiquity.

                    "Agricultural labor was romanticized by the ruling classes
                    of many ancient cultures, especially as it was often the
                    source of both their wealth and status," said Emlyn Dodd, a
                    researcher at the Institute of Classical Studies at the
                    University of London, in an Antiquity release.

                    [...] WaveOne has shown success in neural-network
                    compression of still images. In
                    <a href="https://wave-one.github.io/iframe_comparisons/"
                      >one comparison</a
                    >, WaveOne reconstructions of images were 5 to 10 times as
                    likely to be chosen over conventional codecs by a group of
                    independent users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the temporal correlation in video is much stronger than
                    the spatial correlation in an image and you must encode the
                    temporal domain extremely efficiently to beat the state of
                    the art.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "At the moment, the neural video encoders are not there
                    yet," said Yiannis Andreopoulos, a professor of data and
                    signal processing at University College London and chief
                    technology officer at
                    <a href="https://www.isize.co/">iSize Technologies</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Nonetheless, the industry appears to be moving toward
                    combining AI with conventional codecs—rather than relying on
                    full neural-network compression.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For the time being, "AI and conventional technologies
                    will work in tandem," said Andreopoulos, in part, he said,
                    because conventional encoders are interpretable and can be
                    debugged. Neural networks are famously obscure "black
                    boxes." Whether in the very long term neural encoding will
                    beat traditional encoding, Andreopoulos added, is still an
                    open question.

                    San Antonio, Texas.

                    A human safety operator will be present in the one dedicated
                    truck Kodiak is allocating to this pilot. Deliveries will
                    begin this month, according to the company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The pilot program is the latest in Kodiak's growing string
                    of paid partnerships with major carriers, and it further
                    demonstrates the startup's potential path to sustainability
                    and even profitability once it removes the human safety
                    driver from operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A spokesperson for Kodiak said the company aims to remove
                    the safety operator within the next couple of years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Kodiak says the partnership is not only emblematic of
                    how human-driven trucks and autonomous trucks can work
                    together, but it also provides a use case for autonomy as a
                    solution for moving perishable products in a timely manner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As part of the partnership, C.R. England is also
                    joining Kodiak's Partner Development Program, which is
                    Kodiak's way of working with carriers to help establish
                    autonomous freight operations and, hopefully, integrate
                    Kodiak's self-driving system into their fleet.

                    "Our intent is to be a 'one-stop shop' for customers,
                    whether they need their freight moved autonomously or not,"
                    said England.

                    To get good output from ChatGPT or another LLM, you usually
                    have to feed it several prompts. But what if you could just
                    give your AI bot a set of fairly broad goals at the start of
                    a session and then sit back while it generates its own set
                    of tasks to fulfill those goals? That's the idea behind
                    Auto-GPT, a new open-source tool that uses the OpenAI API
                    (same LLM as ChatGPT) to prompt itself, based on your
                    initial input.

                  <p>
                    We've already seen a number of Twitter users talk about how
                    they are using Auto-GPT for everything from creating
                    marketing plans to analyzing market data for investments to

                    >. Based on our hands-on experience, we can't say that it
                    always works well (we asked it to write a Windows 11 how-to
                    and the result was awful), but it's early days and some
                    tasks may work better than others.

                    If you want to try Auto-GPT on your computer, it is easy to
                    install, and while there are a few sticky points in the
                    process, we've found ways to work with them, or around them
                    to write this condensed guide on how to create your own
                    Auto-GPT AI to help you in your goals.

                    An animal bone fragment full of human-made pits hints at how
                    prehistoric people in Western Europe may have crafted
                    clothing.

                    >, researchers report April 12 in <em>Science Advances</em>.
                    They suggest that the bone fragment rested beneath animal
                    hide while an artisan pricked holes in the material,
                    possibly for seams. If so, it's the earliest-known tool of
                    its kind and predates eyed needles in the region by about
                    15,000 years.

                  <p>
                    Found at an archaeological site south of Barcelona, the
                    roughly 11-centimeter-long bone fragment contains 28
                    punctures scattered across one flat side, with 10 of them
                    aligned and fairly evenly spaced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The marks don't seem to have been a notation system or
                    decoration, given that some holes are hard to see and the
                    bone fragment wasn't otherwise shaped, says archaeologist
                    Luc Doyon of the University of Bordeaux in France. He
                    thought leatherwork could have made the marks. But it wasn't
                    until he visited a cobbler shop and saw one of the artisan's
                    tools that the hypothesis solidified, guiding Doyon's next
                    steps.

              <p>
                Europe, at least, has a climate change service to measure these
                things. As for the rest of the world, an extrapolation of the
                pattern shown in
                <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/esotc/2022/globe-in-2022"

              <p>
                To illustrate the
                <a

                of the problem, the heatwave in mid-July of 2022 was caused by
                hot air from the Sahara moving into Europe, driving temperatures
                above 40 degrees Celsius. By mid-August, a stationary
                high-pressure system with clear skies and weak winds took hold,
                and caused a second heatwave, which was made worse due to the
                soil being dried out by the mid-July event, and no rains since.
              </p>
              <p>
                Events above the Sahara might have come a second time in play,
                here. Increasing temperatures lead to a stronger evaporation
                over sea, while the land heats up more. This results in a
                stronger temperature gradient, which draws rains deeper inland:
                heavier rainfalls now are reported in the central Sahara, in
                summer, with formerly dry valleys being put under four meters of
                water. This causes less Sahara dust in the atmosphere, and hence
                shields the land less from solar radiation: the EU's report
                mentions that 2022 surface solar radiation was the highest in a
                40 year record, and part of a positive trend.
              </p>
              <p>
                To end with a positive note, the EU ain't doing so bad, compared
                to Greenland: three different heatwaves in 2022, and an average
                September temperature more than 8 degrees Celsius higher than
                normal.

                    So Cholis and Iason Krommydas of Rice University in Houston
                    analyzed positrons detected by the Alpha Magnetic
                    Spectrometer on the International Space Station. The pair
                    found an excess of positrons whose present-day energies
                    could correspond to a burst of activity from the galactic
                    center between 3 million and 10 million years ago, right
                    around when the Fermi bubbles are thought to have formed,
                    Cholis said at the meeting.

                  <p>
                    The result, Cholis said, supports the idea that the Fermi
                    bubbles came from a time when the galaxy's central black
                    hole was busier than it is today.

                  <p>
                    As of mid-August 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce's
                    Bureau of Industry and Security mandated that any company
                    planning to sell semiconductor hardware, software,
                    equipment, or any other asset using American intellectual
                    property to Huawei and its entities must obtain a special
                    export license. The export controls on Huawei mostly pertain
                    to semiconductors. However, Seagate's hard drives also fall
                    under the export-controlled items category because they use
                    controllers and memory designed with electronic design
                    automation tools developed by American companies and
                    produced using U.S.-made equipment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These export licenses were subject to a presumption of
                    denial policy, meaning they were difficult to obtain.
                    However, multiple companies were granted appropriate
                    licenses between 2020 and 2022, which allowed Huawei to
                    acquire various products that were developed or manufactured
                    in the United States.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Seagate did not apply for an appropriate license and
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/the-curious-case-of-storage-devices-and-huawei"

                    in September, 2020, that its drives could be shipped to
                    Huawei without a license, an opinion that
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/the-curious-case-of-storage-devices-and-huawei"
                      >was not shared by its rival Western Digital</a
                    >. Since Huawei was not supposed to get HDDs at all,
                    republican senator Roger Wicker

                    >
                    how exactly the sanctioned company obtained such storage
                    devices and whether three global makers of hard drives
                    complied with the export rules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As it turned out, although Toshiba and Western Digital
                    ceased to sell HDDs to Huawei, Seagate continued to do so.
                    In fact, the company became Huawei's exclusive hard drive
                    supplier and even signed a three-year Strategic Cooperation
                    Agreement and then a Long-Term Agreement to purchase over
                    five million HDDs with the Chinese conglomerate in 2021.

                    [...] The paper's contributing authors include luminaries of
                    the AI world, such as Yoshua Bengio, MILA's scientific
                    director, who is a recipient of a 2019 Turing Award,
                    computing's equivalent of the Nobel Prize. Bengio is widely
                    credited with developing the attention mechanism long before
                    Vaswani and team adapted it for the Transformer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also among the authors is Stanford University computer
                    science associate professor Christopher Ré, who has helped
                    in recent years to advance the notion of AI as

                  <p>
                    To find a sub-quadratic alternative to attention, Poli and
                    team set about studying how the attention mechanism is doing
                    what it does, to see if that work could be done more
                    efficiently.

                  <p>
                    A recent practice in AI science, known as mechanistic
                    interpretability, is yielding insights about what is going
                    on deep inside a neural network, inside the computational
                    "circuits" of attention. You can think of it as taking apart
                    software the way you would take apart a clock or a PC to see
                    its parts and figure out how it operates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One work cited by Poli and team is a set of experiments by
                    researcher Nelson Elhage of AI startup
                    <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>. Those
                    experiments take apart the Transformer programs

                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In essence, what Elhage and team found is that attention
                    functions at its most basic level by very simple computer
                    operations, such as copying a word from recent input and
                    pasting it into the output.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, if one starts to type into a large language
                    model program such as ChatGPT a sentence from Harry Potter
                    and the Sorcerer's Stone, such as "Mr. Dursley was the
                    director of a firm called Grunnings...", just typing
                    "D-u-r-s", the start of the name, might be enough to prompt
                    the program to complete the name "Dursley" because it has
                    seen the name in a prior sentence of Sorcerer's Stone. The
                    system is able to copy from memory the record of the
                    characters "l-e-y" to autocomplete the sentence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the attention operation runs into the quadratic
                    complexity problem as the amount of words grows and grows.
                    More words require more of what are known as "weights" or
                    parameters, to run the attention operation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the authors write: "The Transformer block is a powerful
                    tool for sequence modeling, but it is not without its
                    limitations. One of the most notable is the computational
                    cost, which grows rapidly as the length of the input
                    sequence increases."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the technical details of ChatGPT and GPT-4 haven't
                    been disclosed by OpenAI, it is believed they may have a
                    trillion or more such parameters. Running these parameters
                    requires more GPU chips from Nvidia, thus driving up the
                    compute cost.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To reduce that quadratic compute cost, Poli and team replace
                    the attention operation with what's called a "convolution",
                    which is one of the oldest operations in AI programs,
                    refined back in the 1980s. A convolution is just a filter
                    that can pick out items in data, be it the pixels in a
                    digital photo or the words in a sentence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Poli and team do a kind of mash-up: they take work done by
                    Stanford researcher Daniel Y. Fu and team to
                    <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=COZDy0WYGg"
                      >apply convolutional filters to sequences of words</a
                    >, and they combine that with work by scholar David Romero
                    and colleagues at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam that
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08059.pdf"
                      >lets the program change filter size on the fly</a
                    >. That ability to flexibly adapt cuts down on the number of
                    costly parameters, or, weights, the program needs to have.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The result of the mash-up is that a convolution can be

                    In a post
                    <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/mJUSiXlkKTLH5YHJvpqT6g"

                    on WeChat, Tencent Cloud revealed that "tens of thousands"
                    of its Canghai chips, which are designed to offload video
                    encode/decode for latency sensitive workloads, have been
                    deployed internally to accelerate cloud gaming and live
                    broadcasting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tencent says the Canghai chip can be paired with GPUs from a
                    variety of vendors to support low-latency game streaming.
                    When used for video transcoding, Tencent said a single node
                    equipped with Canghai can deliver up to 1,024 video channels
                    . We'll note that Nvidia, with the launch of its L4 GPUs
                    last month, made similar

                    >. Without real-world benchmarks, it's hard to say how
                    either firm's claims stack up.

                  <p>
                    [...] When it comes to spinning custom chips to improve the
                    efficiency and economics of cloud computing, Amazon Web
                    Services gets a lot of credit. The American e-tail giant and
                    cloud titan has developed everything from custom CPUs, AI
                    training and inference accelerators, and smartNICs to
                    offload many housekeeping workloads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And while Google has developed an accelerator of its own,
                    called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), most US cloud
                    providers have largely stuck with commercially available
                    parts from the likes of Intel, AMD, Ampere, Broadcom, or
                    Nvidia, rather than designing their own.

                  <p>
                    However, in China, custom chips appear to be more prevalent,

                    in mice for the first time. These hair cells are found in
                    the cochlear region of ears in all mammals. They sense sound
                    vibrations, convert those into brain signals, and eventually
                    allow a person to hear and understand the different sounds
                    around them. The new study from URMC researchers sheds light
                    on the underlying mechanism that allowed the ear hairs to
                    regrow in mice."

                    Another former Meta worker who recounted a similar story is
                    35-year-old Britney Levy, who says she joined the company in
                    April 2022 but received her first and only assignment
                    shortly before being laid off in November. Since then,
                    companies across the tech industry, including Amazon, Meta,
                    Microsoft, Twitter, PayPal, Yahoo, Zoom, IBM, Spotify, and
                    others, have announced massive layoffs, affecting tens of
                    thousands of employees.

                    Talking to the WSJ, experts said they believe companies
                    overhired during the pandemic-era boom not because they
                    needed more workers, but to hoard talent from rival
                    companies. According to Vijay Govindarajan, professor at
                    Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, the hiring spree was
                    initially fueled by a shortage of tech talent but eventually
                    became a competition, which led to companies "hiring ahead
                    of demand." He also pointed out that that the situation was
                    very similar to what happened in the finance industry in the
                    early 2000s, when companies overhired during periods of high
                    growth, leaving many workers with not enough work.

                    astronomy is trying to detect radio waves from charged
                    particles trapped by magnetic fields—magnetospheres—of
                    planets orbiting other stars. This would help to assess how
                    capable these exoplanets are of hosting life. Radio waves
                    from exoplanet magnetospheres would probably have
                    wavelengths greater than 100m, so they would require a
                    radio-quiet environment in space. Again, the far side of the

                    observe the universe at infrared wavelengths are very
                    sensitive to heat and therefore have to operate at low
                    temperatures. JWST, for example, needs a huge sunshield to
                    protect it from the sun's rays. On the Moon, a natural
                    crater rim could provide this shielding for free.

                    and Portugal. "In Canada, which we believe is a reliable
                    predictor for the US, our paid membership base is now larger
                    than prior to the launch of paid sharing and revenue growth

                    This rollout comes after paid sharing tests conducted in
                    Latin America in 2022 were rendered successful. Netflix
                    explains it saw initial cancel reactions in each of the
                    three countries it tested the paid sharing program when the
                    news were announced. But then it saw increased acquisition
                    and revenue as the "borrowers" activated their own paid
                    accounts and existing members began adding extra shared
                    accounts.

                    The European Union finally agreed on a new plan to boost its
                    microchip industry. The multi-billion investment is focused
                    on strengthening Europe's technological leadership, the EU
                    said, but it could very well be an attempt to put the Old
                    Continent on par with what market leaders are already doing
                    right now.

                    After spending some months negotiating between the European
                    Council and the European Parliament, the European Union has
                    now officially approved a plentiful subsidy plan for its
                    semiconductor industry. The

                    will put €43 billion (roughly $47 billion) to bolster
                    Europe's "competitiveness and resilience" in the microchip
                    business, promoting an effective digital and green

                    Right now, Europe has a 10% market share of global chip
                    manufacturing; with the EU Chips Act, Brussels plans to
                    double the EU's production capacity to 20% of the global
                    market by 2030.

                    >
                    is also focused on strengthening Europe's research and
                    technology capabilities over chip advancements, building
                    innovation capacity in design manufacturing and packaging,
                    developing an in-depth understanding of the global
                    semiconductor supply chain, and addressing the skills
                    shortage by attracting new talents and growing its own
                    skilled workforce.

                    Microchips already are "strategic assets for key industrial
                    value chains," the EU said, while the digital transformation
                    opened new markets for the chip industry such as highly
                    automated cars, cloud, IOT, connectivity, space, defense and
                    supercomputers. The recent global semiconductor shortages
                    also showed how the global supply chain has an "extreme"
                    dependency on very few actors in a complex geopolitical
                    context.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As a matter of fact, the final EU Chips Act contains
                    some additional provisions which were not included in the
                    initial draft. Besides funding the manufacturing of
                    cutting-edge semiconductor technology, the plan will also
                    cover the entire value chain with older chips and research
                    &amp; design facilities. The EU Chips Act is coming after
                    the world's powerhouses in the chip industry (USA, Taiwan,
                    South Korea, Japan) have already approved or are in the
                    process of approving their own subsidy initiatives.
                    Therefore, Brussels' money to boost EU semiconductor output
                    won't guarantee success.

                Long story short this adds an 2D barcode to product labels
                alongside the existing 1D barcode. The 2D barcode gives extra
                info to the retailer (assuming the manufacturer adds it to the
                barcode) like batch/lot #, expiry date etc and can also provide
                a URL for the product to the consumer where they can find out
                more info about the product. There's even a complete fake brand
                set up to show off the concept -
                <a href="https://dalgiardino.com/">https://dalgiardino.com/</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                Since most POS apps are likely going to be confused by 2
                barcodes on 1 product and potentially double-charge you for your
                favourite box of cornflakes the scanner vendors are implementing
                a feature where they'll only send 1 barcode to the POS system;
                for legacy scanners that'll be the 1D barcode (like now), for
                new scanners that can read 2D barcodes it can either be specific
                GS1 tags or the entire barcode depending on what the POS
                application wants.

                geographies, 2027 is just when it's intended to be deployed

                    The relevance of a quiet aircraft to the DOD is likely
                    obvious. Whisper has validated that it can fly a 55-pound
                    drone with its electric-ducted fan at an altitude of 200
                    feet that is completely undetectable, at least by noise,
                    from the ground. To put that in context, Moore said Boeing's
                    popular military drone, the Insitu ScanEagle, would need to
                    fly at least 3,000 feet above to not be heard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's sort of a breakthrough in terms of what surveillance
                    drones are capable of doing in terms of missions, by being
                    able to get so close and not be detected," Moore said.
                    "Especially at night, where you won't be able to see it. It
                    can be flying and loitering right overhead and you would
                    have no idea that's there."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The company is quick to point out that the benefits
                    don't just lie in decreased noise, but also in the
                    efficiency gains – a metric that's all the more important as
                    more of the world's technologies switch to electric, and
                    must depend on the limited lifespan of batteries. The
                    company also says that many aircraft have speeds that are
                    limited by open rotors (or open propellors), as opposed to
                    ducted. Instead of operating at 150 miles per hour, an eVTOL
                    could potentially fly as fast as 300-400 miles per hour.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We are this future Pratt &amp; Whitney mashed up with
                    a Dyson," Moore said, referring to the giant aircraft engine
                    maker and the consumer tech company best known for its
                    vacuums and hair dryers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We're very anxious to take this technology to people's
                    everyday life."

                    Camp says the discovery was a far cry from the malware he
                    typically studies, and a lot less work for an attacker who
                    happened upon one of these unwiped routers. "I don't need a
                    zero day, I have your router," quips Camp.

                  <p>
                    [...] Meanwhile, one of the unwiped routers contained what
                    Camp describes as a "creepy" remote administration
                    interface.

                    "I was never sure if it was on purpose, but it was creepy,
                    very low-level access, and from one of the countries with
                    flags that we're [the US] not happy with right now," he
                    says. "It could be totally legit or that could be really
                    bad. It was a little edgy to me."

                  <p>
                    [...] So how do you wipe a router that you want to retire?
                    The good news is most routers are fairly easy to securely
                    decommission, and the big three Cisco, Fortinet, and Juniper
                    on their websites provide detailed guidelines for restoring
                    devices to their factory default settings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And if your organization already had disposed of
                    routers that weren't properly wiped, Eset recommends
                    rotating cryptographic keys in case an attacker were to get
                    their hands on your old router and attempt to gain trusted
                    access to your network. Zero trust can help here as well,
                    they say.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] If you buy a secondhand core router, and like the
                    researchers find that it still contains the previous owner's
                    information, Eset recommends disconnecting the router and
                    moving it to a secured area and contact your regional CISA
                    office. They also say it's best to document your purchase
                    process as a precaution for insurance or legal purposes.

                    A retired NASA spacecraft will reenter Earth's atmosphere on
                    Wednesday, with some parts of the vehicle expected to crash

                    While most of the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar
                    Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) spacecraft is expected to burn
                    up as it enters the atmosphere at high speed, some parts of
                    the 660-pound (300-kilogram) machine are likely to survive
                    the descent.
                  </p>

                    that the risk of harm coming to folks on terra firma is low
                    at "approximately 1 in 2,467." Still, for anyone wishing to
                    don a hard hat just in case, RHESSI is expected to reenter
                    the atmosphere at about 9:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday, April 19,
                    though the forecast comes with an uncertainty of plus/minus
                    16 hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] RHESSI entered service in 2002 and, until its
                    retirement in 2018, it observed solar flares and coronal
                    mass ejections from its low-Earth orbit. Its work enabled
                    scientists to learn more about the underlying physics of how
                    these powerful bursts of energy occur.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spacecraft's activities included imaging the high-energy
                    electrons that carry a large part of the energy released in
                    solar flares. Using its imaging spectrometer, RHESSI became
                    the first-ever mission to record gamma-ray images and
                    high-energy X-ray images of solar flares.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The mission also helped to improve measurements of the
                    sun's shape, and demonstrated that terrestrial gamma ray
                    flashes — described by NASA as "bursts of gamma rays emitted
                    from high in Earth's atmosphere" and which occur above some
                    thunderstorms — happen more frequently than first thought.

                  <p>
                    NASA said it retired RHESSI in 2018 after maintaining
                    communications with it became difficult. After retaining its
                    low-Earth orbit for the last five years, the spacecraft is
                    about to meet a fiery end.

                    "When we first flew, we thought we would be incredibly lucky
                    to eke out five flights," said Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity
                    team lead at JPL, in a blog post celebrating the 50th flight
                    . "We have exceeded our expected cumulative flight time
                    since our technology demonstration wrapped by 1,250 percent
                    and expected distance flown by 2,214 percent."

                  <p>
                    The Ingenuity team is now planning a 51st flight to bring
                    the 'copter close to the "Fall River Pass" region of Jezero
                    Crater. Future flights will head towards "Mount Julian,"
                    from where the craft will enjoy panoramic views of the
                    nearby Belva Crater, an 800-metre dent in Mars' surface.

                    Between 2019 and 2020, data that Cybersixgill collected
                    reflected a massive surge in use of encrypted messaging
                    platforms, with the total number of collected items
                    increasing by 730%. In the firm's 2020-2021 analysis, this
                    number increased by 338%, and then just 23% in 2022 to some
                    1.9 billion items collected from messaging platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When considering workflow activity, it's quicker and easier
                    to browse through channels on the messaging platforms rather
                    than needing to log in to various forums, and read through
                    posts, etc.," said Liggett.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Across the dark web onion sites, the total number of forum
                    posts and replies decreased by 13% between 2021 and 2022,
                    dropping from over 91.7 million to around 79.1 million. The
                    number of threat actors actively participating in top forums
                    also declined slightly, according to the report.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 10 largest cybercrime forums averaged 165,390 monthly
                    users in 2021, which dropped by 4% to 158,813 in 2022.
                    However, posts on those 10 sites grew by nearly 28%, meaning
                    the forums' participants became more active.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study said that, in the past, most threat actors
                    conducted their operations on the dark web alone, while in
                    recent years there's been migration to deep-web encrypted
                    messaging platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cybercriminals favor deep web platforms because of their
                    relative ease of use versus Tor, which requires more
                    technical skills. "Across easily-accessible platforms, chats
                    and channels, threat actors collaborate and communicate,
                    trading tools, stolen data and services in an illicit
                    network that operates in parallel to its dark web
                    equivalent," said the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "People tend to communicate in real-time across these
                    platforms," said Liggett. "Forums and marketplaces in the
                    dark web are notorious for not always having a high level of
                    uptime. They sometimes end up going offline after a period
                    of time, or as we've seen recently have been seized by law
                    enforcement and government agencies," he said, noting that
                    one such platform, RaidForums, was taken down in 2022, and
                    BreachedForums just a couple weeks ago.

                    The timing of MariaDB's flotation may have been unfortunate.
                    While it was already in train, the SPAC model was going out
                    of favor.

                    Speaking to <em>The Register</em>, MariaDB CMO Franz Aman
                    said the company was still hiring, but a number of job
                    losses had also been necessary. "It's absolutely no secret
                    that, like companies in tech, we need to be super prudent,
                    and we need to be fiscal responsive. We also had a look at
                    our headcount plan, and we had to make sure that we were
                    doing the right things. We had a reduction in workforce...
                    so have most other tech companies: everyone's concerned
                    about profitability, cash position."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Aman argued that a "going concern" notice in regulatory
                    filings was far from unusual.

                    Elon Musk's stated goal of putting humans on Mars relies
                    heavily on the development of a next-generation reusable

                    Rocket or BFR) is ready for its first orbital test flight.
                    It's not the "six months" goal Musk projected in 2019, but

                    (things are actually slightly more complicated than this -
                    your password is used to generate a key that is then used to
                    encrypt and decrypt the <em>actual</em> encryption key. This
                    is necessary in order to allow you to change your password
                    without having to re-encrypt the entire drive - instead you
                    simply re-encrypt the encryption key with the new
                    password-derived key. This also allows you to have multiple
                    passwords or unlock mechanisms per drive)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Good KDFs reduce this risk by being what's technically
                    referred to as "expensive". Rather than performing one
                    simple calculation to turn a password into a key, they
                    perform a <em>lot</em> of calculations. The number of
                    calculations performed is generally configurable, in order
                    to let you trade off between the amount of security (the
                    number of calculations you'll force an attacker to perform
                    when attempting to generate a key from a potential password)
                    and performance (the amount of time you're willing to wait
                    for your laptop to generate the key after you type in your
                    password so it can actually boot). But, obviously, this
                    tradeoff changes over time - defaults that made sense 10
                    years ago are not necessarily good defaults now. If you set
                    up your encrypted partition some time ago, the number of
                    calculations required may no longer be considered up to
                    scratch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And, well, some of these assumptions are kind of bad in the
                    first place! Just making things computationally expensive
                    doesn't help a lot if your adversary has the ability to test
                    a large number of passwords in parallel. GPUs are extremely
                    good at performing the sort of calculations that KDFs
                    generally use, so an attacker can "just" get a whole pile of
                    GPUs and throw them at the problem. KDFs that are
                    computationally expensive don't do a great deal to protect
                    against this. However, there's another axis of expense that
                    can be considered - memory. If the KDF algorithm requires a
                    significant amount of RAM, the degree to which it can be
                    performed in parallel on a GPU is massively reduced. A
                    Geforce 4090 may have 16,384 execution units, but if each
                    password attempt requires 1GB of RAM and the card only has
                    24GB on board, the attacker is restricted to running 24
                    attempts in parallel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, in these days of attackers with access to a pile of
                    GPUs, a purely computationally expensive KDF is just not a
                    good choice. And, unfortunately, the subject of this story
                    was almost certainly using one of those. Ubuntu 18.04 used
                    the LUKS1 header format, and the only KDF supported in this
                    format is
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a>.
                    This is not a memory expensive KDF, and so is vulnerable to
                    GPU-based attacks. But even so, systems using the LUKS2
                    header format used to default to
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2">argon2i</a>,
                    again not a memory expensive KDF. New versions default to
                    argon2id, which is. You want to be using argon2id.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What makes this worse is that distributions generally don't
                    update this in any way. If you installed your system and it
                    gave you pbkdf2 as your KDF, you're probably still using
                    pbkdf2 even if you've upgraded to a system that would use
                    argon2id on a fresh install. Thankfully, this can all be
                    fixed-up in place. But note that if anything goes wrong here
                    you could lose access to all your encrypted data, so before
                    doing anything make sure it's all backed up (and figure out
                    how to keep said backup secure so you don't just have your
                    data seized that way).

                    However, the language as it stands has prompted concerns
                    from the open source world. While the text does seem to
                    exempt non-commercial open source software from its scope,
                    trying to define what is meant by "non-commercial" is not a

                    the time being. Starboard, the owner of pro-conservative
                    news outlets like <em>American Wire News</em>, has
                    <a href="https://parler.com/">shut down</a> Parler on a
                    temporary but indefinite basis after completing its
                    acquisition of the social network from Parlement
                    Technologies. The buyer says it will conduct a "strategic
                    assessment" of the platform during the downtime, and hopes
                    to integrate Parler's audience into all its existing
                    channels.

                    Starboard isn't shy about its strategy. While it still sees
                    a market for communities that believe they've been censored
                    or marginalized, it considers a Parler revamp virtually
                    necessary. "No reasonable person believes that a Twitter
                    clone just for conservatives is a viable business any more,"
                    the company says.

                    in January, the Great Salt Lake will likely also disappear
                    within five years if residents continue their current rate
                    of "unsustainable" water consumption.

                  <p>
                    The good news is Utahans still have time to halt or even
                    reverse the Great Salt Lake's decline by using less water.
                    Cutting agricultural and other outdoor water use by a third
                    to half through a combination of voluntary conservation
                    measures and policy changes would allow the lake to refill
                    enough to support the region's economy, ecology and quality
                    of life, the report says. If Utahans succeed, the Great Salt
                    Lake can be a model for how to save other saline lakes
                    around the world.

                    only goal is to attack an emerging technology).

                    on minimizing the potential damage by reducing the height of
                    the geysers, the volume of expelled water, or the resulting

                    NASA is clearly unable to install new hardware equipment on
                    Curiosity, but the latest software update makes image
                    processing faster so that the rover needs to stop "for just
                    a moment or two" instead of the full minute needed before.
                    This way, Curiosity will consume less energy and extend its
                    mission even further.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second major improvement brought by the R13 update is
                    for the rover's aluminum wheels, which started to show signs
                    of wear within the mission's first year. The patches
                    installed before provided the rover with an algorithm to
                    improve traction, now R13 "goes further" in that direction
                    by introducing "two new mobility commands" that can reduce
                    the amount of steering Curiosity needs to do "while driving
                    in an arc toward a specific waypoint," NASA said. The
                    driving process will be simpler, thus wear should be further
                    reduced.

                    by Boris Eldagsen took first prize in the Creative category
                    at the World Photography Organization's Sony World
                    Photography Awards — despite not being taken by a camera.
                    Eldagsen subsequently refused the award, saying "AI is not
                    photography. I applied [...] to find out if the competitions
                    are prepared for AI images to enter. They are not."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eldagsen's image is part of a series called
                    <em>PSEUDOMNESIA: Fake Memories</em>, designed to evoke a
                    photographic style of the 1940s. However, they are in
                    reality "fake memories of a past, that never existed, that
                    no one photographed. These images were imagined by language
                    and re-edited more between 20 to 40 times through AI image
                    generators, combining 'inpainting', 'outpainting', and
                    'prompt whispering' techniques."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a blog, Eldagsen explained that he used his experience as
                    a photographer to create the prize-winning image, acting as
                    a director of the process with the AI generators as
                    "co-creators." Although the work is inspired by photography,
                    he said that the point of the submission is that it is
                    <em>not</em> photography. "Participating in open calls, I
                    want to speed up the process of the Award organizers to
                    become aware of this difference and create separate
                    competitions for AI-generated images," he said.

                  <p>
                    Eldagsen subsequently declined the prize. "Thank you for
                    selecting my image and making this a historic moment, as it
                    is the first AI-generated image to win in a prestigious

                When does the processing of a 'photograph' become unacceptable?
                Techniques such as burning and dodging, plus various types of
                film processing, can all change the image that is finally
                produced. Digital photographs can be even more easily modified.
                At what point does it become an entirely new genre. Does the
                method of production really matter? [JR]

                    In Switzerland, one in three employees suffers from
                    workplace stress. Those affected often don't realise that
                    their physical and mental resources are dwindling until it's
                    too late. This makes it all the more important to identify
                    work-related stress as early as possible where it arises: in
                    the workplace.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at ETH Zurich are now taking a crucial step in
                    this direction. Using new data and machine learning, they
                    have developed a model that can tell how stressed we are
                    just from the way we type and use our mouse.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And there's more: "How we type on our keyboard and move our
                    mouse seems to be a better predictor of how stressed we feel
                    in an office environment than our heart rate," explains
                    study author Mara Nägelin, a mathematician who conducts
                    research at the Chair of Technology Marketing and the
                    Mobiliar Lab for Analytics at ETH Zurich. Applied correctly,
                    these findings could be used in future to prevent increased
                    stress in the workplace early on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers are currently testing their model with
                    data from Swiss employees who have agreed to have their
                    mouse and keyboard behaviour as well as their heart data
                    recorded directly at their workplace using an app. The same
                    app also regularly asks the employees about their subjective
                    stress levels. Results should be available by the end of the
                    year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, workplace stress detection also raises some thorny
                    issues: "The only way people will accept and use our
                    technology is if we can guarantee that we will anonymise and
                    protect their data. We want to help workers to identify
                    stress early, not create a monitoring tool for companies,"
                    Kerr says. In another study involving employees and
                    ethicists, the researchers are investigating which features
                    an app needs to have to meet these requirements and ensure
                    responsible handling of sensitive data.

                    As the world wakes up to exactly what a Tesla's onboard
                    cameras can capture and beam back to their makers, a wider

                    Systems such as telematics black boxes that record a
                    vehicle's location and how it is driven are commonplace
                    today. Complaints about how that data is fed back to Big
                    Brother seem old-fashioned.
