                    singing those lyrics is raw and plaintive, dipping into blue
                    notes. A lone acoustic guitar chugs behind it, punctuating
                    the vocal phrases with tasteful runs. But there's no human
                    behind the voice, no hands on that guitar. There is, in
                    fact, no guitar. In the space of 15 seconds, this credible,
                    even moving, blues song was generated by the latest AI model
                    from a startup named Suno. All it took to summon it from the
                    void was a simple text prompt: "solo acoustic Mississippi
                    Delta blues about a sad AI." To be maximally precise, the
                    song is the work of two AI models in collaboration: Suno's
                    <a href="https://www.suno.ai/">model</a> creates all the
                    music itself, while calling on OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate
                    the lyrics and even a title: "Soul of the Machine."

                    [...] Over the past year alone, generative AI has made major
                    strides in producing credible text, images (via services
                    like Midjourney), and even video, particularly with OpenAI's
                    new Sora tool. But audio, and music in particular, has
                    lagged. Suno appears to be cracking the code to

                      >AI music</a

                    imagine a world of wildly democratized music making. The
                    most vocal of the co-founders, Mikey Shulman, a boyishly
                    charming, backpack-toting 37-year-old with a Harvard Ph.D.
                    in physics, envisions a billion people worldwide paying 10
                    bucks a month to create songs with Suno. The fact that music
                    listeners so vastly outnumber music-makers at the moment is
                    "so lopsided," he argues, seeing Suno as poised to fix that
                    perceived imbalance.

                    "The idea of neutrino detection is you can't spoof it, you
                    can't shield it, you can't fake it. Neutrinos travel at
                    almost the speed of light, so they provide
                    near-instantaneous detection, even at distance. They offer a
                    unique signature of nuclear activity," said Orebi Gann, who
                    is also a faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National
                    Laboratory (Berkeley Lab).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If you're either a long way away or you've got a very weak
                    signature, then you need a big detector. And for a big
                    detector, you need liquid."

                  <p>
                    Eos is a 10-meter-tall, 5-meter-wide cylinder filled with
                    water and an organic scintillator and surrounded by light
                    detectors three times more sensitive than those used in
                    physics experiments today. Eos's improved sensitivity and
                    higher resolution come from combining two of today's best
                    techniques for detecting neutrinos: scintillation and
                    Cherenkov emission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The improvements could be a game-changer for future neutrino
                    physics projects, such as the Deep Underground Neutrino
                    Experiment (DUNE) now being constructed in an abandoned gold
                    mine in Lead, South Dakota, to detect neutrinos emitted by a
                    particle accelerator at Fermi National Laboratory, 500 miles
                    away in Illinois. UC Berkeley and Berkeley Lab are members
                    of the DUNE collaboration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What we would ultimately like to build is a much bigger
                    detector called Theia," she said. "Theia is the Titan
                    goddess of light and Eos's mother in the pantheon of gods.
                    The ideal location for Theia is in that mine in South
                    Dakota, seeing those neutrinos from Fermilab."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It remains to be seen whether Theia—which would employ a
                    tank large enough to nearly swallow the Statue of
                    Liberty—will replace one of DUNE's four planned liquid argon
                    "far" detectors.

                    Meta's official policy is to hand over Facebook data to U.S.
                    law enforcement in response to a court order, a subpoena, a
                    search warrant, or an emergency situation involving
                    "imminent harm to a child or risk of death or serious
                    physical injury to any person." The company received 73,956
                    requests from U.S. law enforcement and handed over data
                    87.84 percent of the time in the first half of 2023,
                    according to the

                    The NetBSD project is pleased to announce the eighteenth
                    major release of the NetBSD operating system

                  <p>
                    The netbsd-10 release branch is more than a year old now, so
                    it is high time the 10.0 release makes it to the front
                    stage. This matches the long time it took for the
                    development branch to get ready for branching, a lot of
                    development went into this new release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This also caused the release announcement to be one of the
                    longest we ever did.

                    AT&amp;T said it has begun notifying millions of customers
                    about the theft of personal data recently discovered online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The telecommunications giant said Saturday that a dataset
                    found on the "dark web" contains information such as Social
                    Security numbers for about 7.6 million current AT&amp;T
                    account holders and 65.4 million former account holders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company said it has already reset the passcodes of
                    current users and will be communicating with account holders
                    whose sensitive personal information was compromised.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is not known if the data "originated from AT&amp;T or one
                    of its vendors," the company said in a statement. The
                    compromised data is from 2019 or earlier and does not appear
                    to include financial information or call history, it said.
                    In addition to passcodes and Social Security numbers, it may
                    include email and mailing addresses, phone numbers and birth
                    dates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the data surfaced on a hacking forum nearly two weeks
                    ago, it closely resembles a similar data breach that
                    surfaced in 2021 but which AT&amp;T never acknowledged, said
                    cybersecurity researcher Troy Hunt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If they assess this and they made the wrong call on it, and
                    we've had a course of years pass without them being able to
                    notify impacted customers," then it's likely the company
                    will soon face class action lawsuits, said Hunt, founder of
                    an Australia-based website for warning people when their
                    personal information has been exposed.

                    black-capped chickadee has no trouble recalling where its
                    treats are stashed. Now researchers have discovered why: the
                    diminutive birds create a barcode-like memory each time they
                    stash food.

                  <p>
                    Black-capped chickadees are known for tucking food away
                    during the warmer months – with some

                    up to 500,000 food items a year. But more remarkable still
                    is their reliability in finding the morsels again.

                  <p>
                    Now researchers say they have unpicked the mechanism behind
                    the feat.
                    <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.02.032"
                      >Writing in the journal <em>Cell</em></a
                    >
                    scientists in the US report how they gave chickadees
                    sporadic access to sunflower seeds within an arena featuring
                    more than 120 locations where food could be stashed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The behaviour of the birds and the activity at each cache
                    site – be it the storage of food, retrieval of food or
                    checks on a stash – were recorded on video.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team used an implanted probe in the brain of each bird
                    to record the activity of neurons in its hippocampus – a
                    brain structure crucial for memory formation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results show that each time a bird stashed seeds, even
                    if it was in the same location, a different combination of
                    neurons fired in its hippocampus, resulting in a
                    barcode-like pattern of activity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The same "barcode" was observed when the morsel was
                    retrieved as for when it was cached.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The barcodes were distinct from place cells – neurons in the
                    hippocampus known to be involved in the formation of
                    memories involving specific locations. "The two overlapped
                    randomly so that neurons could be neither, either, or both,"
                    said Dr Selmaan Chettih of Columbia University's Zuckerman
                    Institute, first author of the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "These results suggest that the barcode represents a
                    specific episodic experience, unique in place and time in
                    the chickadee's life," the researchers report.

                    Radio communications play a key role in modern electronics,
                    but to a hobbyist, the underlying theory is hard to parse.
                    We get the general idea, of course: we know about
                    frequencies and can probably explain the difference between
                    amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. Yet, most of
                    us find it difficult to articulate what makes a good
                    antenna, or how a receiver can tune in to a specific
                    frequency and ignore everything else.

                    An international team of astronomers has discovered 49 new

                    Dr. Marcin Glowacki, from the Curtin University node of the
                    International Center for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) in
                    Western Australia, led the research, which aimed to study
                    the star-forming gas in a single radio galaxy. Although the
                    team didn't find any star-forming gas in the galaxy they
                    were studying, Dr. Glowacki instead discovered other
                    galaxies while inspecting the data.

                  <p>
                    Dr. Glowacki said, "These three are particularly
                    interesting, as by studying the galaxies at other
                    wavelengths of light, we discovered the central galaxy is
                    forming many stars. It is likely stealing the gas from its
                    companion galaxies to fuel its star formation, which may
                    lead the other two to become inactive."

                Oregon is now the fourth state in the country to enact a "right
                to repair" law to make it easier for consumers and independent
                shops to fix electronic gear. With Gov. Tina Kotek's signing of
                Senate Bill 1596 on Thursday, manufacturers will be required to
                offer any necessary documentation, parts, tools or any device
                needed to repair electronic equipment at a "fair cost" and on
                "reasonable" terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bill takes effect in January. It was championed by state
                Sen. Janeen Sollman, D-Hillsboro, who first started pushing for
                the legislation in 2021. The minority of lawmakers who opposed
                the bill were Republican. The bill had wide support from small
                businesses and consumer advocates, including OSPIRG, a statewide
                public interest group. Only one major manufacturer opposed the
                bill – Apple. An Apple representative who testified against the
                bill said it would undermine the company's security efforts, a
                claim lawmakers questioned.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] Besides Oregon, Minnesota, New York and California have
                right to repair laws on technology. Massachusetts has approved a
                right to repair law on vehicles and Colorado has adopted one for
                wheelchairs and another for farmers.

                    Michael Moussalli, the owner of Se7enLeaf, said that the
                    cannabis raid has nearly destroyed his business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    American police have been seizing cannabis for decades, but
                    the tables were turned last week, when law enforcement in a
                    California city was forced to return hundreds of pounds of
                    cannabis to a pot distributor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Costa Mesa police officers returned the massive shipment of
                    cannabis last week to Se7enLeaf, a cannabis distributor in
                    the city, according to the Los Angeles Times. The
                    authorities had accused the company of illegally operating
                    and seized the cannabis in September of last year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Michael Moussalli, the owner of Se7enLeaf, told SFGATE that
                    he was happy to get his cannabis back after his attorneys
                    explained he was operating legally, but he still blamed the
                    city for taking it in the first place and delaying its
                    return.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The sad thing is once all this info was shared, there was
                    no apologies. There was only more aggression," Moussalli
                    said, referencing the city's attempt to further delay the
                    return of the products. "The police were not happy that no
                    charges were filed. The police were not happy that the
                    product was being returned."

                        RF, and there are a number of radio engineers,
                        landscaping professionals, and other personnel who have
                        written RF safety rules with their blood (or, in most
                        cases, a permanent and painful RF burn that goes through
                        the inside of their body). Don't touch radio towers—AM

                    I predicted the hot dog would either explode, or do pretty
                    much nothing. My Dad imagined there would be some arcing.

                    Well, he was right—the hot dog wound up being a
                    <em>very effective loudspeaker</em>, transmitting the
                    audible sound with pretty high fidelity, at a volume around
                    that of a yelling human, maybe 80-100 dBa. (Next time we
                    attempt such an experiment, we may bring a dB meter and

                    easily be built by inserting wires into the spring terminals
                    connected to each component. An included manual guided you
                    through each of the projects, introducing new concepts and
                    providing structure, while still offering some latitude of
                    freedom to tinker — <em>but</em>, crucially, not the

                    Competing teams receive challenges based on real-world
                    software used in critical infrastructure systems. Bringing
                    on APRA-H as a partner will help ensure the competition
                    addresses critical flaws in healthcare. Plus, the research
                    agency has committed an additional $20 million in rewards
                    for the contest.

                    [...] While Carney can't give away too much about what the
                    contests will involve, one that's already been announced is
                    the Linux kernel challenge project [<a
                      href="https://aicyberchallenge.com/storage/2023/12/Request-for-Comments_Scoring-and-Exemplar-Preview_v1.0.pdf"
                      >PDF</a
                    >]. "We know that the Linux operating system powers a lot of
                    the devices and systems in many – if not all – of our
                    critical infrastructure sectors," he said. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This example challenge reintroduces a real-life
                    vulnerability, CVE-2021-43267, in the Linux kernel's
                    Transparent Inter Process Communication (TIPC) subsystem,
                    which allows communication across clusters on a network. The
                    challenge vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow
                    flaw.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "And successes that we have against that challenge are
                    implicitly very representative of the software that we would
                    need to secure in these sectors at large," Carney said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "And then specific to healthcare, if we start looking at
                    medical devices, 60 percent of all medical devices run some
                    flavor of Linux operating system," he added. "So once again,
                    as competitors find and fix vulnerabilities in that example
                    challenge, that translates into real-world safety, and
                    better defended, safer systems."

                    University researchers have created a new archive of ancient
                    human brains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The record of ancient brains highlights the different
                    environments they can be saved in, ranging from the frozen
                    Arctic to deserts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The collection of shrunken, discoloured samples was found
                    preserved in all manner of people including Egyptian and
                    Korean royalty as well as explorers and victims of war.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It gives researchers the chance to analyse the early
                    evolution of humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of the brains were up to 12,000 years old and found in
                    records dating back to the mid-17th century.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ancient human brains were found across a range of
                    different sites, including the shores of a lakebed in Stone
                    Age Sweden and the depths of an Iranian salt mine around 500
                    BC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Experts say preservation of soft tissue such as brains is
                    relatively rare in the geological record.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The findings, published in the Proceedings of the
                    Royal Society B, bring together the records of more than
                    4,000 preserved human brains from some two hundred sources,
                    across six continents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The analyses revealed patterns in the environmental
                    conditions associated with different modes of preservation
                    through time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More than 1,300 of the human brains were the only soft
                    tissues preserved, prompting questions as to why the brain
                    may persist when other organs perish.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These brains also represent the oldest in the archive with
                    several dating to the last Ice Age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Alexandra Morton-Hayward, lead author of the study, said:
                    "In the forensic field, it's well known that the brain is
                    one of the first organs to decompose after death yet this
                    huge archive clearly demonstrates that there are certain
                    circumstances in which it survives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Whether those circumstances are environmental, or related
                    to the brain's unique biochemistry, is the focus of our
                    ongoing and future work.

                    According to YouTube channel Bellular Warcraft, World of
                    Warcraft currently has around 7.25 million subscribers.
                    While the game appears to have recovered from the disaster

                    Subscriptions had been declining steadily since Cataclysm in
                    late 2010, when Draenor managed to boost them up to 10
                    million. Unfortunately, the spike was short-lived, and
                    Blizzard soon confirmed that WoW had plummeted to 5.5
                    million subscribers – the last hard number the company ever
                    released.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, sources recently provided Bellular Warcraft with
                    slides from the company's GDC 2024 postmortem, which
                    included a graph showing WoW subscription growth since 2016.
                    The only exact numbers on the chart are the years displayed
                    on the X-axis, but comments from Blizzard over the years
                    gave Bellular Warcraft just enough context to estimate the
                    real figures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An earnings report from the first quarter of 2017 mentioned
                    that the 2016 expansion, Legion, slightly surpassed its
                    immediate predecessor, Draenor. From there, Bellular
                    Warcraft estimated that the game had around 5.8 million
                    subscribers at that time. They arrived at the current number
                    of 7.25 million by counting the chart's pixels upward from
                    early 2017.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] After War for Azeroth sank subscriptions to
                    approximately 4.07 million, Classic bounced them back to
                    8.27 million. Then, the ensuing pandemic likely helped
                    sustain subscriber counts at a higher average compared to
                    the earlier trend of peaks and troughs. However, the
                    critically panned Shadowlands, which Blizzard's panel
                    admitted was badly executed, led to a collapse to 4.5
                    million in 2022. Subscriptions then recovered somewhat
                    leading to Dragonflight later that year, which missed
                    Blizzard's projections.

                    In extremely simplified terms, that means the camera uses a
                    computational imaging modality to capture spatial
                    information by letting light enter its sensor at slightly
                    different times. Not having to process the spatial data at
                    the moment is part of what frees the camera to capture those
                    extremely quick "chirped" laser pulses at up to 156.3
                    trillion times per second. The images' raw data can then be
                    processed by a computer algorithm that decodes the
                    time-staggered inputs, transforming each of the trillions of
                    frames into a complete picture.

                  <p>
                    Remarkably, it did so "using off-the-shelf and passive
                    optical components," as the paper describes. The team
                    describes SCARF as low-cost with low power consumption and
                    high measurement quality compared to existing techniques.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although SCARF is focused more on research than consumers,
                    the team is already working with two companies, Axis
                    Photonique and Few-Cycle, to develop commercial versions,
                    presumably for peers at other higher learning or scientific
                    institutions.

                  <p>
                    Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Monday signed a bill that
                    bans children aged under 14 from social media platforms and
                    requires 14- and 15-year-olds to get parental consent, a
                    measure supporters say will protect them from online risks
                    to their mental health.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The measure requires social media platforms to terminate the
                    accounts of people under 14 and those of people under 16 who
                    do not have parental consent. It requires them to use a
                    third-party verification system to screen out those who are
                    underage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The amended version allows for parents to provide consent
                    for older children to engage on social media platforms. It
                    will become law on Jan. 1, 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Social media harms children in a variety of ways,"
                    DeSantis said in a statement. He said the legislation "gives
                    parents a greater ability to protect their children."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Critics have said the bill violates the U.S.
                    Constitution's First Amendment protections for free speech
                    and that parents, not the government, should make decisions
                    about the online presence of their children of all ages.

                    With Euclid's vision cleared at the very first stage of the
                    procedure, scientists and engineers could tell where
                    precisely the ice had formed, and where it is likely to form
                    again. "Euclid's 'eye' has been cleared, allowing it to
                    clearly see faint light from distant galaxies, and more of
                    them than would otherwise be possible without this
                    operation," explains Reiko Nakajima, VIS instrument
                    scientist.

                    "We expect ice to cloud the VIS instrument's vision again in
                    the future. But it will be simple to repeat this selective
                    decontamination procedure every six to 12 months and with
                    very little cost to science observations or the rest of the
                    mission help future satellites likely to face the same,

                    In an interview on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor
                    ahead of Reddit's market debut on Thursday, chief executive
                    Steve Huffman acknowledged that the mischievous retail
                    investors that congregate on the social media platform might
                    deliberately drive down its share price.
                  </p>
                  <p>"It's a free market!" he said.</p>
                  <p>
                    For Reddit, as for Huffman, the bet on a public offering for
                    a site he described as a "fun and special, but sometimes
                    crazy place" has appeared to pay off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The chief executive sold 500,000 of his shares in the
                    IPO, cashing out a plump $17 million, and is due to receive
                    additional equity awards as a result of listing the company
                    above a $5 billion valuation. He also received an estimated
                    $193 million pay package last year, mostly made up of equity
                    awards, according to filings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Reddit, more so than many social media platforms, has
                    been a very community-based, non-commercial space and people
                    know and love it for [this]," said Samuel Woolley, a
                    propaganda expert and assistant professor at the University
                    of Texas at Austin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I think the big question that should be on everyone's mind
                    for Reddit is to what extent the IPO will change the very
                    nature and fabric of the platform."

                    If you enter "how to see the eclipse" into your favorite
                    search engine, you're bound to see thousands—millions?—of
                    helpful guides. Some of these are extremely detailed and
                    thorough, almost as if the author were getting paid by the
                    word or augmented by AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In reality, seeing a solar eclipse is just about the easiest
                    thing one can do in one's life. Like, it's difficult to
                    think of anything else that has the greatest reward-lowest
                    effort ratio in life. You just need to know a couple of
                    things. For the sake of simplicity, here is Ars' four-step
                    guide to having a four-star eclipse-viewing experience.
                    Steps are listed in order of ascending importance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In reality, a total solar eclipse is probably going to
                    be the most spectacular celestial event most of us see in
                    our lifetimes. Certainly, there could be more spectacular
                    ones. A supernova within 100 light-years of Earth would be
                    amazing. Witnessing a large asteroid streaking through
                    Earth's atmosphere before impact would be incredible.
                  </p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, those would also be lethal.</p>

                    Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are a promising alternative
                    to lithium–ion batteries (LiBs), the most common
                    rechargeable battery technology. As sulfur is abundant on
                    Earth, these batteries could be cheaper and more
                    environmentally friendly than LiBs, while also potentially
                    exhibiting higher energy densities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite these advantages, the deployment of Li–S batteries
                    has so far been limited, as many of these batteries also
                    have a low cycle life and a high self-discharge rate. In
                    addition, the predicted high energy density of Li–S
                    batteries often becomes far lower when in real applications,
                    due to the high rates at which they charge and discharge.

                  <p>
                    A chemical reaction that plays a central role in ensuring
                    the high capacity of Li–S batteries is the so-called sulfur
                    reduction reaction (SRR). This reaction has been widely
                    studied, yet its kinetic tendencies at high current rates
                    remain poorly understood.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at the University of Adelaide, Tianjin
                    University and Australian Synchrotron recently carried out a
                    study aimed at delineating the kinetic trend of SRR, to
                    inform the future development of high-power Li–S batteries.

                    >, published in <i>Nature Nanotechnology</i>, also
                    introduces a nanocomposite carbon electrocatalyst that was
                    found to boost the performance of Li–S batteries, attaining
                    a discharge capacity retention of approximately 75%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Building on their observations, the researchers
                    already introduced one electrocatalyst that was found to
                    enhance the capacity retention and cyclic stability of an
                    Li–S battery. In the future, their work could inspire the
                    design of other promising catalysts, potentially
                    contributing to the development of new high-power Li–S
                    battery technologies.

                    app on Windows 11. The new application doesn't seem to have
                    any functionality, and further investigation revealed that
                    it has 0 bytes of data, suggesting that it's actually a
                    placeholder shell for the most part. Thankfully, users can
                    uninstall the app by simply using the built-in 'Uninstall'

                    can access up to ten Copilot requests before needing to
                    sign-in with a Microsoft ID. The feature is still in preview

                    To compare the models, they split the data into a training
                    set and a test set. Once a model was trained on the data
                    within the training set, they evaluated its ability to
                    predict the test set.

                  <p>
                    The researchers found that all the models were better than
                    the trained panel of human experts at predicting the rating
                    a beer had received from RateBeer.

                  <p>
                    Through these models, the researchers were able to pinpoint
                    specific compounds that contribute to consumer appreciation
                    of a beer: people were more likely to rate a beer highly if
                    it contained these specific compounds. For example, the
                    models predicted that adding lactic acid, which is present
                    in tart-tasting sour beers, could improve other kinds of
                    beers by making them taste fresher.

                  <p>
                    "We had the models analyze these beers and then asked them
                    'How can we make these beers better?'" says Kevin
                    Verstrepen, a professor at KU Leuven and director of the
                    VIB-KU Leuven Center for Microbiology, who worked on the
                    project. "Then we went in and actually made those changes to
                    the beers by adding flavor compounds. And lo and behold—once
                    we did blind tastings, the beers became better, and more
                    generally appreciated."

                    A team of aroma chemists at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität
                    Erlangen-Nürnberg, working with psychologist colleagues from
                    the Technical University of Dresden, has uncovered the
                    reasons for the dissimilar smells between babies and
                    teenagers. The
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-024-01131-4"

                    is published in the journal
                    <em>Communications Chemistry</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prior research and anecdotal evidence have shown that babies
                    have a pleasant smell, often described as sweet. Teenagers,
                    on the other hand, especially males, have often been
                    described as smelling less pleasant. In this new effort, the
                    research team sought to find out what causes the difference.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers found that most of the chemicals
                    responsible for body odor were similar between the two
                    groups of volunteers. But there were a few that made the
                    difference. Teenage sweat, for example, had high levels of
                    many kinds of carboxylic acids, which the assessors
                    described as "earthy, musty or cheesy."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They also found two steroids in the teen sweat not present
                    in the baby sweat, one of which resulted in "musk or
                    urine-like" emanations—the other, the assessors suggested,
                    smelled more like "musk and sandalwood." Without such
                    chemicals, the sweat of babies smelled much sweeter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers suggest that study of the chemical compounds
                    in teen sweat could prove fruitful for makers of
                    odor-control products. They also suggest that more work
                    could <i>[be]</i> done to better understand the impact of
                    such odors on parents.

              <p>
                I would like to thank you all for your patience during the
                recent outages. Something is causing a problem with the database
                itself. It appears to be running out of room and thus having
                problems when creating backups. This is not a new phenomenon -
                NCommander observed that the database was corrupted in Nov/Dec
                2022, and he fixed the corruptions that were present at that
                time. I know that others have done similar 'repairs' over the
                years. Those of you who have been with us a while will know that
                we have had various site outages since the site's inception in
                2014. We try to get the site up as quickly as possible but we
                currently have a single active sys-admin who has to find the
                time to fix the site in between running his own business and
                having a decent work/life balance. The cause of these
                corruptions has not been identified despite speculation by some
                individuals.

                The administration associated with creating a business continues
                and we think that we are now at the final stage. The paperwork
                has to be signed by several people and this means sending mail
                around the USA in order to get real signatures from specific
                individuals. However, we think that this should only take a week
                or two.

              <p>
                For the last month or so we have been deleting Spam from the
                Polls and journals. Deleting content is not new. Spam, doxxing,
                abusive material, CEOS, inappropriate ASCII art etc has often
                been deleted in the last 10 years. In fact, most of our
                registered community have the ability to delete some material
                (their own journals for example), and this has happened from
                time to time in the past. We also delete outdated submissions on
                a daily basis. The site software provides a means of making such
                deletions and it can cope with them. The software that is being
                used is not new - it has been in Rehash since the site became
                active. We have received some positive feedback regarding this
                measure - the Polls and journals are looking much tidier as a
                result. Unfortunately, we are going to temporarily suspend this
                measure to simplify the investigations into the database
                corruption problems. So, as unsightly as they are, we will be
                returning to the use of Spam moderations on a hopefully
                temporary basis. We have, of course, also received some negative
                feedback but it only seems to have come from a couple of
                Anonymous Cowards, one of whom is our most prolific spammer.

              <p><b>Participation</b></p>
              <p>
                Finally, I would like to thank the staff for their continued
                efforts in keeping the site online and active. The participating
                user count continues to climb, as does the number of pages
                served each day. Many usernames that have existed for a long
                time but appear to have been inactive for a while are
                reappearing and participating in the discussions. I hope that we
                will soon be able to restructure our site in an affordable yet
                more robust structure in the very near future.

                    many music fans—and hated by so many others? Pitchfork
                    transformed indie rock, but did pop transform Pitchfork? And
                    does the Condé news really mean that Pitchfork is dead?

                    Over the past two months, Slate spoke to more than 30
                    Pitchfork writers, editors, and executives, past and
                    present—as well as critics, industry luminaries, and some of
                    the musicians whose careers Pitchfork made and destroyed—to
                    tell the story behind the raves, the pans, the festivals,
                    the fights, the indie spirit, the corporate takeover, and,
                    of course, the scores. This is the complete oral history of
                    <a href="https://pitchfork.com/">Pitchfork</a>.

                    [...] The gutting of Pitchfork is not just a loss for
                    writers and editors, but all music fans. Spotify's algorithm
                    can introduce you to new music but it can't contextualise it
                    or tell its stories. Replacing media "gatekeepers" with AI
                    ones has not enriched the culture. There are new formats for
                    music journalism – the YouTuber Anthony Fantano is perhaps
                    the world's most influential music critic, while Cole
                    Cuchna's podcast Dissect is a masterclass in analysis – but
                    like any art form, popular music deserves a thriving
                    critical culture in the written word. While some music
                    websites survive, notably the defiantly left-field digital
                    magazine, the Quietus, it is striking that the alleged
                    dinosaurs of print, led in the UK by Mojo and Uncut, have
                    outlasted most of their supposed successors.

                    While it doesn't have the same relevance to public
                    consciousness as safety problems with commercial airliners,
                    a successful test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in
                    May would be welcome news for the beleaguered aerospace
                    company.

                    This will be the first time the Starliner capsule flies into
                    low-Earth orbit with humans aboard. NASA astronauts Butch
                    Wilmore and Suni Williams are in the final stages of
                    training for the so-called Crew Flight Test (CFT), a
                    milestone running seven years behind the schedule Boeing
                    said it could achieve when it won a $4.2 billion commercial
                    crew contract from NASA a decade ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If schedules hold, Wilmore and Williams will take off inside
                    Boeing's Starliner spacecraft aboard a United Launch
                    Alliance Atlas V rocket after midnight May 1, local time,
                    from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. They
                    will fly Starliner to the International Space Station for a
                    stay of at least eight days, then return the capsule to a
                    parachute-assisted, airbag-cushioned landing in the western
                    United States, likely at White Sands, New Mexico.

                  <p>
                    The first human spaceflight with Starliner will launch under
                    a lame-duck Boeing CEO. Dave Calhoun, who took the helm at
                    Boeing in 2020, announced Monday he will step down at the
                    end of the year. Boeing's chairman, Larry Kellner, will not
                    seek reelection at the company's next shareholder meeting.
                    Effective immediately, Boeing is also replacing the head of
                    its commercial airplanes unit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The last few years have not been good for Boeing. A spate of
                    safety shortcomings in the company's commercial airline
                    business has shattered the company's reputation. Two crashes
                    of Boeing's 737 Max 8 airplanes in 2018 and 2019 killed 346
                    people, and investigators blamed Boeing's design and
                    software for the accidents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In a report released by the Federal Aviation
                    Administration last month, a panel of experts found that
                    Boeing's safety culture was "inadequate and confusing." The
                    panel also noted a "lack of pilot input in aircraft design
                    and operation."

                    and rounds of layoffs amid the pandemic. But, it offers
                    clear data on just how important job flexibility and
                    security are to the health and well-being of workers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Overall, the study's findings indicate "the
                    substantive impact that flexible and secure jobs can have on
                    mental health in the short-term and long-term," the
                    researchers conclude.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They do note limitations of the study, the main one being
                    that the study identifies associations and can't determine
                    that job flexibility and security directly caused mental
                    health outcomes and the work absence findings. Still, they
                    suggest that workplace policies could improve the mental
                    health of employees.

                    Last week I fell into a bit of a rabbit hole: why do regular
                    expressions use $ and ^ as line anchors?1
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This talk brings up that they first appeared in Ken
                    Thompson's port of the QED text editor. In his manual he
                    writes: b) "^" is a regular expression which matches
                    character at the beginning of a line.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    c) "$" is a regular expression which matches character
                    before the character (usually at the end of a line)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    QED was the precursor to ed, which was instrumental in
                    popularizing regexes, so a lot of its design choices stuck.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Okay, but then why did Ken Thompson choose those characters?

                Dr Andy Farnell at
                <a href="https://cybershow.uk/">The Cyber Show</a> writes about
                motivations behind dropping use of generative AI for graphics
                and moving back to manual design and editing of images. The show
                had been using generative AI to produce images since its first
                episode, but now find that it is time to rethink that policy. As
                the guard rails for generative AI are set up and the boundaries
                restricted, it gets more racist, more gendered, and less able to
                output edgy ideas critical of its corporate owners and its
                potential as an equalizing force seems dead already. So, while
                the show could set up its own AI instance to generate the images
                they desire, there is the matter of association and the decision
                to stop using it has been made.

                    Doubts emerged late last year after Helen battled with many
                    of the generative platforms to get less racist and gendered
                    cultural assumptions. We even had some ideas for an episode
                    about baked bias, but other podcasters picked up on that and
                    did a fine job of investigating and explicating.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Though, maybe more is still to be said. With time I've
                    noticed the "guardrails" are staring to close in like a pack
                    of dogs. The tools seem ever less willing to output edgy
                    ideas critical of corporate gangsters. That feels like a
                    direct impingement on visual art culture. Much like

                    there seems to be an built-in aversion to humour, and for
                    that matter to hope, love or faith in the future of humaity.
                    The "five giant websites filled with screenshots of text
                    from the other four" are devoid of anything human.

                    Like the companies that make them, commercial AI tools seem
                    to have blind-spots around irony, juxtaposition and
                    irreverence. They have no chutzpah. Perhaps we are just
                    bumping into the limits of machine creativity in its current
                    iteration. Or maybe there's a "directing mind", biasing
                    output toward tepid, mediocre "acceptability". That's not
                    us!

                    Boeing Co CEO Dave Calhoun will step down by year-end, in a
                    broad management shakeup brought on by the plane maker's
                    sprawling safety crisis stemming from a January mid-air
                    panel blowout on a 737 Max plane.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The plane maker also said that Stan Deal, Boeing Commercial
                    Airplanes President and CEO, would retire, and Stephanie
                    Pope would lead that business. Steve Mollenkopf has been
                    appointed the new chair of the board.

                    The leadership change caps weeks of turmoil at Boeing, after
                    the mid-air incident involving an Alaska Airlines-operated
                    Max 9 jet carrying 171 passengers turned into a full-blown
                    safety and reputational crisis for the iconic plane maker.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company is facing heavy regulatory scrutiny and U.S.
                    authorities curbed production while it attempts to fix
                    safety and quality issues. The company is in talks to buy
                    its former subsidiary Spirit AeroSystems to try to get more
                    control over its supply chain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since Calhoun took the reins, the company has endured
                    ongoing delays to production. Still, in October, Calhoun was
                    upbeat over how fast Boeing could raise output of its Max
                    jets, saying Boeing would get back to 38 jets a month and
                    was "anxious to build from there as fast as we can."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But weeks after the mid-air cabin panel blowout in January,
                    Calhoun said it's time to "go slow to go fast."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company's crisis has frustrated airlines already
                    struggling with delivery delays from both Boeing and its
                    rival Airbus, and the plane maker has been burning more cash
                    than expected in this quarter than expected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For years, we prioritized the movement of the airplane
                    through the factory over getting it done right, and that's
                    got to change," West said last week.

                    Astronomers don't know when we'll see the nova, but they
                    know where. It'll be visible in the constellation Corona
                    Borealis, shining like a jewel in the Northern Crown. It's a
                    U-shaped constellation behind Hercules' back and under
                    Boötes the Herdman's elbow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While not as spectacularly dramatic as a supernova,
                    Gilbraith hopes Wyomingites will be curious enough to seek
                    out Corona Borealis and observe the impending nova. Once its
                    light gets here, it should be visible for several weeks, at
                    least.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The nova might not be the brightest or most exciting
                    sight in the night sky, but it's quite important for
                    science. Gilbraith said novae help astronomers measure
                    precise distances in space, revealing our distance from
                    other galaxies with much greater accuracy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But T Coroane Borealis is special. It's one of only five
                    recurring novae in the night sky, which means it has
                    repeatedly sent flashes of light, usually once every 80
                    years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "A nova is a standard candle that always occurs at a
                    characteristic mass," he said. "It's holding onto some mass
                    thrown it from its neighbor, and it will briefly reignite
                    that candle just a little."

                    Google will spend $1 billion to build a new data center in

                    Missouri governor Mike Parson. The new plant is expected to
                    provide significant benefits for Missouri's Northland
                    economy, while Picou highlighted how Kansas City and Google

                    Data centers are the backbone of Google's investment
                    strategy, Picou said, especially now that the industry is
                    reaching an important "inflection point" for tech innovation
                    thanks to AI algorithms. Governor Parson

                    Mayor Lucas said that one in every ten workers in Kansas
                    City is involved in the technology industry, and thanks to
                    Google, the city will keep growing its appeal for tech
                    companies. The firm is planning to fund the North Kansas

                  <p>
                    In December 2014, North Korea's cyber group Kimsuky
                    conducted an attack on the South Korean Korea Hydro and
                    Nuclear Power (KHNP), leaking personal information of 10,000
                    employees, reactor blueprints, manuals, electricity charts,
                    radiation methods and more. Despite the impact of the 2014
                    KHNP hack on South Korea, it has figured minimally in
                    English-language cybersecurity literature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In 2013, North Korea used the DARKSEOUL malware to
                    paralyze ROK broadcasting stations, banks and government
                    sites after its long-term espionage campaign, Operation
                    Troy. In December 2014, however, despite those precautionary
                    steps, KHNP was hacked. Kimsuky used a Twitter account named
                    "president of anti-nuclear reactor group" to post sensitive
                    documents and blueprints from KHNP and threatened to leak
                    more information unless specific reactors in Gori and
                    Wolseong were shut down by Christmas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As with most research regarding cyber operations and
                    the DPRK, the scarcity of publicly available information
                    posed a challenge. This was especially true for the period

                    receive the death penalty if convicted, before a UK court

                    In a High Court judgment on Tuesday, Dame Victoria Sharp and

                    If there is life in the solar system beyond Earth, it might
                    be found in the clouds of Venus. In contrast to the planet's
                    blisteringly inhospitable surface, Venus' cloud layer, which
                    extends from 30 to 40 miles above the surface, hosts milder
                    temperatures that could support some extreme forms of life.

                  <p>
                    If it's out there, scientists have assumed that any Venusian
                    cloud inhabitant would look very different from life forms
                    on Earth. That's because the clouds themselves are made from
                    highly toxic droplets of sulfuric acid—an intensely
                    corrosive chemical that is known to dissolve metals and
                    destroy most biological molecules on Earth.

                    reports that, in fact, some key building blocks of life can
                    persist in solutions of concentrated sulfuric acid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study's authors have found that 19 amino acids that are
                    essential to life on Earth are stable for up to four weeks
                    when placed in vials of sulfuric acid at concentrations
                    similar to those in Venus' clouds. In particular, they found
                    that the molecular "backbone" of all 19 amino acids remained
                    intact in sulfuric acid solutions ranging in concentration
                    from 81% to 98%.

                    "What is absolutely surprising is that concentrated sulfuric
                    acid is not a solvent that is universally hostile to organic
                    chemistry," says study co-author Janusz Petkowski, a
                    research affiliate in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric
                    and Planetary Sciences (EAPS).

                    [...] The search for life in Venus' clouds has gained
                    momentum in recent years, spurred in part by a controversial
                    detection of phosphine—a molecule that is considered to be
                    one signature of life—in the planet's atmosphere. While that
                    detection remains under debate, the news has reinvigorated
                    an old question: Could Earth's sister planet actually host
                    life?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In search of an answer, scientists are planning several
                    missions to Venus, including the first largely privately
                    funded mission to the planet, backed by California-based
                    launch company Rocket Lab. That mission, on which Seager is
                    the science principal investigator, aims to send a
                    spacecraft through the planet's clouds to analyze their
                    chemistry for signs of organic molecules.

                    Have you ever wondered what's inside your Macbook's charger?
                    There's a lot more circuitry crammed into the compact power
                    adapter than you'd expect, including a microprocessor. This
                    charger teardown looks at the numerous components in the
                    charger and explains how they work together to power your
                    laptop.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most consumer electronics, from your cell phone to your
                    television, use a switching power supply to convert AC power
                    from the wall to the low-voltage DC used by electronic
                    circuits. The switching power supply gets its name because
                    it switches power on and off thousands of times a second,
                    which turns out to be a very efficient way to do this
                    conversion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] One unexpected component is a tiny circuit board with
                    a microcontroller, which can be seen above. This 16-bit
                    processor constantly monitors the charger's voltage and
                    current. It enables the output when the charger is connected
                    to a Macbook, disables the output when the charger is
                    disconnected, and shuts the charger off if there is a
                    problem. This processor is a Texas Instruments MSP430
                    microcontroller, roughly as powerful as the processor inside
                    the original Macintosh.

                    Doctors in Boston have transplanted a pig kidney into a
                    62-year-old patient, the latest experiment in the quest to
                    use animal organs in humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Massachusetts General Hospital said Thursday that it's the
                    first time a genetically modified pig kidney has been
                    transplanted into a living person. Previously, pig kidneys
                    have been temporarily transplanted into brain-dead donors.
                    Also, two men received heart transplants from pigs, although
                    both died within months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The patient, Richard "Rick" Slayman of Weymouth,
                    Massachusetts, is recovering well from the surgery last
                    Saturday and is expected to be discharged soon, doctors said
                    Thursday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, the transplant surgeon, said the team
                    believes the pig kidney will work for at least two years. If
                    it fails, Slayman could go back on dialysis, said kidney
                    specialist Dr. Winfred Williams. He noted that unlike the
                    pig heart recipients who were very sick, Slayman is
                    "actually quite robust."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Dr. Parsia Vagefi, chief of surgical transplantation
                    at UT Southwestern Medical Center, called the announcement
                    "a big step forward." But echoing the Boston doctors, he
                    said studies involving more patients at different medical
                    centers would be needed for it to become more commonly
                    available.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The experiment marks the latest development in
                    xenotransplantation, the term for efforts to try to heal
                    human patients with cells, tissues, or organs from animals.
                    For decades, it didn't work — the human immune system
                    immediately destroyed foreign animal tissue. More recent
                    attempts have involved pigs that have been modified so their
                    organs are more humanlike — increasing hope that they might
                    one day help fill a shortage of donated organs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Pigs have long been used in human medicine, including
                    pig skin grafts and implantation of pig heart valves. But
                    transplanting entire organs is much more complex than using
                    highly processed tissue. The kidney implanted in Slayman was
                    provided by eGenesis of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The pig
                    was genetically edited to remove harmful pig genes and add
                    certain human genes to improve its compatibility with
                    humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Food and Drug Administration gave special
                    permission for Slayman's transplant under "compassionate
                    use" rules.

                    For over half a century, aperiodic tilings have fascinated

                    between aperiodic tilings and a seemingly unrelated branch
                    of computer science: the study of how future quantum
                    computers can encode information to shield it from errors.
                    In a paper posted to the preprint server arxiv.org in
                    November, the researchers showed how to transform Penrose
                    tilings into an entirely new type of quantum
                    error-correcting code. They also constructed similar codes
                    based on two other kinds of aperiodic tiling.

                  <p>
                    At the heart of the correspondence is a simple observation:
                    In both aperiodic tilings and quantum error-correcting
                    codes, learning about a small part of a large system reveals
                    nothing about the system as a whole.

                      href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R2493"

                    a clever way to store quantum information. His encoding had
                    two key properties. First, it could tolerate errors that
                    only affected individual qubits. Second, it came with a
                    procedure for correcting errors as they occurred, preventing
                    them from piling up and derailing a computation. Shor's
                    discovery was the first example of a quantum
                    error-correcting code, and its two key properties are the
                    defining features of all such codes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ...An infinite two-dimensional plane covered with Penrose
                    tiles, like a grid of qubits, can be described using the
                    mathematical framework of quantum physics: The quantum
                    states are specific tilings instead of 0s and 1s. An error
                    simply deletes a single patch of the tiling pattern, the way
                    certain errors in qubit arrays wipe out the state of every
                    qubit in a small cluster.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The next step was to identify tiling configurations that
                    wouldn't be affected by localized errors, like the virtual
                    qubit states in ordinary quantum error-correcting codes. The
                    solution, as in an ordinary code, was to use superpositions.
                    A carefully chosen superposition of Penrose tilings is akin
                    to a bathroom tile arrangement proposed by the world's most
                    indecisive interior decorator. Even if a piece of that
                    jumbled blueprint is missing, it won't betray any
                    information about the overall floor plan.

                I wonder... does the Penrose / Einstein principle of
                non-repetition preclude cylindrical, or even donut surface
                topology full tilings? If not, that could solve the infinite
                plane mapping into a physically realizable quantum computer
                problem. I do wonder, but not enough to give up all my other
                work and hobbies to pursue deeply theoretical mathematics being
                heavily studied by thousands of PhD mathematicians less than
                half my age...

                    But opponents argued mankind had been reshaping the planet
                    long before the 1950s, pointing to defining moments like the
                    advent of farming and the industrial revolution.

                    [...] "I feel this has been a missed opportunity to
                    recognise and endorse a simple reality, that our planet left
                    its natural functioning state in the mid-20th century," Dr
                    Head, a professor of earth sciences at Brock University in
                    Canada, told AFP.

                    There was no disagreement that 'the age of man' had resulted
                    in profound planetary changes, said Dr Erle Ellis, an
                    environmental scientist critical of the Anthropocene
                    proposal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But scientists weren't convinced this impact represented an
                    epoch, no less one that definitively began only seven
                    decades ago, said Dr Ellis, professor of geography and
                    environmental systems at the University of Maryland.

                  <p>
                    "The truth is, there was never a need for a firm boundary.
                    It just wasn't the critical thing," he told AFP earlier this
                    month after the proposal was first voted down.

                    Thursday (Mar. 21), legislation designed to further protect
                    the state's artists from artificial intelligence deep fakes.
                    The bill, more formally named the Ensuring Likeness Voice
                    and Image Security Act of 2024, replaces the state's old
                    right of publicity law, which only included explicit
                    protections for one's "name, photograph, or likeness,"
                    expanding protections to include voice- and AI-specific
                    concerns for the first time.

                    photographs and likeness are considered a property right
                    rather than a right of publicity. According to the newly
                    signed statute — dubbed the Ensuring Likeness, Voice, and
                    Image Security Act or "ELVIS Act" — vocal likeness will now
                    be added to that list.

                Ostensibly this right is already protected in many states, even
                against AI cloning and imitation, but now this law addresses the
                problem explicitly, at least in Tennessee.

                    The next time you're on a walk, consider stopping by that
                    restaurant you've never been to or the local store you keep
                    meaning to check out. They just might be the key to a
                    vibrant local economy, according to a new study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a surprise finding based on anonymized cell phone
                    mobility records, infrequent trips to places like
                    restaurants and sports facilities—not the everyday office
                    visit or school drop-off—accounted for the majority of
                    differences in economic outcomes between neighborhoods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lesson for urban planners and individuals, researchers
                    said, is to embrace the unusual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The activities with the strongest predictive power
                    included French and New American restaurants, golf courses,
                    hockey rinks, soccer games, and bagel shops. These kinds of
                    activities accounted for just 2% of trips but explained more
                    than 50% of the variation in economic outcomes between
                    neighborhoods. Wang and his collaborators didn't initially
                    expect these leisure activities to be so tied to local
                    economic fortunes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Those irregular and infrequent activities are
                    correlated with explorative behavior, the tendency of some
                    groups to seek out opportunities, connect with different
                    people, and create new businesses," said Esteban Moro,
                    Ph.D., a professor at Northeastern University, who co-led
                    the study. "Looking at those infrequent activities, we are
                    directly looking at current and potential economic
                    opportunities in the future."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] What was most surprising was that trips to the
                    office—where we earn our money—were not strongly associated
                    with income or property values. Rather, it's how we spend
                    our free time that drives the economic vibrancy of cities.
