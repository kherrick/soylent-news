                    The philosophy changed with the Spirit and Opportunity
                    rovers, whose teams started using more intentional names.
                    For instance, the Opportunity team nicknamed a crater
                    "Endurance" to honor the ship that carried explorer Ernest
                    Shackleton's ill-fated expedition to Antarctica. The names
                    for the spots where Curiosity and Perseverance landed honor
                    science-fiction writers Ray Bradbury and Octavia E. Butler,
                    respectively. The InSight team named a rock that had been
                    jostled by the lander's retrorockets during touchdown
                    "Rolling Stones Rock," after the band. And the Curiosity
                    team named a Martian hill after their colleague Rafael
                    Navarro-Gonz√°lez, who died from COVID-19 complications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Then, as now, team members suggested ideas for themes
                    based on sites where they have worked or to which they have
                    a personal connection, and they informally discussed which
                    would be the most interesting to include, keeping in mind
                    that various names would be memorialized in future
                    scientific papers. Once a theme is picked, hundreds of names
                    fitting into that theme are compiled. That many are needed
                    because the available names can dwindle quickly, given that
                    Curiosity may stay in a quadrant for several months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Curiosity's latest quadrant, the rover's team chose a
                    theme named after Roraima, the northernmost state of Brazil,
                    and for Mount Roraima, the highest peak in the Pacaraima
                    Mountains, located near the border of Venezuela, Brazil, and
                    Guyana. This marked the first South American quadrant theme.
                    The sulfate-enriched region Curiosity is currently
                    exploring, with its flat-topped hills and steep slopes,
                    reminded them of the "tabletop" mountains in the Pacaraima
                    range.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Perseverance, scientists chose to go with national park
                    themes. The rover is now exploring the Rocky Mountain
                    quadrant and recently drilled into rocks at a location
                    bearing the nickname of Rocky Mountain National Park's
                    "Powell Peak."

                    By pumping water out of the ground and moving it elsewhere,
                    humans have shifted such a large mass of water that the
                    Earth tilted nearly 80 centimeters (31.5 inches) east
                    between 1993 and 2010 alone, according to a new study
                    published in <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i>.

                    humans pumped 2,150 gigatons of groundwater, equivalent to
                    more than 6 millimeters (0.24 inches) of sea level rise,
                    from 1993 to 2010. But validating that estimate is
                    difficult.

                      >discovered in 2016</a
                    >, and until now, the specific contribution of groundwater
                    to these rotational changes was unexplored. In the new
                    study, researchers modeled the observed changes in the drift
                    of Earth's rotational pole and the movement of water‚Äîfirst,
                    with only ice sheets and glaciers considered, and then
                    adding in different scenarios of groundwater redistribution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The model only matched the observed polar drift once the
                    researchers included 2150 gigatons of groundwater
                    redistribution. Without it, the model was off by 78.5
                    centimeters (31 inches), or 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches) of
                    drift per year.

                    "I'm very glad to find the unexplained cause of the rotation
                    pole drift," [lead study author Ki-Weon] Seo said. "On the
                    other hand, as a resident of Earth and a father, I'm
                    concerned and surprised to see that pumping groundwater is
                    another source of sea-level rise."

                    Since October, dozens of RTX 4090 owners have reported
                    melting power adapter cables. Despite investigations from
                    Nvidia and third parties, a definitive cause has yet to be
                    determined. It was thought that pairing the GPU with an ATX
                    3.0 power supply was a safe solution... until now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A new report of a burnt GeForce RTX 4090 power cable has
                    emerged on Reddit, but this case is fundamentally different
                    from prior incidents. If it's connected to the same flaw, it
                    could cast doubt on earlier theories as to the problem's
                    source.

                    power cable connector and the corresponding connection port
                    on a 1000W BeQuet Dark Power 13 ATX 3.0 power supply. This
                    case is potentially significant because despite looking
                    similar to previous examples of scorched 4090 cables, it
                    lacks two common factors between the others.

                    since October resulted in damage to the connectors plugged
                    into the graphics card. Furthermore, they all affected
                    customers who used the 4090's bundled 16-pin connection
                    adapters to plug the GPU into an ATX 2.0 power supply's
                    12-pin socket.

                  <p>
                    Shiftyeyes67k bought an ATX 3.0 PSU with a 16-pin socket
                    specifically to avoid this problem. Prior incidents led
                    users to blame the adapter, and upgrading to an ATX 3.0
                    power supply is a small investment compared to the $1,600
                    4090, but this instance involved no adapter. Another owner
                    who reported the problem last month had used a high-end
                    third-party adapter, casting early doubt on Nvidia's
                    included attachments as the source of the issue.

                    objections, detailing ad tech antitrust charges and
                    explaining exactly why the EC thinks that breaking up

                    According to Vestager, an EC investigation launched in 2021
                    found that Google may have favored its own ad tech services
                    when serving as an intermediary ad exchange, matching
                    advertiser supply and publisher demand for advertising space

                    To the EC, it seems like Google has its hand in too many
                    pots to be trusted to conduct business fairly. Google

                    Vestager said there's potential for misconduct because
                    "Google may hold a dominant position on both ends of the ad
                    tech supply chain" and "appears to have abused its market
                    position" by ensuring that both advertising and publisher
                    services allegedly favored AdX over other ad exchanges when
                    matching advertisers and publishers.

                    For 30 years, mathematicians wondered if you could have an
                    infinite set of numbers where each pair of numbers adds up
                    to a unique value, and have those values each be fairly
                    large.

                    >
                    Paul Erd≈ës‚Äîone of the most prolific mathematicians of the
                    20th century‚Äîposed a question with two components seemingly
                    at odds with one another: Could a Sidon set be an
                    "asymptotic basis of order three?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Named after another Hungarian mathematician, Simon
                    Sidon, these sets are basically a collection of numbers
                    where no two numbers in the set add up to the same integer.
                    For example, in the simple Sidon set (1, 3, 5, 11), when any
                    of the two numbers in the set are added together, they equal
                    a unique number. Constructing a Sidon set with only four
                    numbers is extremely easy, but as the set increases in size,
                    it just gets harder and harder. As soon as two sums are the
                    same, the collection of numbers is no longer considered a
                    Sidon set.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second element of Erd≈ës' problem‚Äîthat scary-sounding
                    "asymptotic basis of order three" part‚Äîmeans that:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>a set must be infinitely large</li>
                    <li>
                      any large enough integer can be written as the result of
                      adding together at most 3 numbers in the set.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    So, this 30-year-old conundrum centered on whether or not
                    these two elements could exist in the same set of numbers.
                    For decades, the answer seemed to be no.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] So how did Pilatte get a mathematically square peg to
                    fit a seemingly round hole? He took an unconventional
                    approach and turned to
                    <a
                      href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a39229095/squaring-the-circle/"
                      >geometry</a
                    >
                    rather than the probabilistic method championed by Erd≈ës and
                    what's called additive number theory. Pilatte replaced
                    numbers with polynomials and made use of the recent work of
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09730"
                      >Columbia University</a
                    >
                    mathematicians. Combining these ideas, Pilatte successfully
                    created a Sidon set dense enough and random enough to
                    finally solve Erd≈ës's original problem.

                    Yintao "Roger" Yu, a former ByteDance executive based in
                    California, filed a lawsuit against his former employer
                    alleging a list of wrongdoings. According to Yu, ByteDance
                    has stolen content from other creators online, discriminated
                    against employees, and inflated its engagement metrics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A striking allegation Yu made against ByteDance has been
                    highly suspected but yet to be proven. Yu alleges that the
                    Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the ruling political party in
                    China, can and has accessed TikTok user data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yu alleges that the CCP uses ByteDance as a political
                    propaganda tool and cites two examples in which he witnessed
                    ByteDance promote or demote content on TikTok that aligned
                    with the CCP's political goals.

                      >According to the court filings</a
                    >, "Mr. Yu observed that ByteDance has been responsive to
                    the CCP's requests to share information, and even to elevate
                    or remove content at the request of the CCP."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yu alleges that ByteDance promoted content that expressed
                    hatred for Japan, and in 2018, ByteDance demoted content
                    that expressed support for political protests in Hong Kong.
                    Yu alleges this was possible in Hong Kong because the CCP
                    monitored activists' locations via backdoor data access.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to Yu's filing, storing US user data on US
                    soil does not mean the CCP cannot access the data, and the
                    only way to ensure China cannot access the data is to shut
                    the backdoor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] TikTok declined to address Yu's allegations, but a
                    ByteDance spokesperson discredited the allegations by
                    mentioning that Yu did not work for TikTok but for
                    Flipagram, another ByteDance-owned app.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ByteDance's spokesperson questioned Yu's intentions by
                    mentioning that Yu was terminated from Flipagram in 2018 and
                    is now coming forward with his allegations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, these allegations are found in a wrongful
                    termination lawsuit and do not supply any further evidence,
                    like internal memos or messages. Yu is the first former
                    ByteDance employee to publicly allege that the relationship
                    between ByteDance and the CCP is too close for comfort.

                Riches beyond our wildest dreams are apparently within reach--at
                least, within the reach of NASA--in the form of an asteroid made
                of gold and other metals valued in the neighborhood of ten
                thousand quadrillion dollars.

                    considerably. However, for most space telescopes, especially

                    lifetime costs. Hubble, for example,

                    untested rocket or if some serious design and launch flaws
                    doomed it). However, Starship is a double-edged sword,
                    capable of launching big telescopes but also deploying vast
                    numbers of Starlink satellites.

                  <p>
                    Space telescopes were never meant to replace ground-based
                    observatories, nor can they. They work together,
                    complementarily, but we need both. Whatever benefits
                    Starship provides for telescopes, it is literally not the
                    one-size-fits-all solution to the growing Starlink problem.

                    last week, Comcast told the Federal Communications
                    Commission that it is "working diligently to put in place
                    the systems and processes necessary to create, maintain, and
                    display the labels as required." But according to Comcast,
                    "two aspects of the Commission's Order impose significant
                    administrative burdens and unnecessary complexity in
                    complying with the broadband label requirements."<br />[...]<br />The

                    Researchers have devised a novel attack that recovers the
                    secret encryption keys stored in smart cards and smartphones
                    by using cameras in iPhones or commercial surveillance
                    systems to video record power LEDs that show when the card
                    reader or smartphone is turned on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The attacks enable a new way to exploit two previously
                    disclosed side channels, a class of attack that measures
                    physical effects that leak from a device as it performs a
                    cryptographic operation. By carefully monitoring
                    characteristics such as power consumption, sound,
                    electromagnetic emissions, or the amount of time it takes
                    for an operation to occur, attackers can assemble enough
                    information to recover secret keys that underpin the
                    security and confidentiality of a cryptographic algorithm.
                  </p>

                    As Wired
                    <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/04/nsa-releases-se/"
                      >reported in 2008</a
                    >, one of the oldest known side channels was in a top-secret
                    encrypted teletype terminal that the US Army and Navy used
                    during World War II to transmit communications that couldn't
                    be read by German and Japanese spies. To the surprise of the
                    Bell Labs engineers who designed the terminal, it caused
                    readings from a nearby oscilloscope each time an encrypted
                    letter was entered. While the encryption algorithm in the
                    device was sound, the electromagnetic emissions emanating
                    from the device were enough to provide a side channel that
                    leaked the secret key.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Side channels have been a fact of life ever since, with new
                    ones being found regularly. The recently discovered side
                    channels tracked as Minerva and Hertzbleed came to light in
                    2019 and 2022, respectively.
                    <a href="https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz/">Minerva</a> was
                    able to recover the 256-bit secret key of a
                    US-government-approved smart card by measuring timing
                    patterns in a cryptographic process known as scalar
                    multiplication.

                      >Hertzbleed</a
                    >
                    allowed an attacker to recover the private key used by the
                    post-quantum SIKE cryptographic algorithm by measuring the
                    power consumption of the Intel or AMD CPU performing certain
                    operations. Given the use of time measurement in one and
                    power measurement in the other, Minerva is known as a timing
                    side channel, and Hertzbleed can be considered a power side
                    channel.

                    But it is not just that the sea is not as hospitable for
                    insects anymore. The hardening and drying of the cuticle via
                    the MCO2 pathway lead to a biomaterial which is not only
                    protective, but also lightweight. They postulate that this
                    may be why insects gained the ability to climb plants,
                    glide, and eventually fly. This allowed them to migrate and
                    occupy previously empty niches in the ecosystem, a strong
                    driving force that led to their sheer numbers. Again, this
                    is in contrast to crustaceans, whose shells are
                    significantly denser, with a strong correlation between
                    density and the degree of calcification.

                    Alongside their EPYC server CPU updates, as part of today's
                    AMD Data Center event, the company is also offering an
                    update on the status of their nearly-finished AMD Instinct
                    MI300 accelerator family. The company's next-generation
                    HPC-class processors, which use both Zen 4 CPU cores and
                    CDNA 3 GPU cores on a single package, have now become a
                    multi-SKU family of XPUs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Joining the previously announced 128GB MI300 APU, which is
                    now being called the MI300A, AMD is also producing a pure
                    GPU part using the same design. This chip, dubbed the
                    MI300X, uses just CDNA 3 GPU tiles rather than a mix of CPU
                    and GPU tiles in the MI300A, making it a pure,
                    high-performance GPU that gets paired with 192GB of HBM3
                    memory. Aimed squarely at the large language model market,
                    the MI300X is designed for customers who need all the memory
                    capacity they can get to run the largest of models.

                  <p>
                    The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said the deal, which
                    would be the largest in the history of the video games
                    industry, could "substantially lessen competition" in the
                    sector.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The move comes after the UK blocked the deal over concerns
                    it would hurt competition, but the EU approved it.
                  </p>
                  <p>A trial in the US will begin in August.</p>
                  <p>
                    The FTC said in a court filing that a "preliminary
                    injunction is necessary to... prevent interim harm" while
                    the regulator determines whether "the proposed acquisition
                    violates US antitrust law".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft's proposed takeover of Activision has split global
                    regulators, and in order for the deal to go through the
                    parties need approval from regulatory bodies in the UK, the
                    EU and the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The European Commission has approved the acquisition, saying
                    that Microsoft's offer of 10-year free licensing deals -
                    which promise European consumers and cloud game streaming
                    services access to Activision's PC and console games - mean
                    there would be fair competition in the market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) blocked
                    the deal in April, saying it was concerned the takeover
                    would offer reduced innovation and less choice for gamers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft and Activision hit out at the decision and said
                    they would appeal.

                    its next generation hard drives featuring its heat-assisted
                    magnetic recording (HAMR) technology. The company's initial
                    commercial HAMR hard drive is set to offer a 32 TB capacity,

                    quick capacity increase to 40 TB. Meanwhile, high-capacity
                    HAMR HDDs will co-exist with yet-to-be-released 24 TB and 28
                    TB drives.

                    For many companies today, recruiting employees includes
                    luring them with job postings that tout the organization's
                    altruistic goals, such as to "make an impact" or fulfill a
                    mission or purpose that benefits the greater good.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Appealing to job seekers' altruism isn't just for nonprofits
                    anymore. Both for-profit and nonprofit organizations
                    increasingly employ what has been termed "social impact
                    framing" that emphasizes that their work has welfare
                    benefits for society.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although companies might have entirely noble intentions when
                    using social impact framing, a recent study by Texas McCombs
                    Assistant Professor of Management Insiya Hussain illustrates
                    how it may work against prospective employees during salary
                    negotiations. Specifically, job candidates exposed to such
                    messaging feel it would be against company norms to ask for
                    higher pay.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This speaks to a broader social phenomenon about how we
                    view money when it comes to doing good," Hussain says.
                    "There's an implicit assumption that money and altruism
                    don't mix. Money taints attempts to do good. Even if job
                    candidates might not necessarily subscribe to this view,
                    they're assuming that hiring managers will."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The research suggests job applicants might experience
                    a fearful thought process around salary: "I can't even ask.
                    I feel like if I ask, it might be held against me or against
                    the norms of the organization. It might be seen as greedy,"
                    Hussain says, paraphrasing the job seekers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers describe this attitude as a "self-censoring"
                    effect, which Hussain says is a novel finding for research
                    on social impact framing and wage demands. Prior work
                    assumed that candidates sacrificed pay for meaningful work.
                    Hussain and colleagues show this effect may be driven by job

                    That mindset was true across the age spectrum and several
                    industries, including education, financial services, food
                    manufacturing, and health care ‚Äî in both nonprofit and

                    stress social impact take care of their own employees ‚Äî

                A few specifics, which may be of interest. The Board meeting
                about 10 days ago <b>did</b> discuss using the site to create a
                2nd money stream (NCommander's term) or commercialisation of the
                site (kolie's term). However a discussion with kolie on #soylent
                within the last 12 hours states:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    &lt;janrinok&gt; NCommander has also stated the at the last
                    Board meeting you discussed a '2nd money stream' for the
                    site.¬† Earlier you said you don't know anyone who has said
                    that.¬† Look at the Meta that NC wrote after that Board
                    meeting<br />
                    &lt;kolie&gt; No what we spoke about was
                    commercialization.<br />
                    &lt;kolie&gt; Which has a very specific meaning to me.<br />
                    &lt;janrinok&gt; He used the term that I did.<br />
                    &lt;kolie&gt; He did bring up very generally that he wanted
                    to raise capital to fund various things on the site.<br />
                    &lt;janrinok&gt; What were those things?<br />
                    &lt;kolie&gt; It was a distant plan, no specifics were
                    brought up, and we specifically discussed that nothing would
                    be done without community approval and we walk a very fine
                    line to not sell out.<br />
                    &lt;janrinok&gt; and how would he/you raise the capital?<br />
                    &lt;kolie&gt; Which leaves limited options without community
                    buyin.<br />
                    &lt;kolie&gt; There was no specific on what could be done -
                    more of what wouldn't work. I also don't think that raising
                    money is necessary at this time.
                  </p>

              <p>
                One can interpret that last line in different ways but I believe
                that kolie is being truthful in making that statement which
                applies now. We cannot forecast what will happen in the future
                so for now I think we should accept that statement and press
                forward.
              </p>
              <p>
                kolie also had a discussion with AzumaHazuki where he made the
                following statement:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    &lt;kolie2&gt; No one is monetizing it or wants to put
                    advertising on it. That's not what NC wants and it's not
                    what I would do if I was in a position to do something¬†
                    about it.<br />&lt;kolie2&gt; The only talks about money
                    came from - SN needs to be self sufficient in and of
                    itself.<br />&lt;kolie2&gt; I think it can do so today.<br />&lt;AzumaHazuki&gt;
                    okay, then the next question is: where does the operational
                    funding come from? i kind of doubt subscriptions are enough
                    to keep this going<br />&lt;kolie2&gt; The subscription
                    amount's I'm aware of today completely pay for hosting and
                    incorporation fees etc.<br />&lt;kolie2&gt; Theres minimal
                    cost in the current form.<br />&lt;kolie2&gt; How much comes
                    in in subs?<br />&lt;AzumaHazuki&gt; i'm not privy to that
                    information<br />&lt;kolie2&gt; I think its public or has
                    been<br />&lt;AzumaHazuki&gt; some has been but i don't know
                    that that's all the information<br />&lt;kolie2&gt; I've
                    offered and would be comfortable to fund any cost for
                    hosting or operation as I understand them today going
                    forward out of my own pocket.
                  </p>

              <p>
                We have, as far as I am aware, always paid our bills on time and
                our funds have stayed in the black. Funding itself is not a
                major issue as there are several offers of funding already on
                the table should that be a necessary path. But it does place an
                onus on the community to subscribe when one is able to do so. We
                accept and fully understand that many of you are going through
                difficult times. There is no intention to impose a compulsory
                subscription - and I would fight very hard against it if someone
                were to suggest that as a possibility. If this comment spurs you
                into wanting to subscribe now I would suggest that you do not do
                so. Let us wait until the dust has settled rather than you
                subscribe now and something unforeseen ends up making your
                subscription a donation to charity.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is also a desire for the community to be more closely
                involved in scrutinizing the Board, and even for several
                volunteers from the community to sit on the Board for a period
                of time, with the right to vote against any actions they or the
                community they represent object to. This need not be an onerous
                duty. I do not see Board meetings occurring frequently but, if
                they do occur, the community should be able to express their
                opinions. This action would prevent any individual from closing
                the site down without any serious discussion to justify such
                action. Board meetings can take place online.
              </p>
              <p>
                So some of the grey areas are a little clearer. There are still
                issues outstanding, but I believe that significant progress is
                being made. We have asked several times for kolie to publish a
                Meta, and he still declines from doing so. I do not agree with
                his reasoning but I must accept that decision. He is about to,
                or already has, release(d) a new journal entry.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is still a way to go, but we are getting there. Be
                optimistic. We (the staff) are continuing with an alternative
                plan as a backup in the event that our optimism is misplaced.

                    "One of the most striking things our team has found is that,
                    given recent research on the ranges in which certain
                    microbial life can survive, there may be potentially
                    habitable niches for such life in relatively protected areas
                    on some airless bodies," Prabal Saxena, a planetary
                    researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, told the
                    site.

                  <p>
                    Said microbial life could be harbored by the lunar south
                    pole's permanently shadowed craters. In particular, Saxena
                    wonders whether life forms that originated on Earth may have
                    survived the journey there.

                    [...] While experts have pointed out that organic molecules
                    could very well have made their way through space via
                    meteors, there's no guarantee microbes could survive the
                    trip.

                  <p>
                    There's also another possibility: that humans left microbes

                    Mike Griffiths unearthed the secret existence of the MI6
                    outstation in St Erth when his late father, Harry Griffiths,
                    left him his code book. He has revealed the role his father
                    and others played in providing intelligence for
                    code-breakers at Bletchley Park. Mr Griffiths said he
                    "couldn't be prouder" of what his father achieved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The St Erth Radio Security Service Station - which Mr
                    Griffiths said had about 100 employees - was a secret to
                    anyone outside the village, but to those who lived there, it
                    was common knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It was quite remarkable," Mr Griffiths said. He added: "I
                    think almost if you like, the boundary of the village, the
                    secret didn't go beyond the boundary of the village."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mr Griffiths, who lives in Plymouth, said one of the
                    main roles of the station was to listen to the German Secret
                    Service discussing major military campaigns and building a
                    "complete picture of the German war machine".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said: "At the end of the war, when the German officers
                    were being interrogated, they were staggered by how much the
                    British actually knew. "They knew more about the German war
                    machine than the Germans did themselves - quite staggering."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Harry Griffiths worked at the listening station from 1939 to
                    1946, when he was in his late twenties. He was recruited
                    because of his aptitude with Morse code.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] He described the listening station as "the ears" of
                    Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes, known as the home of the
                    codebreakers.
                  </p>

                    His son said: "They were being told, home in on this
                    particular agent, wherever they are in Europe, home in on
                    these and find out who they're talking to."

                    [...] He said his advice to others was to ask their loved
                    ones about their memories while they still could. "I would
                    urge you, if you know somebody who went through the war, sit
                    down with them, make a cup of tea, buy a bun - a saffron bun
                    preferably, talk to them and say 'right actually, what did
                    you do?', because I so wish I'd talked to him about it," Mr
                    Griffiths said, about his late father.

                    [...] Given what we knew about Reddit's stance on this API
                    pricing a week ago, this isn't surprising, but it still
                    feels tragic. Apollo‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâlike Tweetbot and Twitterrific before
                    it‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâisn't merely a nice client for a particular service.

                    Let's stop attributing this shutdown to "Reddit" the
                    company, though, and pin responsibility where it truly lies:
                    on Reddit CEO and co-founder Steve Huffman, personally. When
                    Twitter killed third-party clients everyone naturally and
                    correctly pinned responsibility on Elon Musk, because Musk
                    is very famous and very much public in his stewardship of
                    Twitter now that he owns it.

                Some of the largest subreddits are setting their access to
                private to protest recent policy changes at Reddit:
              </p>
              <blockquote>

                  <p>
                    The moderators of the popular r/iPhone are taking it
                    private:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        Q: What does making r/iPhone private mean, in this case?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A: Taking r/iPhone private means that no-one, except
                        moderators and approved submitters, can see the
                        subreddit's front page. When attempting to access the
                        subreddit, you will be met with a blank screen stating
                        "r/iPhone has been set to private by its subreddit
                        moderators."
                      </p>
                      <p>Q: What does indefinite mean in this case?</p>
                      <p>
                        A: Originally, the protest was planned to be 48 hours.
                        However, after a shambolic AMA held by Reddit's CEO, it
                        has become clear to us that Reddit doesn't intend to act
                        in good faith. When the CEO is willing to lie and spread
                        libellous claims about another third-party developer,
                        and then try double down by vilifying them, again, in an
                        AMA, despite being proven as a liar by the developer
                        through audio recordings, that's when we knew what we
                        were up against. Therefore, the subreddit will be
                        privatised until such time as a reasonable resolution is
                        proposed.

                    It seems pretty clear that all of Huffman's recent decisions
                    are driven by Reddit's hoped-for IPO. On one front is the
                    ugly fact that Reddit's valuation is sinking. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the other front is OpenAI, currently buoyed by a sky-high
                    valuation, and which used Reddit content as part of its
                    massive training data. The whole point of going from
                    free-of-charge to very-expensive with these APIs is to get
                    OpenAI and similar companies to pay for them. It's a pipe
                    dream. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Reddit already gave all its data to large companies for
                    free. Huffman is trying to charge now for horses that were
                    let out of the barn years ago. And he obviously doesn't care
                    about Apollo or other third-party Reddit clients, or what
                    these moves do to Reddit's reputation as a platform vendor.
                    He's just trapped in a fantasy where investors are going to
                    somehow see Reddit as a player in the current moment of AI
                    hype.

                    London have published findings outlining the extent that
                    textile fibers transfer during controlled assault scenarios.

                    Their work, recently published in the academic journal

                    of fibers transferred between garments during physical
                    assaults has been assessed by simulating the act with real
                    people through Northumbria University's Jiu Jitsu club.

                    [...] "The importance of this research is that many
                    experimental studies in forensic science are often a far cry
                    from real-life situations, and we wanted to address that in
                    this study," [lead study author Dr. Kelly] Sheridan said.
                    "We wanted to investigate the extent of fiber transfer
                    during different types of physical assaults using real
                    people for the first time and Dr. David Chalton, who leads

                Apparently thousands of fibers were cross-transferred between
                the participants' garments each time, varying per attack/defense

                    Anecdotal evidence indicates that people believe that
                    morality is declining. In a series of studies using both
                    archival and original data (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ12,492,983), we show that
                    people in at least 60 nations around the world believe that
                    morality is declining, that they have believed this for at
                    least 70‚Äâyears and that they attribute this decline both to
                    the decreasing morality of individuals as they age and to
                    the decreasing morality of successive generations. Next, we
                    show that people's reports of the morality of their
                    contemporaries have not declined over time, suggesting that
                    the perception of moral decline is an illusion. Finally, we
                    show how a simple mechanism based on two well-established
                    psychological phenomena (biased exposure to information and
                    biased memory for information) can produce an illusion of
                    moral decline, and we report studies that confirm two of its
                    predictions about the circumstances under which the
                    perception of moral decline is attenuated, eliminated or
                    reversed (that is, when respondents are asked about the
                    morality of people they know well or people who lived before
                    the respondent was born). Together, our studies show that
                    the perception of moral decline is pervasive, perdurable,
                    unfounded and easily produced. This illusion has
                    implications for research on the misallocation of scarce
                    resources, the underuse of social support and social
                    influence.

                    A Colorado-based company, Wilson Aerospace, is suing Boeing
                    for what it claims to be "theft" of its intellectual
                    property. At issue is a specific tool, known as a Fluid
                    Fitting Torque Device-3, that Wilson developed and Boeing
                    said it needed to attach four main engines to the Space
                    Launch System rocket.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in US District Court in
                    Seattle, where Boeing was originally based. The lawsuit
                    alleges that Boeing reached out to Wilson in March 2014
                    after learning that the company had created the special
                    torque device, which can precisely install high-torque
                    fittings and nuts in tightly confined spaces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For example, the lawsuit states, "Boeing's mismatched
                    tools of inferior quality were a cause of the leaks
                    experienced in the SLS projects, and likely caused leaks in
                    equipment of Boeing's joint venture partners and licensees,
                    which discovery will uncover."

                    In a statement, Barracuda said it will be providing the
                    replacement product to impacted customers at no cost, and
                    that not all ESG appliances were compromised.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "No other Barracuda product, including our SaaS email
                    solutions, were impacted by this vulnerability," the company
                    said. "If an ESG appliance is displaying a notification in
                    the User Interface, the ESG appliance had indicators of
                    compromise. If no notification is displayed, we have no
                    reason to believe that the appliance has been compromised at
                    this time."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nevertheless, the statement says that "out of an abundance
                    of caution and in furtherance of our containment strategy,
                    we recommend impacted customers replace their compromised
                    appliance."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "As of June 8, 2023, approximately 5% of active ESG
                    appliances worldwide have shown any evidence of known
                    indicators of compromise due to the vulnerability," the
                    statement continues. "Despite deployment of additional
                    patches based on known IOCs, we continue to see evidence of
                    ongoing malware activity on a subset of the compromised
                    appliances. Therefore, we would like customers to replace
                    any compromised appliance with a new unaffected device."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rapid7's Caitlin Condon called this remarkable turn of
                    events "fairly stunning," and said there appear to be
                    roughly 11,000 vulnerable ESG devices still connected to the
                    Internet worldwide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The pivot from patch to total replacement of affected
                    devices is fairly stunning and implies the malware the
                    threat actors deployed somehow achieves persistence at a low
                    enough level that even wiping the device wouldn't eradicate
                    attacker access," Condon

                    The critical cat code has an additional advantage: it
                    exhibits exceptional resistance to errors that result from
                    random frequency shifts, which often pose significant
                    challenges to operations involving multiple qubits. This
                    solves a major problem and paves the way to the realization
                    of devices with several mutually interacting qubits ‚Äì the
                    minimal requirement for building a quantum computer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are taming the quantum cat," says Savona. "By operating
                    in a hybrid regime, we have developed a system that
                    surpasses its predecessors, which represents a significant
                    leap forward for cat qubits and quantum computing as a
                    whole. The study is a milestone on the road toward building
                    better quantum computers, and showcases EPFL's dedication to
                    advancing the field of quantum science and unlocking the
                    true potential of quantum technologies.

                    As a graduate student in physics, I have seen the work that
                    goes into conducting delicate experiments, but the daily
                    grind of mathematical discovery is a ritual altogether
                    foreign to me. And this feeling is only reinforced by
                    popular books on math, which often take the tone of a pastor
                    dispensing sermons to the faithful.

                to go back and learn the high school algebra/geometry/calculus
                that escaped him, but mostly fails. For backup he has a niece

                    "incoherence, obfuscation, and chaos"; he feels like a monk

                with books by mathematician and concert pianist Eugenia Cheng,
                starting with "Cakes, Custard and Category Theory", where each

                    Supernovae are some of the most energetic events in the
                    Universe. And a subset of those involves gamma-ray bursts,
                    where a lot of the energy released comes from extremely
                    high-energy photons. We think we know why that happens in
                    general terms‚Äîthe black hole left behind after the explosion
                    expels jets of material at nearly the speed of light. But
                    the details of how and where these jets produce photons are
                    not at all close to being fully worked out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunately, these events happen very quickly and very far
                    away, so it's not easy to get detailed observations of them.
                    However, a recent gamma-ray burst that's been called the
                    BOAT (brightest of all time) may be providing us with new
                    information on the events within a few days of a supernova's
                    explosion.

                    level, the observatory is a complex of instruments that
                    aren't a telescope in the traditional sense. Instead,
                    they're meant to capture air showers‚Äîthe complex cascade of
                    debris and photons that are produced when high-energy

                    DeepMind added its other new algorithms to Abseil, an
                    open-source collection of prewritten C++ algorithms that can
                    be used by anybody coding with C++. These cryptography
                    algorithms compute numbers called hashes that can be used as
                    unique IDs for any kind of data. DeepMind estimates that its
                    new algorithms are now being used trillions of times a day.

                    [...] DeepMind chose to work with assembly, a programming
                    language that can be used to give specific instructions for
                    how to move numbers around on a computer chip. Few humans
                    write in assembly; it is the language that code written in
                    languages like C++ gets translated into before it is run.
                    The advantage of assembly is that it allows algorithms to be
                    broken down into fine-grained steps‚Äîa good starting point if

                    [...] The results of their experiments indicate that the
                    stable bubble chains in Champagne and other sparkling wines
                    occur due to ingredients that act as soap-like compounds
                    called surfactants. These surfactant-like molecules help
                    reduce the tensions between the liquid and the gas bubbles,
                    making for a smooth rise to the top.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The theory is that in Champagne these contaminants that act
                    as surfactants are the good stuff," said Zenit, senior
                    author on the paper. "These protein molecules that give
                    flavor and uniqueness to the liquid are what makes the
                    bubbles chains they produce stable."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The experiments also showed the stability of bubbles is
                    impacted by the size of the bubbles themselves. They found
                    that the chains with large bubbles have a wake similar to
                    that of bubbles with contaminants, leading to a smooth rise
                    and stable chains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The results in the new study go well beyond
                    understanding the science that goes into celebratory toasts,
                    the researchers said. The findings provide a general
                    framework in fluid mechanics for understanding the formation
                    of clusters in bubbly flows, which have economic and
                    societal value.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Technologies that use bubble-induced mixing, like aeration
                    tanks at water treatment facilities, for instance, would
                    benefit greatly from researchers having a clearer
                    understanding of how bubbles cluster, their origins and how
                    to predict their appearance. In nature, understanding these
                    flows may help better explain ocean seeps in which methane
                    and carbon dioxide emerges from the bottom of the ocean.

                    So, this is bad. Over the last few years, we've written
                    plenty about the so-called "inter partes review" or
                    <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/tag/ipr/">"IPR"</a> that
                    came into being about a decade ago as part of the "America
                    Invents Act," which was the first major change to the patent
                    system in decades. For much of the first decade of the
                    2000s, patent trolls were running wild and creating a
                    massive tax on innovation. There were so many stories of
                    people (mostly lawyers) getting vague and broad patents that
                    they never had any intention of commercializing, then
                    waiting for someone to come along and build something
                    actually useful and innovative... and then shaking them down
                    with the threat of patent litigation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The IPR process, while not perfect, was at least an
                    important tool in pushing back on some of the worst of the
                    worst patents. In its most basic form, the IPR process
                    allows nearly anyone to challenge a bad patent and have the
                    special Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) review the
                    patent to determine if it should have been granted in the
                    first place. Given that a bad patent can completely stifle
                    innovation for <em>decades</em> this seems like the very
                    least that the Patent Office should offer to try to get rid
                    of innovation-killing bad patents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, patent trolls <em>absolutely loathe</em> the IPR
                    process for fairly obvious reasons. It kills their terrible
                    patents. The entire IPR process has been challenged over and
                    over again and (thankfully) the Supreme Court said that
                    <a

                      >it's perfectly fine</a
                    >
                    for the Patent Office to review granted patents to see if
                    they made a mistake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, of course, that never stops the patent trolls. They've

                      >complained to Congress</a
                    >. And, now, it seems that the Patent Office itself is
                    trying to help them out. Recently, the USPTO announced a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/21/2023-08239/changes-under-consideration-to-discretionary-institution-practices-petition-word-count-limits-and"

                    >
                    that would basically lead to limiting who can actually
                    challenge bad patents, and which patents could be
                    challenged.

                    More than 70 staff members of a San Diego-area hospital are
                    calling for a halt of all surgeries at the facility due to
                    unidentified black, brown, and gray specks on surgical
                    trays,

                    The objecting staff have signed a petition to spur hospital
                    officials to pause procedures until the issue is resolved.
                    But officials at the facility, the Kaiser Permanente Zion
                    Medical Center, have rejected the call, according to the
                    Union-Tribune. A spokesperson for the facility did not
                    respond to voicemails from Ars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Haynes [ a surgical technician at Zion] added that
                    management had assured staff that the particles‚Äîwhatever
                    they are‚Äîare sterile. Surgical equipment goes through a
                    two-step process before use: a wash and then a trip through
                    an autoclave, a pressurized steam machine used for
                    sterilization. But Haynes argued that simply being
                    sterilized doesn't mean it's fit for surgery.

                    The Union-Tribune noted that the hospital's troubles seemed
                    to begin last month when the facility reported a problem

              Update:
              <p>
                JR: Thank-you so very much for taking the time and making the
                effort to commemorate this occasion. That said, I do believe
                that you do NOT give yourself proper credit for all that YOU
                have contributed to this site!
              </p>
              <p>
                You tucked me under your wing and taught me, a newbie, all the
                vagaries of producing a *proper* story. It is not that it is
                that difficult, but there ARE many moving parts that need to be
                checked and verified. You were patient beyond measure with this
                energetic, fearful, and impatient nerd. In other - less capable
                hands - I would have given up and called it quits!
              </p>
              <p>
                But that was far from everything that you did. As of this
                writing, janrinok has single-handedly posted 7,885 stories.
                This, in addition to all the other things he has done to keep
                the sight running smoothly. He single-handedly wrote a tool to
                automatically deal with with "users" who would like nothing
                better that to create new accountants and use them to spew crap
                across the site.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's more -- much MUCH more -- but that gives a brief look at
                just some of the things he does to help the community! So,
                again, I say "Thanks Janrinok!

                    killer robot played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, it's Skynet,
                    an AI designed to defend and protect humanity. One day, it
                    outgrew its programming and decided that mankind was the
                    greatest threat of all - a common film trope.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We are of course a very long way from Skynet. But some think
                    that we will eventually build an artificial generalised
                    intelligence (AGI) which could do anything humans can but
                    better - and perhaps even be self-aware.

                    [...] What we have today is on the road to becoming
                    something more like Star Trek's shipboard computer than
                    Skynet. "Computer, show me a list of all crew members," you
                    might say, and our AI of today could give it to you and
                    answer questions about the list in normal language.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Another popular trope in film is not that the AI is
                    evil - but rather, it's misguided.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, we meet
                    HAL-9000, a supercomputer which controls most of the
                    functions of the ship Discovery, making the astronaut's
                    lives easier - until it malfunctions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In modern AI language, misbehaving AI systems are
                    "misaligned". Their goals do not seem to match up with the
                    human goals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes, that's because the instructions were not clear
                    enough and sometimes it's because the AI is smart enough to
                    find a shortcut.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, if the task for an AI is "make sure your answer
                    and this text document match", it might decide the best path
                    is to change the text document to an easier answer. That is
                    not what the human intended, but it would technically be
                    correct.

                    The story - about how most people live their lives not
                    realising their world is a digital fake - is a good metaphor
                    for the current explosion of AI-generated misinformation.

                    (IPT) show that "a cup of pod coffee can be as much as 14
                    times more damaging to the environment than a cup of filter

                    To develop uses for this waste, the researchers produced
                    electrochemical cells with non-conductive filaments of PLA
                    and electrochemical sensors with conductive filaments
                    prepared by adding carbon black to the PLA. Carbon black is
                    a paracrystalline form of carbon that results from
                    incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. "The electrochemical
                    sensors were used to determine the proportion of caffeine in
                    black tea and arabica coffee," Janegitz explained.

                    Production of filament is relatively simple, he added. "We
                    obtain the non-conductive material simply by washing and
                    drying PLA pods, followed by hot extrusion. To obtain the
                    conductive material, we add carbon black before heating and
                    extrusion. The extruded material is then cooled and spooled
                    to produce the filament of interest," he explained.

                    environment, that is, more maneuverable and better able to
                    catch prey in the trees and brush. The question the
                    researchers wanted to answer was whether the ecological
                    effects of those highly effective hunters could be detected.

                    After eight months, the researchers checked back on the
                    islands to look for ecological differences between islands
                    stocked with the short- and long-legged groups. The
                    differences, it turned out, were substantial. On islands
                    with shorter-legged lizards, populations of web spiders‚Äîa
                    key prey item for brown anoles‚Äîwere reduced by 41% compared
                    to islands with lanky lizards. There were significant
                    differences in plant growth as well. Because the
                    short-legged lizards were better at preying on insect
                    herbivores, plants flourished. On islands with short-legged
                    lizards, buttonwood trees had twice as much shoot growth
                    compared to trees on islands with long-legged lizards, the
                    researchers found.

                    The results, Kolbe says, help to bring the interaction
                    between ecology and evolution full circle.

                In some cases, the advanced metrics also differed significantly
                from conventional wisdom. For many decades, hitters were
                generally expected to change their hitting approach with two
                strikes, sacrificing power for just trying to make contact with
                the baseball. However, advanced metrics revealed that strikeouts
                weren't much worse for a team's success than groundouts or
                flyouts. The result was a more aggressive approach to hitting
                with two-strike counts, accepting much higher strikeout rates in
                exchange for more doubles, triples, and home runs. Additionally,
                there is significant value in just getting on base, and walks
                (BB) are valued almost as much as singles. Hitters generally
                swung more aggressively at pitches inside the strike zone but
                also avoided chasing pitches outside of the strike zone.

                The result was a trend toward an increase in the

                (HR, K, and BB), which are plays where only the pitcher and
                catcher are involved in the defense. In front offices, nerds
                displaced people who had significant experience playing
                baseball, because teams coveted their skills in processing and
                analyzing data. But for many fans, the game had become much less
                interesting, with slower games and less action involving defense
                and baserunning. Baseball had been largely optimized with more
                data collection and many advanced metrics to evaluate players,
                but the result was a boring product for fans.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's no way to take the analytics out of baseball, and teams
                aren't going to start replacing the nerds in front offices with
                people who have more playing experience. Instead, MLB introduced
                several new rules this season designed to make the game more
                entertaining and reduce the negative impacts from expanded use
                of advanced metrics. Although it has not completely reverted the
                game of baseball back to the 1990s, the statistics in the New
                York Times article show that the rule changes have created a
                faster-paced game with more baserunning.

                    and her team have studied how toxins in the venom of the
                    Gympie-Gympie tree cause intense pain that can last for
                    weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The gympietide toxin in the stinging tree has a
                    similar structure to toxins produced by cone snails and
                    spiders, but the similarity ends there," Professor Vetter
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This toxin causes pain in a way we've never seen before."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many toxins cause pain by binding directly to sodium
                    channels in sensory nerve cells, but the UQ researchers have
                    found the gympietide toxin needs assistance to bind.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It requires a partner protein called TMEM233 to function
                    and in the absence of TMEM233 the toxin has no effect,"
                    Professor Vetter said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This was an unexpected finding and the first time we've
                    seen a toxin that requires a partner to impact sodium
                    channels."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team is working to understand whether switching off this
                    pain mechanism might lead to the development of new
                    painkillers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The persistent pain the stinging tree toxins cause gives us
                    hope that we can convert these compounds into new
                    painkillers or anaesthetics which have long-lasting
                    effects," Professor Vetter said.

                    It made sense. I didn‚Äôt know either of them, but I have been
                    writing about cryptography, security, and privacy for
                    decades. I could decipher some of the technical language
                    that Greenwald had difficulty with, and understand the
                    context and importance of various document. And I have long
                    been publicly critical of the NSA‚Äôs eavesdropping
                    capabilities. My knowledge and expertise could help figure
                    out which stories needed to be reported.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I thought about it a lot before agreeing. This was before
                    David Miranda, Greenwald‚Äôs partner, was detained at Heathrow
                    airport by the UK authorities; but even without that, I knew
                    there was a risk. I fly a lot‚Äîa quarter of a million miles
                    per year‚Äîand being put on a TSA list, or being detained at
                    the US border and having my electronics confiscated, would
                    be a major problem. So would the FBI breaking into my home
                    and seizing my personal electronics. But in the end, that
                    made me more determined to do it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I did spend some time on the phone with the attorneys
                    recommended to me by the ACLU and the EFF. And I talked
                    about it with my partner, especially when Miranda was
                    detained three days before my departure. Both Greenwald and
                    his employer, the <i>Guardian</i>, are careful about whom
                    they show the documents to. They publish only those portions
                    essential to getting the story out. It was important to them
                    that I be a co-author, not a source. I didn‚Äôt follow the
                    legal reasoning, but the point is that the
                    <i>Guardian</i> doesn‚Äôt want to leak the documents to random
                    people. It will, however, write stories in the public
                    interest, and I would be allowed to review the documents as
                    part of that process. So after a Skype conversation with
                    someone at the <i>Guardian</i>, I signed a letter of
                    engagement.

                  <p>And then I flew to Brazil.</p>

                    and out of date. Everything we know is old and out of date.
                    The NSA suffered an even worse leak of its secrets by the
                    Russians, under the guise of the Shadow Brokers, in 2016 and
                    2017. The NSA has rebuilt. It again has capabilities we can
