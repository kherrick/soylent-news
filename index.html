                    On Wednesday, Guinness World Records presented NASA teams at
                    the Kennedy Space Center with a certificate confirming that,
                    at a whopping 6.65 million pounds (3 million kilograms),
                    Crawler Transporter 2 is the world's heaviest self-powered
                    vehicle, NASA announced in a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-rocket-transporter-crawls-into-history-books-with-world-record"

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Anyone with an interest in machinery can appreciate the
                    engineering marvel that is the crawler transporter," Shawn
                    Quinn, program manager of Exploration Ground Systems, said
                    in the statement. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "NASA's crawlers were incredible pieces of machinery when
                    they were designed and built in the 1960s," John Giles,
                    NASA's Crawler Element Operations manager, said in the
                    statement. "And to think of the work they've accomplished
                    for Apollo and shuttle and now Artemis throughout the last
                    six decades makes them even more incredible."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due to how heavy the Crawler Transport is, the vehicle
                    essentially crawls its way to the launch pad. It takes about
                    eight to 12 hours for the rocket-carrying vehicle to drive
                    the 4.2 miles (6.7 kilometers) from the Vehicle Assembly
                    Building to the launch pad, going at a slow and steady speed
                    of one mile per hour (1.6 kilometers per hour). It could
                    take you a shorter time to walk that distance by foot.

                    <li>
                      Google Assistant saw eight major speaker/smart display
                      hardware releases in five years from 2016-2021, but the
                      hardware releases seem to have stopped. The last hardware
                      release was in March 2021. That was two full years ago.

                      Google Assistant has never made money. The hardware is
                      sold at cost, it doesn't have ads, and nobody pays a
                      monthly fee to use the Assistant. There's also the
                      significant server cost to process all those voice
                      commands, though some newer devices have moved to
                      on-device processing in a stealthy cost-cutting move. The
                      Assistant's biggest competitor, Amazon Alexa, is in the
                      same boat and loses

                [...] The bill could have implications not just for social
                networks, but potentially security tools such as virtual private
                networks (VPNs) that consumers use to encrypt and route their
                traffic, one said. Although the intention of the bill is to
                target apps or services that pose a threat to national security,
                these critics worry it may have much wider implications for the
                First Amendment.
              </p>
              <p>
                "The RESTRICT Act is a concerning distraction with insanely
                broad language that raises serious human and civil rights
                concerns," Willmary Escoto, U.S. policy analyst for digital
                rights organization Access Now told Motherboard in an emailed
                statement. [...]
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] Under the RESTRICT Act, the Department of Commerce would
                identify information and communications technology products that
                a foreign adversary has any interest in, or poses an
                unacceptable risk to national security, the announcement reads.
                The bill only applies to technology linked to a "foreign
                adversary." Those countries include China (as well as Hong
                Kong); Cuba; Iran; North Korea; Russia, and Venezuela.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bill's language includes vague terms such as "desktop
                applications," "mobile applications," "gaming applications,"
                "payment applications," and "web-based applications." It also
                targets applicable software that has more than 1 million users
                in the U.S.
              </p>
              <p>
                "The RESTRICT Act could lead to apps and other ICT services with
                connections to certain foreign countries being banned in the
                United States. Any bill that would allow the US government to
                ban an online service that facilitates Americans' speech raises
                serious First Amendment concerns," Caitlin Vogus, deputy
                director of the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology's Free
                Expression Project, told Motherboard in an emailed statement.
                "In addition, while bills like the RESTRICT Act may be motivated
                by legitimate privacy concerns, banning ICT services with
                connections to foreign countries would not necessarily help
                protect Americans' privacy. Those countries may still obtain
                data through other means, like by purchasing it from private
                data brokers." [...]

                    At issue is whether Amazon's series of Alexa-powered smart
                    speakers were collecting data on children under the age of
                    13 without parental consent and retaining it even after
                    users attempted to delete it, which children's advocacy
                    organizations asked the FTC look into back in 2019, the
                    report said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now the FTC is now recommending issuing a complaint that
                    Amazon didn't confirm parental consent before collecting
                    data and that most of the Alexa activities designed for kids
                    didn't have a privacy policy, sources told Bloomberg. The
                    Justice Department could take the next step and file a
                    lawsuit against Amazon next month.

                    Amazon reportedly claimed to be in compliance with the

                    because sound science is critical for making decisions on
                    how forests are managed. It's premature to base forest
                    practices and policies on CMNs per se, without further
                    evidence. And failing to identify misinformation can erode

                  <p>
                    [...] Like the previous major revision,
                    <a
                      href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf"
                      >C11</a
                    >, the latest standard introduces several useful features.
                    The most important, if not the most exciting, make it easier
                    to write safe, correct, and secure code. For example, the
                    new header standardizes checked integer arithmetic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] C23 also adds new features to protect secrets from
                    prying eyes and programmers from themselves. The new
                    memset_explicit() function is for erasing sensitive
                    in-memory data; unlike ordinary memset, it is intended to
                    prevent optimizations from eliding the erasure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In addition to these new correctness and safety aids,
                    C23 provides many new conveniences: Constants true, false,
                    and nullptr are now language keywords; mercifully, they mean
                    what you expect. The new typeof feature makes it easier to
                    harmonize variable declarations. The preprocessor can now
                    #embed arbitrary binary data in source files.
                    Zero-initializing stack-allocated structures and
                    variable-length arrays is a snap with the new standard "={}"
                    syntax.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Sadly, good news isn't the only news about C23. The
                    new standard's nonfeatures, misfeatures, and defeatures are
                    sufficiently numerous and severe that programmers should not
                    "upgrade" without carefully weighing risks against benefits.
                    Older standards such as C99 and C11 weren't perfect, but
                    detailed analysis will sometimes conclude that they are
                    preferable to C23.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    In other words, the publishing industry's repeated
                    insistence that ebooks must not be shared has spilled over
                    into the world of physical books. To the credit of the
                    authors in this particular case, when they found out about
                    the notice, they explained that it was

                    >, and that: "It was not checked or approved by us and is

                    reasons mentioned at the beginning of this post, it is
                    actually in the publisher's interest to encourage the
                    sharing of ebooks, since it represents a powerful marketing
                    approach that will drive new sales. The copyright world's
                    obsessions with control at any cost means that they are
                    failing to enjoy these opportunities, and that authors are
                    losing revenue as a result.

                    [...] The team whittled down a population of 1.5 million
                    stars to about 18,000 early stars with low metallicity
                    located in the Milky Way's bulge. "A decade ago, I was
                    thrilled to have a sample of almost 1,000 low-metallicity
                    bulge stars," said
                    <a href="http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~mkness/Home.html"
                      >Melissa Ness</a
                    >, an astronomer at Columbia University. "We are now in a
                    regime of having many thousands of these metal-poor stars.
                    That's an incredible data set to work with."

                    The researchers still needed to answer at least one more
                    question: Where were the proto-galaxy's stars headed? The
                    answer came from another type of measurement newly available
                    in the Gaia DR3 release — the speed at which the stars are
                    moving along our line of sight. Knowing this velocity made
                    it possible to uncover each star's orbit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What emerged was a portrait of a halo-shaped proto-galaxy,
                    as anticipated by some theorists. The population of elderly,
                    metal-poor stars orbited in a small, tight sphere with a
                    radius of 9,000 light-years, which the team dubbed the "poor
                    old heart" of the Milky Way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, the findings suggest that the proto-galaxy didn't
                    steal stars from other galaxies. If it had, their stellar
                    orbits would be headed toward regions beyond the Milky Way.

                    An industry shift toward multi-die design could be part of
                    the solution to these challenges. Instead of a single
                    monolithic chip ("system on chip"), multi-die designs
                    consist of a collection of chips (chiplets or dies) linked
                    in a sophisticated package ("systems of chips"), which can
                    include stacking blocks in a 3D configuration for greater
                    density. Multi-die system designs are capable of supporting
                    the rollout of AI/ML at scale, and they can improve silicon
                    yields, reducing waste during chip manufacturing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When it comes to the business use cases for multi-die
                    systems, Patrick Moorhead, founder, CEO, and chief analyst
                    at global technology consulting firm Moor Insights &amp;
                    Strategy, notes that these custom designs may soon be a key
                    differentiator for companies looking to stand out among
                    competitors. "As more people are looking at more custom
                    silicon as a way to differentiate what they bring to the
                    table, that's what businesspeople should be looking at," he
                    says. "Chiplets enable smaller companies with smaller
                    pocketbooks to use semiconductors for unique competitive
                    advantage."

                  of millions of sites</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Hackers have been exploiting a critical vulnerability in a
                popular WordPress plugin called 'Loginizer' that allows them to
                take full control of affected sites. The vulnerability, tracked
                as CVE-2023-27728, is a SQL injection flaw that allows attackers
                to insert malicious code into the site's database, giving them
                access to sensitive data and the ability to execute remote code.
                Loginizer is installed on millions of WordPress sites, and the
                vulnerability affects all versions up to and including 1.6.5.
                The plugin is designed to provide security features such as
                two-factor authentication and brute-force protection.
              </p>
              <p>
                Security researchers have identified multiple hacking groups
                actively exploiting the vulnerability in recent weeks. The
                attackers are scanning the internet for WordPress sites that
                have the vulnerable plugin installed and are using automated
                tools to inject malicious code into the site's database. Once a
                site is compromised, the attackers can use it for various
                malicious purposes, such as stealing user data or distributing
                malware.
              </p>
              <p>
                The plugin's developers have released a patch for the
                vulnerability, and WordPress site owners are advised to update
                their installations immediately. However, given the widespread
                use of the plugin, it is likely that many sites remain
                vulnerable to exploitation. Loginizer is just one of many
                WordPress plugins that have been found to have security flaws in
                recent years, highlighting the importance of regular security
                updates and monitoring for site owners.

                The keynote speakers were Arun Gupta, Dr. Kitty Yeung, and Ken
                Thompson. There were nearly 100 sessions covering everything
                from open government to embedded, security, and FOSS@HOME to
                name only a few. Ceph, DevOps LA, Kubernetes and PostgreSQL also
                had presences at the event. Ken Thompson's keynote covered
                several topics including a long running project of his regarding
                music playback, which now includes a Raspberry Pi powered
                jukebox with tens of thousands of albums available. For the
                older material, the jukebox does playback through a player
                piano.

                    "Crescent is well positioned to serve the upcoming wave of
                    lunar science and exploration missions, including NASA's
                    crewed Artemis moon landings," said Crescent CEO Joe Landon.
                    Before being tapped to lead Crescent, Landon was Lockheed
                    Martin's VP and GM for lunar infrastructure services. Being
                    well positioned, we note, does not mean the company will
                    actually get an award.

                  <p>
                    Crescent said it plans to launch the first satellites of the
                    Parsec constellation in 2025, with will add more nodes over
                    time. We asked Lockheed Martin if it or Crescent had been in
                    talks with NASA to make a parsec into more than just a
                    measure of space smuggling efficiency, and a Lockheed Martin
                    spokesperson told us the company isn't under contract right
                    now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Lockheed Martin believes so strongly in the future of the
                    lunar economy that we have invested our own money in
                    developing the first two Parsec satellites needed for
                    Crescent's fundamental lunar communications and navigation
                    services," the company spokesperson told us in an email.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lockheed Martin said Parsec spacecraft are funded and in
                    development, and reiterated that the company is still
                    operating with a baseline launch date of 2025.

                    We're all familiar with the elements of the periodic table,
                    but have you ever wondered what hydrogen or zinc, for
                    example, might sound like? W. Walker Smith, now a graduate
                    student at Indiana University, combined his twin passions of
                    chemistry and music to create what he calls a new
                    audio-visual instrument to communicate the concepts of
                    chemical spectroscopy.

                    the American Chemical Society being held this week in
                    Indianapolis, Indiana. Smith even featured audio clips of
                    some of the elements, along with "compositions" featuring
                    larger molecules, during a performance of his "The Sound of

                    involving Nishimura, Good Smile, and Tokyo-based
                    telecommunications firm Dwango. The three parties, the
                    document said, were in talks to acquire 4chan. In December,
                    The New York Times confirmed that Nishimura purchased 4chan
                    with funding from

                    When asked about Good Smile's involvement in 4chan last
                    December in an interview with publisher Shueisha, Nishimura

                    >. He and Good Smile's president, Takanori Aki, had met at
                    an anime convention and become friends, Nishimura said.
                    "However, Good Smile Company is in the process of leaving."

                    Good Smile did not respond to WIRED's request for

                      >fine sites that host antisemitism</a
                    >, in addition to other types of hate. Given 4chan's rampant
                    hate speech, it's a move that could hit them particularly
                    hard. But any action against 4chan requires, or is at least
                    enormously helped by, knowing who actually owns and runs the
                    site. Now that 4chan's ownership and funding is in the
                    public record, the temperature may start to increase on
                    Nishimura.

                    "I think Mr. Kawakami's description of Mr. Nishimura is fair
                    and quite accurate," Sei says. "Kawakami described Nishimura
                    as a child who tears the legs off from a bug. And that he
                    enjoys that."

                If you still want your Mao memorabilia, you better hurry down to

                >
                is somewhat comparable to the Cabinet. Headed by the Prime
                Minister and consisting of the heads of the various Ministries
                (Defense, Commerce, Education, Agriculture and Rural Affairs,
                Justice, Civil Affairs, State Security, Public Security and so
                on), it handles the day-to-day running of the country while
                formulating economic policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Its operational procedures are described in a document,
                conveniently titled "Working Procedures for the State Council".
                On March 18, an updated version of that document was published,
                and it has
                <a

              <p>
                First off, the State Council now has to
                <i
                  >"report any major decisions, major events and important
                  situations"</i
                >
                to the Central Committee <i>"in a timely manner."</i> Previous
                edition sentences like
                <i
                  >"administration according to law, seeking truth from facts,
                  democracy, openness, pragmatism and integrity"</i
                >
                have been scrapped, as has the requirement for the State Council
                <i
                  >"to correct illegal or inappropriate administrative
                  actions"</i
                >, or to <i>"guide and supervise"</i> the bureaucracy. In other
                words, its wings have been seriously clipped.
              </p>
              <p>
                Secondly, any and all references to Marxism/Leninism, Mao Zedong
                Thought, the thought of Deng Xiaoping and the ideologies of
                former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao are now
                <i>verboten</i>. Only references to Xi Jinping Thought are
                allowed, as that is
                <i
                  >"the essence of Chinese culture and the spirit of the
                  times"</i

              <p>
                To drive the point home, the Central Committee of the CCP
                launched another nationwide disciplinary campaign among its 96
                million members.

                This round will check them for loyalty to supreme leader Xi

                    A federal judge yesterday ruled that Google intentionally
                    destroyed evidence and must be sanctioned, rejecting the
                    company's argument that it didn't need to automatically
                    preserve internal chats involving employees subject to a

                    evidentiary hearing that featured witness testimony and
                    other evidence, the Court concludes that sanctions are
                    warranted," US District Judge James Donato wrote. Later in
                    the ruling, he wrote that evidence shows that "Google
                    intended to subvert the discovery process, and that Chat
                    evidence was 'lost with the intent to prevent its use in

                    AI image generator Midjourney has halted free trials of its
                    service, blaming a sudden influx of new users. Midjourney
                    CEO and founder David Holz announced the change on Tuesday,

                    "extraordinary demand and trial abuse" in a message on
                    Discord (this announcement was
                    <a
                      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/30/midjourney-ai-image-generation-rules/"
                      >spotted first by <em>The Washington Post</em></a
                    >). In an email to The Verge, Holz stated that the pause is
                    "because of massive amounts of people making throwaway
                    accounts to get free images."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We think the culprit was probably a viral how-to video in
                    china," said Holz over email. "This happened at the same
                    time as a temporary gpu shortage. The two things came
                    together and it was bringing down the service for paid
                    users."

                  <p>
                    Given Holz's reference to "abuse," it was originally thought
                    that the pause was linked to a spate of recent viral images
                    created using Midjourney, including fabricated

                    >, which some mistook for real photographs. However, Holz
                    characterized earlier reports as a "misunderstanding" and
                    notes that the free trial of Midjourney never included
                    access to the latest version of Midjourney,
                    <a href="https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/model-versions"
                      >version 5</a
                    >, that creates the most realistic images and which is
                    thought to have been used for these viral pictures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Midjourney maintains a list of banned words "related
                    to topics in different countries based on complaints from
                    users in those countries," as
                    <a
                      href="https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/989270517401911316/1028855696084697099"
                      >per a message from Holz last October</a
                    >. But it doesn't share a complete version of this list to
                    minimize "drama." As Holz said last year, "Almost no one
                    ever notices [the ban list] unless they're specially trying
                    to create drama which is against our rules in tos [terms of
                    service] 'don't use our tools to create drama.'"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] At the time of writing, Midjourney is still not
                    allowing free users to generate images, though this may
                    change in the future. "We're still trying to figure out how
                    to bring free trials back, we tried to require an active
                    email but that wasn't enough so we're back to the drawing
                    board," said Holz.

                    [...] In a climate where industries are bickering about who
                    is and isn't allowed to create nitrogen emissions, farmers
                    groups argue that priority should be given to the farmers,
                    whose operations they say were made illegal overnight by a
                    2019 change in nitrogen rules. "Only after these
                    agricultural entrepreneurs are legalized can they use
                    freed-up nitrogen space for the construction of data centers
                    or anything else for that matter," says Job Knobbout,
                    spokesperson for the Netherlands Agricultural and
                    Horticultural Association (LTO).

                    Opposition to datacenter development is growing, in the
                    Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. When Meta proposed
                    building the Netherlands' biggest data center yet in the
                    municipality of Zeewolde, locals <a
                      href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-dutch-data-center/"
                      >rallied against the project</a
                    >
                    until the whole plan was called off. Farmers were
                    influential in this debate as well. "With Zeewolde, in
                    particular, the data center would have taken away land that
                    was actually being rented out by the government to farmers,
                    to give that to a multinational company," says Karin van Es,
                    associate professor of media studies at Utrecht University,
                    who has studied the data center debate. "So that created a
                    lot of tension."

                    [...] Ruiter says he's continued to talk about data centers
                    because he wants to remind people that "the cloud" they've
                    come to rely on isn't just an ethereal concept—it's
                    something that has a physical manifestation, here in the
                    farmland of North Holland. He worries that growing demand
                    for data storage from people, and <a

                    "Of course, we need some data centers," he says. But he
                    wants us to talk about restructuring the way the internet
                    works so they are not so necessary. "We should be having the
                    philosophical debate of what do we do with all our data? I
                    don't think we need to store everything online in a central
                    place."

                    German company Isar Aerospace has raised $165 million in
                    order to ramp up the development of its Spectrum rocket,
                    which is scheduled for its debut launch later this year. For
                    Europeans needing access to space, the rocket's arrival will
                    come not a moment too soon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Isar Aerospace has raised a total of $330 million so
                    far, with $75 million raised during its previous round of
                    funding in July 2021. The funds will go towards the
                    development of Isar's Spectrum rocket, a two-stage launch
                    vehicle designed to carry small and medium sized satellites
                    to orbit. According to ISAR, Spectrum should be capable of
                    carrying 2,205 pounds (1,000 kilograms) to low Earth orbit
                    (LEO). By comparison, SpaceX's medium-lift Falcon 9 can
                    hoist 50,265 pounds (22,800 kg) to LEO.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Spectrum's inaugural launch is planned for the second half
                    of 2023. Isar Aerospace is currently running tests on the
                    rocket's Aquila engine, which was developed and manufactured
                    in-house. The company is also finalizing its infrastructure
                    at the launch site in Andøya, Norway, which will host
                    Spectrum's debut liftoff.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Europe is desperately in need of its own launch
                    vehicles, whether for small or medium lift, to provide local
                    access to space. Spectrum won't be the most powerful rocket
                    when it debuts, but it'll fill a troublesome gap, especially
                    until Vega-C and Ariane 6 come through.

                    Italy's right-wing government has backed a bill that would

                    protecting the environment from carbon emissions and food

                    Holy smokes. A group of astronomers have found a black hole
                    containing (checks notes) 30 billion times the mass of our
                    Sun. That's more than seven thousand times the size of the
                    supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.

                    The team used gravitational lensing to see the black hole.
                    In this natural phenomenon, massive objects' gravitational
                    fields bend photons of light magnifying and warping
                    them—making it possible to see object that would otherwise
                    be hidden or too faint. Last year,

                    depending on the presence of black holes of varying mass.
                    They then compared the computer data with images of the
                    cosmos taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Lo and behold,

                    inactive black holes, something not currently possible in

                    let us detect many more black holes beyond our local
                    universe and reveal how these exotic objects evolved further

                    or even competitor Amazon's Luna, but the library's breadth
                    and quality is roughly on par with Apple Arcade and is
                    admittedly a nice bonus on top of your subscription that's
                    easy to miss, if a confusing direction for the company—we're
                    not sure anybody should subscribe to Netflix for the games,
                    at least right now.

                    By putting its games on TVs, Netflix could boost their
                    discoverability and maybe make its gaming branch more of a
                    legitimate selling point. The code's reference to using a
                    phone as a controller does imply that the move would still
                    be limited to Netflix's current mobile game lineup, which
                    would still leave it behind more robust console selections
                    from competing game services, but would also keep the
                    service lightweight and allow it to be played across more
                    platforms, as it does not currently rely on streaming from
                    the cloud. We are curious, though, if Netflix will allow for
                    more traditional controllers in games that support them.

                    "Since aspirin is a COX inhibitor, this suggests potential
                    interplay between COX and IDO1 during inflammation," Mandel
                    said.

                    This interplay could be important for treating other kinds
                    of illness beyond the typical indications for aspirin, the
                    researchers say. They note that some immunotherapy
                    treatments, which try to strengthen the immune system's
                    response to cancer, also target IDO1. So it's possible that
                    future COX/IDO1 inhibitors might be feasible as
                    immunotherapy drugs.

                    This sort of basic research is crucial for drug development,
                    but it's still the very beginning of the road. Mandel and
                    his team say that they're now trying to create small
                    molecules in the lab that similarly inhibit COX/IDO1, which
                    they will test out as potential anti-inflammatory and
                    immunotherapy drugs.

                captcha services need to stay one step ahead. The slider method
                was found to be easily bypassed. Rotating puzzle pieces is
                harder to solve but involves more user interaction and has

                to click on the center of an owl's head. This is an improvement
                over selecting a type of ball from a grid of 9 or going through

                    We should conclude that organizational security must not
                    rely heavily on securing the user, that they will be
                    compromised, and then begin securing systems with this
                    assumption in mind. Thus, even if an end user is breached,
                    the amount of systemic damage that's done by that compromise
                    shouldn't be large if proper security measures are employed
                    and orchestrated correctly.

                    As Apple's major chip manufacturer TSMC nears the opening of
                    its Arizona plant, US officials want it to build more — but
                    US versus China politics are complicating matters.

                    Taiwanese company TSMC has already invested

                    with Taiwan, TSMC faces double taxation on its profits from
                    this or any other factory it could build in the States.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the <em>Financial Times</em>, unless there is a
                    change in the law, TSMC will be
                    <a
                      href="https://www.ft.com/content/743a9cfa-c6a1-4f89-8c24-8607414e6900"

                    over 50% of its profits earned in the US. In comparison,
                    Samsung pays much less because its home country of South
                    Korea has a tax treaty with the States.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Naturally, then, US politicians who want to see the firm
                    expand in the States argue that President Biden should
                    negotiate a tax accord with Taiwan. TSMC officials have
                    reportedly also asked for such an agreement to ease this
                    double taxation burden.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, at present the US does not recognize Taiwan as a
                    separate country or sovereign nation. Instead, it sees it as
                    part of China.

                    Furthermore, the report speculates that such energy could be
                    "propagated with low loss through air for tens to hundreds
                    of meters, and with some loss, through most building
                    materials." This could potentially be done using "commercial
                    off-the-shelf technology" and devices exist that "are easily
                    portable and concealable, and can be powered by standard
                    electricity or batteries," it states.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The report is really interesting but it's also [sort of]
                    funny because it appears to say the exact opposite of what
                    the government just came out and told everybody less than a
                    month ago. On March 1st, Haines told journalists that most
                    cases of Havana Syndrome could likely be attributed to
                    "environmental factors" or "conventional illnesses." The
                    notion that the symptoms would've been caused by a "directed
                    energy weapon" was considered "highly unlikely" in most
                    instances, Haines told the public. While she and other
                    officials left the door open for alternative explanations,
                    the press conference seemed like a clear attempt to shut
                    down further speculation about the bizarre episodes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But far from waving off victims' symptoms as the result of
                    "environmental factors" or some sort of mass delusion, the
                    recently declassified report refers to Havana Syndrome as a
                    "unique neurosensory syndrome" that is "distinctly unusual,"
                    and is "unreported elsewhere in the medical literature."
                    Aside from the "electromagnetic energy" explanation, it also
                    seems to dismiss most of the other theories that have been
                    posited to explain the syndrome's genesis."

                    While prices for computer hardware have remained relatively
                    high in the past few years, the slowing of PC and component
                    sales are starting to take effect. DRAM is the latest piece
                    of hardware to become even cheaper, and projections show
                    that prices will continue to fall in the coming months.

                    from TrendForce, DRAM prices have fallen 20% in the first
                    quarter of 2023. This is a continued decline for the DRAM
                    market as sales have been slowing for all sectors of the
                    industry. Some DRAM manufacturers have already

                    >
                    as they see their revenues on a steep decline. For the
                    second quarter of 2023, TrendForce says that prices are
                    expected to fall another 10 to 15%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite production cuts already in effect, PC makers still
                    have between 9 and 13 weeks of DRAM inventory. The mobile
                    sector seems to be having healthier levels of inventory as
                    mobile manufacturers were more conservative in their plans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nonetheless, mobile DRAM pricing is also expected to decline
                    by 10 to 15%. As consumer demand for DRAM was sluggish,
                    suppliers looked to the server side of the business for
                    sales, however this simply resulted in a huge pile-up of
                    inventory for server DRAM.

                    are being sought as a climate solution because they have a
                    smaller carbon footprints than conventional fossil fuels
                    used to power planes. They are made from materials including
                    waste cooking oils, woody debris, manure, algae and crops.

                  <p>
                    One of sustainable aviation fuel's biggest selling points is
                    the fuel can replace jet fuel in existing aircraft, making
                    it a quicker way to cut carbon emissions from flights. Other
                    clean aviation strategies such as electric- or
                    hydrogen-powered aircraft are still being developed and
                    approved by regulators, and the aircraft in the works are
                    smaller planes — not transcontinental jets.

                    Many Washington state companies and institutions have taken
                    steps to support the plant-based fuels.

                    Blanchard says the team was conducting standard experiments
                    designed to better understand the basic properties of
                    liquid-state salts (also known as ionic liquids). The team
                    found that two different room-temperature ionic liquids each
                    generated electricity when a piston squeezed them within a
                    cylinder. The strength of the effect the researchers
                    observed was directly proportional to the force applied.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It shocked the hell out of us to see that," Blanchard says.
                    "Nobody had ever seen the piezoelectric effect in liquids
                    before."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Blanchard and his colleagues found that the optical
                    properties of these ionic liquids could alter dramatically
                    in response to electric current. For instance, when the
                    researchers placed these fluids in a lens-shaped container,
                    they found that an electric charge could modify how much the
                    liquids bent light, "changing the focal length of the lens,"
                    Blanchard says.

                    before the end of 2023. We put a man on the moon in 1969,
                    and now the Finnish Telecom company wants to give the rock

                    helping aid in lunar discoveries, not to mention developing

                    all 50 team members who were developing the company's
                    metaverse strategies have been let go.

                    The metaverse was a pet project of former CEO Bob Chapek,
                    who
                    <a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Last November, however, Chapek was unceremoniously
                    dismissed from Disney. And Bob Iger returned to the CEO
                    role, quickly

                  <p>
                    The metaverse ambitions appear to be the latest to be
                    targeted by Iger. Despite the many ideas that were publicly
                    floated, the metaverse unit had apparently not made much
                    progress on the new technology and did not have many clear
                    plans in place.

                Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist who has been called "the

                    The computer scientist sat down with CBS News this week
                    about his predictions for the advancement of AI. He compared
                    the invention of AI to electricity or the wheel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hinton, who works at Google and the University of Toronto,
                    said that the development of general purpose AI is
                    progressing sooner than people may imagine. General purpose
                    AI is artificial intelligence with several intended and
                    unintended purposes, including speech recognition, answering
                    questions and translation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Until quite recently, I thought it was going to be like 20
                    to 50 years before we have general purpose AI. And now I
                    think it may be 20 years or less," Hinton predicted. Asked
                    specifically the chances of AI "wiping out humanity," Hinton
                    said, "I think it's not inconceivable. That's all I'll say."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Hinton said it was plausible for computers to
                    eventually gain the ability to create ideas to improve
                    themselves.

                    [...] The Webb is so sensitive that it enabled an entirely
                    different sort of observation. Most attempts at imaging
                    exoplanet atmospheres rely on light from the host star that
                    grazes the planets, and thus would pass through any
                    atmosphere that's there. This relies on the planet passing
                    in front of the host star.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This new work relies on the planet passing
                    <em>behind</em> the host star—having the star eclipse the
                    planet, in other words. Shortly before and after that
                    happens, the telescope will receive light from both the star
                    itself and any light that's emitted or reflected by the
                    planet. This sort of "secondary eclipse" is difficult to
                    detect, given that the star is so much brighter. In
                    addition, the Webb's detectors are sensitive to wavelengths
                    that would allow it to detect any carbon dioxide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This initial work focused on the innermost planet,
                    TRAPPIST-1b, where the star would be roughly 1,000 times
                    brighter than any light we should see from the planet. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The work used the drop in light caused by the secondary
                    eclipse to infer what portion of the light outside the
                    eclipse was coming from the planet. This light would be a
                    mix of reflected light and heat given off the planet, which
                    is baked by roughly four times the radiation that Earth
                    receives from the Sun. But, by imaging in the infrared, most
                    of what's being detected is primarily the heat radiated off
                    the planet. By assuming this is approximately a
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation"
                      >black body radiation</a
                    >, it's possible to estimate the temperature of the planet
                    needed to produce that radiation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This produced a result of about 500 K, or 230° C, which
                    tells us there's probably no atmosphere.

                    While the web-tracking pixels ostensibly aim to better
                    pinpoint advertising, they also pose threats for privacy,
                    security experts have said. They can sometimes be configured
                    to collect data that users enter on websites, such as
                    usernames, addresses and other sensitive information. With
                    enough pixels on enough websites, the companies running them
                    can begin to piece together the browsing behavior of
                    individual users as they move from domain to domain,
                    building detailed profiles on their interests and online
                    habits.

                  <p>
                    [...] Beyond TikTok, Feroot also found tracking pixels from
                    Chinese-owned companies such as Tencent Holdings Ltd., which
                    owns WeChat, Weibo Corp., and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. on
                    some state-government websites, as well as Russian-owned
                    pixels from companies such as from cybersecurity company
                    Kaspersky, which had its products banned from civilian and
                    military federal U.S. networks during the Trump
                    administration due to espionage fears.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Feroot found that the average website it studied had
                    more than 13 embedded pixels. Google's were far and away the
                    most common, with 92% of websites examined having some sort
                    of Google tracking pixel embedded. About 50% of the websites
                    the firm examined had Microsoft Corp. or Facebook pixels.
                    TikTok had a presence in less than 10% of sites examined.

                    Privacy advocates have long raised concerns about the
                    proliferation of pixels, whatever their provenance. Alan
                    Butler, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy
                    Information Center, said the data can be used to identify
                    individuals, track them physically and digitally, and
                    subject them to common cybersecurity threats, such as
                    phishing attempts and disinformation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Any social media platform, data broker, or ad service that
                    is using tracking pixels to monitor people's browsing across
                    the web is violating the privacy of users visiting those
                    websites," Mr. Butler said. "This is especially troubling on
                    government websites where individuals are being tracked even
                    as they try to access information and services that are
                    essential."

                    While the data doesn't suggest that poliovirus is again
                    circulating widely in the region, health officials are wary
                    that the virus could easily restart. Rockland has one of the

                    Officials are concerned about the potential for
                    international spread of polio to Rockland's sizable Jewish
                    community during upcoming holiday travel.

                    offering free polio boosters at walk-in clinics, working
                    with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to audit
                    vaccination coverage at day cares and schools, and trying to

                    Neurotechnologies today—devices that can measure and
                    influence our brains and nervous systems—are growing in
                    power and popularity. The neurotech marketplace, according
                    to Precedence Research, is worth USD $14.3 billion this year
                    and will exceed $20 billion within four years. Noninvasive
                    brain-computer interfaces, brain stimulation devices, and
                    brain-monitoring hardware (measuring alertness and attention
                    at work, for example) are no longer just laboratory
                    experiments and technological curios. The societal and legal
                    implications of widespread neurotech adoption may be
                    substantial.

                  <p>
                    Nita Farahany, professor of law and philosophy at Duke
                    University, has written a new book, [...] which explores how
                    our lives may be impacted by the use of brain-computer
                    interfaces and neural monitoring devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Farahany argues that the development and use of neurotech
                    presents a challenge to our current understanding of human
                    rights. Devices designed to measure, record and influence
                    our mental processes, used by us or on us, may infringe on
                    our rights to mental privacy, freedom of thought, and mental
                    self-determination. She calls this collection of freedoms
                    the right to cognitive liberty. Spectrum spoke with Farahany
                    recently about the future and present of neurotech and how
                    to weigh its promises—enhanced capabilities, for instance,
                    including bionics and prosthetics and even a third
                    arm—against its potential to interfere with people's mental
                    sovereignty.

                    from Hacker News in which someone <em>joked</em> about this
                    happening, and someone else used ChatGPT to write fake news
                    coverage about the event.

                    (*I say "right now" because in the time between starting and
                    finishing writing this story, Bing changed its answer and
                    now correctly replies that Bard is still live. You can
                    interpret this as showing that these systems are, at least,
                    fixable <em>or</em> that they are so infinitely malleable

                    chatbots are unable to gauge reliable news sources, misread
                    stories about themselves, and misreport on their own
                    capabilities. In this case, the whole thing started because
                    of a single joke comment on Hacker News. Imagine what you
                    could do if you <em>wanted</em> these systems to fail.

                    It's a laughable situation but one with potentially serious
                    consequences. Given the inability of AI language models to
                    reliably sort fact from fiction, their launch online
                    threatens to unleash a rotten trail of misinformation and
                    mistrust across the web, a miasma that is impossible to map
                    completely or debunk authoritatively. All because Microsoft,
                    Google, and OpenAI have decided that market share is more
                    important than safety.

                    Are you among the few people still using Windows 7, 8, or
                    8.1 and playing games via Steam? If so, you might want to
                    upgrade to a newer version of Microsoft's OS before January
                    1, 2024, as that's the date Valve is terminating Steam
                    support for those older operating systems.

                  <p>
                    Valve made the surprise announcement in a Steam support
                    <a
                      href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4784-4F2B-1321-800A"
                      >post</a
                    >. It writes that as of January 1, 2024, Steam will
                    officially stop supporting the Windows 7, Windows 8, and
                    Windows 8.1 operating systems. After that date, the Steam
                    Client will no longer run on those versions of Windows. In
                    order to continue running Steam and any games or other
                    products purchased through Steam, users will need to update
                    to a more recent version of Windows. Or they could always
                    switch to Linux.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Valve's reasoning for dropping Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 is due
                    to Steam relying on an embedded version of Google Chrome,
                    which no longer functions on older versions of Windows. The
                    company adds that future versions of Steam will require
                    Windows feature and security updates only present in Windows
                    10 and above.

                    It was just last month when Chrome 110 was released, the

                    Valve's decision – assuming they weren't planning on
                    upgrading in the next nine months. The survey results show
                    that 1.43% of participants still use Windows 7 64-bit, while
                    0.34% use Windows 8.1 64-bit and 0.09% use Windows 7.

                    However, in this latest instance, it's believed that nobody
                    has actually tasted one of the mammoth meatballs.

                    the Guardian newspaper, Professor Ernst Wolvetang, from the

                    Queensland which worked with Vow in this project, suggested
                    that it's probably not safe to try the meatball just now,
                    even if regulators permitted it.

                    "We haven't seen this protein for thousands of years,"

                    would react when we eat it. But if we did it again, we could
                    certainly do it in a way that would make it more palatable

                    The new regulation allows the government to ban a particular
                    vendor's spyware from being used by agencies, if the
                    company's product is found to have contributed to human
                    rights violations, has been used to target U.S. citizens, or
                    has been wielded against activists or journalists. In
                    essence, the government is using its presence as a major
                    consumer of defense and security products as a cudgel to
                    encourage surveillance firms to behave or face blacklisting.

                    The announcement comes amidst revelations that more U.S.
                    officials have been targeted by spyware than previously
                    believed. On the same day that the executive order was
                    announced, a senior US administration staffer told reporters
                    that as many as 50 American officials are suspected or
                    confirmed to have been targeted by commercial spyware in
                    recent years. Previous reporting on this subject has focused
                    on a handful of diplomats in foreign countries who had
                    allegedly been targeted for surveillance. The new tally
                    shows that, in reality, the imprint of foreign campaigns
                    aimed at U.S. officials may be much broader.

                    "Commercial spyware – sophisticated and invasive cyber
                    surveillance tools sold by vendors to access electronic
                    devices remotely, extract their content, and manipulate
                    their components, all without the knowledge or consent of
                    the devices' users – has proliferated in recent years with
                    few controls and high risk of abuse," the White House's

                    poses distinct and growing counterintelligence and security
                    risks to the United States, including to the safety and

                    AI assistant. The plugins give ChatGPT the ability to
                    interact with the wider world through the Internet,
                    including booking flights, ordering groceries, browsing the
                    web, and more. Plugins are bits of code that tell ChatGPT
                    how to use an external resource on the Internet.

                  <p>
                    Basically, if a developer wants to give ChatGPT the ability
                    to access any network service (for example: "looking up
                    current stock prices") or perform any task controlled by a
                    network service (for example: "ordering pizza through the
                    Internet"), it is now possible, provided it doesn't go
                    against OpenAI's rules.

                  <p>
                    Conventionally, most large language models (LLM) like
                    ChatGPT have been constrained in a bubble, so to speak, only
                    able to interact with the world through text conversations
                    with a user. As OpenAI writes in its introductory

                    on ChatGPT plugins, "The only thing language models can do
                    out-of-the-box is emit text."

                    Humans are social creatures. But what leads to them being
                    this way? To fully understand how the brain gives rise to
                    social behaviors, we need to investigate it during social
                    encounters. Moreover, we need to analyze not only the
                    internal operations of one brain during social activities
                    but also the dynamic interplay between multiple brains
                    engaged in the same activity. This emerging research field
                    is referred to as "second-person neuroscience" and employs
                    hyperscanning (the simultaneous recording of the activity of
                    multiple brains) as the signature technique.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Now, a research team led by Yasuyo Minagawa of Keio
                    University, Japan, has worked out an elegant solution to
                    this problem. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each pair of participants (39 pairs in total) engaged in a
                    natural, cooperative, and creative task: the design and
                    furnishing of a digital room in a computer game. They were
                    allowed to communicate freely to create a room that
                    satisfied both. The participants also completed the same
                    task alone as the researchers sought to compare
                    between-brain synchronizations (BBSs) and within-brain
                    synchronizations (WBSs) during the individual and
                    cooperative tasks. The social behavior that the team focused
                    on during the tasks was eye gaze, that is, whether the
                    participants directed their gaze at the other's face. They
                    automatically extracted this behavior from the video footage
                    using an open-source software, which made the data analysis
                    easier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the most intriguing findings of the study was that,
                    during cooperative play, there was a strong BBS among the
                    superior and middle temporal regions and specific parts of
                    the prefrontal cortex in the right hemisphere, but little
                    WBS in comparison. Moreover, the BBS synchronization was
                    strongest when one of the participants raised their gaze to
                    look at the other. Interestingly, the situation reversed
                    during individual play, showing increased WBS within the
                    same regions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Minagawa, these results agree with the idea
                    that our brains work as a "two-in-one system" during certain
                    social interactions. "Neuron populations within one brain
                    were activated simultaneously with similar neuron
                    populations in the other brain when the participants
                    cooperated to complete the task, as if the two brains
                    functioned together as a single system for creative
                    problem-solving," she explains. "These phenomena are
                    consistent with the notion of a 'we-mode,' in which
                    interacting agents share their minds in a collective fashion
                    and facilitate interaction by accelerating access to the
                    other's cognition."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, this study provides evidence hinting at the
                    remarkable capability of the human brain to understand and
                    synchronize with others' when the situation calls for it.

                    We don't yet know if the amount of plastic that humans
                    ingest might be enough to shape our microbiomes. People
                    ingest a lot less plastic than seabirds do, says Richard
                    Thompson, a professor of marine biology at the University of
                    Plymouth in the UK. The amount of plastic that gets into our
                    bodies also depends on where we live and work. People who
                    work in textile factories will have a higher exposure than
                    those who work outdoors, for example.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And we don't know the consequences of ingesting microbes
                    that cling to the microplastics that get into our bodies.
                    Humans are already exposed to plenty of disease-causing
                    microbes that aren't on plastics, Thompson points out. For
                    example, we might worry that tiny bits of plastic might pick
                    up nasty bugs in wastewater, and that these might somehow
                    end up in our bodies. But wastewater overflows regularly
                    contaminate beaches and drinking water directly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There's a chance microbes that break down plastic will end
                    up residing in our guts too. It's difficult to know how—or
                    whether—this will affect us. Microbes can evolve quickly,
                    and they can swap genes with neighboring bugs. "Are we going
                    to evolve to eat plastic? My answer would likely be no,"
                    says Fackelmann. But the possibility that our guts will
                    become home to more microbes that can break down plastic is
                    "not beyond the realm of possibility," she says.

                    will have to delete your local GitHub SSH key, and fetch new
                    ones.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the blog post describes, the first symptom is an alarming
                    warning message[.]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For almost everyone, this warning is spurious. It's not that
                    you're being attacked – although that is always a
                    <em>remote</em> (<a
                      href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ha_ha_only_serious"
                      >ha ha, only serious</a
                    >) possibility – it's that GitHub revoked its old keys and
                    published new ones. Hanlon's Razor applies, as it most often
                    does:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately
                    explained by stupidity. (The word <em>stupidity</em> is
                    often replaced with <em>incompetence</em>, but then, one
                    does tend to lead to the other.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This time, the reason was – as usual – plain old human
                    error. Someone published GitHub's
                    <strong>private</strong> RSA keys in a repository on GitHub
                    itself. If you're unclear how SSH encryption works, about
                    public versus private keys, or the different cryptographic
                    algorithms SSH uses, there are many good
