                    for IEEE Spectrum, cognitive scientist Gary Marcus and
                    artist Reid Southen showed that generative image models
                    produce a wide range of potentially infringing images—not
                    only of copyrighted characters from video games and cartoons
                    but near-perfect copies of stills from movies like Black
                    Widow, Avengers: Infinity War, and Batman v Superman.

                    In its lawsuit against OpenAI, the New York Times provided
                    100 examples of GPT-4 generating long, near-verbatim
                    excerpts from Times articles

                    [...] Those who advocate a finding of fair use like to split
                    the analysis into two steps, which you can see in
                    <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-journalism"
                      >OpenAI's blog post</a

                    about The New York Times lawsuit. OpenAI first categorically
                    argues that "training AI models using publicly available
                    Internet materials is fair use." Then in a separate section,
                    OpenAI argues that "'regurgitation' is a rare bug that we
                    are working to drive to zero."

                    But the courts tend to analyze a question like this
                    holistically; the legality of the initial copying depends on
                    details of how the copied data is ultimately used.

                    Regardless of the application, machine learning models are
                    only as good as the data you feed them. A bias in the data,
                    even an unconscious one, can affect the conclusions made by
                    the algorithm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Machine learning models currently being used for pHLA
                    binding prediction assert that they can extrapolate for
                    allele data not present in the dataset those models were
                    trained on, calling themselves "pan-allele" or "all-allele."
                    The Rice team's findings call that into question.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What we are trying to show here and kind of debunk is the
                    idea of the 'pan-allele' machine learning predictors," Conev
                    said. "We wanted to see if they really worked for the data
                    that is not in the datasets, which is the data from
                    lower-income populations."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fasoulis' and Conev's group tested publicly available data
                    on pHLA binding prediction, and their findings supported
                    their hypothesis that a bias in the data was creating an
                    accompanying bias in the algorithm. The team hopes that by
                    bringing this discrepancy to the attention of the research
                    community, a truly pan-allele method of predicting pHLA
                    binding can be developed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ferreira, faculty advisor and paper co-author, explained
                    that the problem of bias in machine learning can't be
                    addressed unless researchers think about their data in a
                    social context. From a certain perspective, datasets may
                    appear as simply "incomplete," but making connections
                    between what is or what is not represented in the dataset
                    and underlying historical and economic factors affecting the
                    populations from which data was collected is key to
                    identifying bias.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Researchers using machine learning models sometimes
                    innocently assume that these models may appropriately
                    represent a global population," Ferreira said, "but our
                    research points to the significance of when this is not the
                    case." He added that "even though the databases we studied
                    contain information from people in multiple regions of the
                    world, that does not make them universal. What our research
                    found was a correlation between the socioeconomic standing
                    of certain populations and how well they were represented in
                    the databases or not."

                    Google has initiated significant layoffs across its various
                    teams, [...] marking a continuation of the tech industry's
                    trend towards reducing workforce expenses. The layoffs have
                    affected hundreds of employees within the Voice Assistant
                    unit; hardware teams responsible for Pixel, Nest and Fitbit
                    products; and a considerable portion of the augmented
                    reality (AR) team. This move is part of Google's broader
                    effort to streamline operations and align resources with its
                    most significant product priorities​​.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] This comes at a time when Google parent, Alphabet
                    Inc., reported record profits in late January. The company
                    reported $20.4 billion in net income in Q4.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] The layoffs have sparked widespread concern among
                    Google employees, not just about job security but also about
                    the ethical implications of their work, especially as the
                    company continues to invest heavily in advancing AI
                    technology.

                    PLPs [ protein-like polymers], developed by Gianneschi's
                    team, could represent a significant breakthrough in halting
                    or reversing damage offering hope for improved treatments
                    and outcomes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Focusing on the challenge of activating processes crucial
                    for the body's antioxidant response, the team's research
                    offers a novel solution. The team provides a robust,
                    selective method enabling enhanced cellular protection and
                    offering a promising therapeutic strategy for a range of
                    diseases including neurodegenerative conditions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Through modern polymer chemistry, we can begin to think
                    about mimicking complex proteins," Gianneschi said. "The
                    promise lies in the development of a new modality for the
                    design of therapeutics. This could be a way to address
                    diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's among others where
                    traditional approaches have struggled."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This approach not only represents a significant advance in
                    targeting transcription factors and disordered proteins, but
                    also showcases the PLP technology's versatility and
                    potential to revolutionize the development of therapeutics.
                    The technology's modularity and efficacy in inhibiting the
                    Keap1/Nrf2 interaction underscore its potential for impact
                    as a therapeutic, but also as a tool for studying the
                    biochemistry of these processes.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    In a paper published in the <em>Astronomical Journal</em>, a
                    team of researchers from the SETI Institute, Berkeley SETI
                    Research Center and the University of Washington reported an
                    exciting development for the field of astrophysics and the
                    search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), using
                    observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
                    (TESS) mission to monitor the SETI Ellipsoid, a method for
                    identifying potential signals from advanced civilizations in
                    the cosmos. The SETI Ellipsoid is a strategic approach for
                    selecting potential technosignature candidates based on the
                    hypothesis that extraterrestrial civilizations, upon
                    observing significant galactic events such as supernova
                    1987A, might use these occurrences as a focal point to emit
                    synchronized signals to announce their presence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this work, researchers show that the SETI Ellipsoid
                    method can leverage continuous, wide-field sky surveys,
                    significantly enhancing our ability to detect these
                    potential signals. By compensating for the uncertainties in
                    the estimated time-of-arrival of such signals using
                    observations that span up to a year, the team implements the
                    SETI Ellipsoid strategy in an innovative way using
                    state-of-the-arc technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In examining data from the TESS continuous viewing
                    zone, covering 5% of all TESS data from the first three
                    years of its mission, researchers utilized the advanced 3D
                    location data from Gaia Early Data Release 3. This analysis
                    identified 32 prime targets within the SETI Ellipsoid in the
                    southern TESS continuous viewing zone, all with
                    uncertainties refined to better than 0.5 light-years. While
                    the initial examination of TESS light curves during the
                    Ellipsoid crossing event revealed no anomalies, the
                    groundwork laid by this initiative paves the way for
                    expanding the search to other surveys, a broader array of
                    targets, and exploring diverse potential signal types.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The SETI Ellipsoid method, combined with Gaia's
                    distance measurements, offers a robust and adaptable
                    framework for future SETI searches. Researchers can
                    retrospectively apply it to sift through archival data for
                    potential signals, proactively select targets, and schedule
                    future monitoring campaigns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "As Dr. Jill Tarter often points out, SETI searches are like
                    looking for a needle in a 9-D haystack," said co-author Dr.
                    Sofia Sheikh. "Any technique that can help us prioritize
                    where to look, such as the SETI Ellipsoid, could potentially
                    give us a shortcut to the most promising parts of the
                    haystack. This work is the first step in searching those
                    newly-highlighted parts of parameter space, and is an
                    exciting precedent for upcoming large survey projects like
                    LSST."

                    data from non-Facebook products, including Meta-owned
                    Instagram and other third-party sites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And sharing data with third parties had become "a condition
                    of accessing the Facebook platform, pursuant to a
                    'take-it-or-leave-it' offer".

                  <p>
                    [...] Meta said the "fundamental concerns identified by the
                    tribunal in its February 2023 judgement have not been
                    resolved".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was "committed to giving people meaningful control" of
                    the information they shared on its platforms and to "invest
                    heavily to create tools that allow them to do so."

                    The legal action is being funded by Innsworth, a company
                    backed by an investment management fund, which has also
                    funded mass legal actions against Mastercard, Ericsson and

                        Promotion of the Intel 8080 Microprocessor" [link],
                        April 26th 2007, Computer History Museum, Mountain View,
                        California. Introduction
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Around 1977, Intel released a floppy disc controller
                        (FDC) chip called the 8271. This controller isn't
                        particularly well known. It was mainly used in business
                        computers and storage solutions, but its one
                        breakthrough into the consumer space was with the BBC
                        Micro, a UK-centric computer released in 1981.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        There are very few easily discovered details about this
                        chip online, aside from the useful datasheet. This,
                        combined with increasing observations of strange
                        behavior, make the chip a bit of an enigma. My interest
                        in the chip was piqued when I accidentally triggered a
                        wild test mode that managed to corrupt one of my floppy
                        discs even though the write protect tab was present!

                    A single packet can exhaust the processing capacity of a
                    vulnerable DNS server, effectively disabling the machine, by
                    exploiting a 20-plus-year-old design flaw in the DNSSEC
                    specification.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That would make it trivial to take down a DNSSEC-validating
                    DNS resolver that has yet to be patched, upsetting all the
                    clients relying on that service and make it seem as though
                    websites and apps were offline.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The academics who found this flaw – associated with the
                    German National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity
                    (ATHENE) in Darmstadt – claimed DNS server software makers
                    briefed about the vulnerability described it as "the worst
                    attack on DNS ever discovered."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] The researchers said lone DNS packets exploiting
                    KeyTrap could stall public DNSSEC-validated DNS services,
                    such as those provided by Google and Cloudflare, by making
                    them do calculations that overtax server CPU cores.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This disruption of DNS could not only deny people's access
                    to content but could also interfere with other systems,
                    including spam defenses, cryptographic defenses (PKI), and
                    inter-domain routing security (RPKI), the researchers
                    assert.

                    "Exploitation of this attack would have severe consequences
                    for any application using the Internet including
                    unavailability of technologies such as web-browsing, e-mail,
                    and instant messaging," they claimed. "With KeyTrap, an
                    attacker could completely disable large parts of the

                    The inside of underwater pipes and enclosed nuclear
                    containers were inaccessible—until recently. Acoustics
                    researchers in Penn State's College of Engineering have
                    developed a way to convey energy and transmit communications
                    through metal walls using ultrasound.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They published their innovation, a pillar-based acoustic
                    metamaterial that operates at ultrasound frequency range, in
                    Physical Review Applied. The work could have implications
                    for research in space, according to the researchers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If you wanted to power a device, such as a temperature
                    sensor, inside a metal enclosure like a pipe, ultrasound
                    waves can carry that energy to the device," said Yun Jing,
                    professor of acoustics and biomedical engineering and
                    corresponding author on the paper. "But previously, the
                    waves could not pass through metal barriers that would block
                    sound, unless the transducers were in direct contact with
                    the barrier."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers created a pillar-based metamaterial: an
                    array of tiny, cylindrical pillars positioned on a metal
                    plate that work as resonators, which vibrate or oscillate to
                    create acoustic resonance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the metamaterial is situated between a transducer
                    transmitter and a receiver, it dramatically enhances the
                    ultrasonic power transmission rate through a metal barrier,
                    without requiring direct contact between transducers and the
                    barrier. Previously, faint ultrasound waves could pass
                    through metal, but they lacked sufficient energy to power a
                    sensor or pass messages through the metal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "With a narrow end and a wider end like a pillar, the
                    acoustic metamaterial is designed like an acoustic
                    resonator," said first author Jun Ji, who recently earned
                    his doctorate in acoustics from Penn State. "The shape of
                    the metamaterial allows for a wireless transmission and
                    reception of ultrasound through a metal barrier."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers tested the function of the metamaterial
                    sample in two experiments. In the first, they wirelessly
                    transmitted power through a metal plate with the
                    metamaterial using an ultrasonic transmitter and a receiver,
                    successfully powering an LED light on the other side. This
                    confirmed the metamaterial's ability to transmit power
                    through metal walls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a second test case, they transmitted an image of the
                    letters "PSU" through a metal plate with the metamaterial
                    using encoded ultrasonic signal, confirming that
                    communications are possible with the use of the metamaterial
                    strengthening the transmission of ultrasound waves through
                    metal barriers.

                    Like all organizations, non-profit and corporate boards can
                    fall prey to groupthink, silo effects, or short-term or
                    trendy thinking that ultimately work against the interests
                    of the entity they are entrusted to oversee. A large
                    scientific literature has explored factors affecting board
                    function, from disciplinary and sociodemographic diversity
                    to size and deliberation processes. A less explored factor
                    is how the internal network structure of the board can
                    affect its performance.

                    [...] Boards face challenges, and their problems are not
                    just a function of mis-directed objectives (such as an
                    overly narrow focus on quarterly earnings or fealty to some
                    ideological commitment) nor a function of the
                    self-perpetuating insularity that makes them ignore external
                    pressures or information. Rather, the way many boards
                    themselves are structured may make them less capable of
                    confronting the enduring reality of such stresses. Efforts
                    to make it difficult or impossible for outsiders to join
                    boards (such as happened at Yale a couple of years ago) will
                    only exacerbate such problems.

                    Network insights can provide the right kind of disruption

                    Enea tested this. Via MMS it was able to make the target
                    device perform a GET to an URL on a server it controlled.
                    This HTTP GET exposed the device's <em>UserAgent</em> and
                    <em>x-wap-profile</em> fields. The first identifies the OS
                    and device. The second points to a UAProf (User Agent
                    Profile) file that describes the capabilities of a mobile
                    handset. Enea concealed the process by changing the binary
                    SMS element to be a silent SMS through setting a TP-PID
                    value of 0x40. The result was that no MMS content appears on
                    the targeted device, and the targeted person sees anything
                    on their phone.

                    All of this describes a possible infection route (which is
                    what the NSO contract claims) rather than a specific device
                    exploitation. However, with the information obtained,
                    further attacks are simplified. "Both of these can be very
                    useful for malicious actors," says McDaid. "Attackers could
                    use this information to exploit specific vulnerabilities or
                    tailor malicious payloads (such as the

                    to help craft phishing campaigns against the human using the
                    device more effectively."

                    To a degree, this is all theory – but Enea has demonstrated
                    that it is a workable MMS fingerprinting method. The firm
                    has found no indication of it being used in the wild, but
                    notes that it doesn't have visibility into every operator in
                    the world. It can be blocked by the local mobile network,
                    while subscribers could disable MMS auto-retrieval on their
                    handset (as recommended to defend against other MMS exploits

                    recently published in a reputable journal. Those
                    figures—which the authors acknowledge in the article's text
                    were made by Midjourney—are all uninterpretable. They
                    contain gibberish text and, most strikingly, one includes an
                    image of a rat with grotesquely large and bizarre genitals,

                    The images, while egregious examples, highlight a growing
                    problem in scientific publishing. A scientist's success
                    relies heavily on their publication record, with a large
                    volume of publications, frequent publishing, and articles
                    appearing in top-tier journals, all of which earn scientists
                    more prestige. The system incentivizes less-than-scrupulous
                    researchers to push through low-quality articles, which, in
                    the era of AI chatbots, could potentially be generated with
                    the help of AI. Researchers worry that the growing use of AI
                    will make published research less trustworthy. As such,
                    research journals have recently set new authorship
                    guidelines for AI-generated text to try to address the
                    problem. But for now, as the Frontiers article shows, there
                    are clearly some gaps.

                It looks like "peer reviewed" is becoming meaningless nowadays.
                However, this attempt is so obviously fake that I cannot see how
                anyone could have put their name to having completed a review.

                that reveals some new information about the Indo-European
                proto-language:

                  <p>
                    Almost half of all people in the world today speak an
                    Indo-European language, one whose origins go back thousands
                    of years to a single mother tongue. Languages as different
                    as English, Russian, Hindustani, Latin, and Sanskrit can all
                    be traced back to this ancestral language.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the last couple of hundred years, linguists have
                    figured out a lot about that first Indo-European language,
                    including many of the words it used and some of the
                    grammatical rules that governed it. Along the way, they've
                    come up with theories about who its original speakers were,
                    where and how they lived, and how their language spread so
                    widely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most linguists think that those speakers were nomadic
                    herders who lived on the steppes of Ukraine and western
                    Russia about 6,000 years ago. Yet a minority put the origin
                    2,000 to 3,000 years before that, with a community of
                    farmers in Anatolia, in the area of modern-day Turkey. Now a
                    new analysis, using techniques borrowed from evolutionary
                    biology, has come down in favor of the latter, albeit with
                    an important later role for the steppes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The computational technique used in the new analysis is
                    hotly disputed among linguists. But its proponents say it
                    promises to bring more quantitative rigor to the field, and
                    could possibly push key dates further into the past, much as
                    radiocarbon dating did in the field of archaeology.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To tackle the problem, Kyoto researchers set up a project to
                    evaluate types of wood to determine how well they could
                    withstand the rigours of space launch and lengthy flights in
                    orbit round the Earth. The first tests were carried out in
                    laboratories that recreated conditions in space, and wood
                    samples were found to have suffered no measurable changes in
                    mass or signs of decomposition or damage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Wood's ability to withstand these conditions astounded us,"
                    said Koji Murata, head of the project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After these tests, samples were sent to the ISS, where they
                    were subjected to exposure trials for almost a year before
                    being brought back to Earth. Again they showed little signs
                    of damage, a phenomenon that Murata attributed to the fact
                    that there is no oxygen in space which could cause wood to
                    burn, and no living creatures to cause it to rot.

                    The Canary Islands—More than 1000 years ago, a young man
                    stood on the northern shore of the island now known as El
                    Hierro. Across the wave-swept Atlantic Ocean, he could see
                    the silhouettes of other islands, a volcanic peak on one
                    soaring toward the clouds only 90 kilometers away. Yet, for
                    him, those islands were as unreachable as the Moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    His body betrayed the rigors of life on his arid volcanic
                    outcrop. His molars were worn almost to the gums from
                    grinding fibrous wild fern roots. His ancestors here had
                    farmed wheat, but he and his contemporaries grew only barley
                    and raised livestock such as goats. His genes held evidence
                    that his parents were closely related, like many of the
                    roughly 1000 people on the island, who had not mingled with
                    outsiders for centuries. Also like many of his fellow
                    islanders, he bore signs of an old head injury, likely
                    sustained in a fight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This population faced a lot of challenges," says
                    archaeologist Jonathan Santana of the University of Las
                    Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC). "Survival on this island was
                    a challenge every day."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yet the first Canarians, who arrived from North Africa
                    roughly 1800 years ago, survived and even thrived on this
                    arid, windswept archipelago for 1000 years. They numbered in
                    the tens of thousands when Europeans arrived at the start of
                    the 14th century. Not long after, conquest and genocide had
                    largely erased them as a people. But their DNA lives on in
                    many islanders today, and traces of their lives remain, in
                    granaries, cliff dwellings, ceramic figurines, and hundreds
                    of human remains like those of the man on El Hierro—all
                    remarkably well preserved by the dry climate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By applying the latest archaeological tools to this trove of
                    material, Santana and other home-grown archaeologists are
                    unearthing their stories, shedding light on puzzles that
                    have mystified archaeologists since the 19th century. For
                    instance, how did people with no apparent seafaring skills
                    reach and survive on the archipelago? Why did their crops
                    and cultures differ from island to island despite their
                    common origin? The answers offer insights into how human
                    societies cope with—and respond to—challenging environments,
                    says Scott Fitzpatrick, a University of Oregon archaeologist
                    who studies island cultures. "The Canaries have been sort of
                    an enigma."

                    seriously. Seventy-three percent of business leaders
                    surveyed, for example, agreed that responsible technology
                    use will come to be as important as business and financial
                    considerations when making technology decisions.

                    This AI moment, however, may represent a unique opportunity
                    to overcome barriers that have previously stalled
                    responsible technology work. Lack of senior management
                    awareness (cited by 52% of those surveyed as a top barrier
                    to adopting responsible practices) is certainly less of a
                    concern today: savvy executives are quickly becoming fluent
                    in this new technology and are continually reminded of its
                    potential consequences, failures, and societal harms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The other top barriers cited were organizational resistance
                    to change (46%) and internal competing priorities (46%).
                    Organizations that have realigned themselves behind a clear
                    AI strategy, and who understand its industry-altering
                    potential, may be able to overcome this inertia and
                    indecision as well. At this singular moment of disruption,
                    when AI provides both the tools and motivation to redesign
                    many of the ways in which we work and live, we can fold
                    responsible technology principles into that transition—if we
                    choose to.

                    Dounin technically stopped working for F5 at that point,
                    too, but maintained his role in Nginx "as a volunteer,"
                    according to Dounin's mailing list post.

                  <p>
                    Dounin writes in his announcement that "new non-technical
                    management" at F5 "recently decided that they know better
                    how to run open source projects. In particular, they decided
                    to interfere with security policy nginx uses for years,
                    ignoring both the policy and developers' position." While it
                    was "quite understandable," given their ownership, Dounin
                    wrote that it means he was "no longer able to control which
                    changes are made in nginx," hence his departure and fork.

                  <p>
                    As the last reindeer herds disappeared from our latitudes
                    around 11,000 years ago, when the climate became warmer and
                    forests were spreading, the stone wall was most likely not
                    built after this time. This would make it the oldest human
                    structure ever discovered in the Baltic Sea.<br />Originally,
                    a team of researchers and students from Kiel University
                    (CAU) wanted to investigate manganese crusts on a ridge of
                    basal till that forms the seafloor about 10 kilometers off
                    Rerik in Mecklenburg Bight. During their survey, however,
                    they discovered a 970-meter long regular row of stones.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The structure consists of around 1,500 stones, most some
                    tens of centimeters in diameter, that connect several large
                    meter-scale boulders. The researchers reported their
                    discovery to the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state agency for
                    culture and monument preservation (Landesamt für Kultur und
                    Denkmalpflege Mecklenburg-Vorpommern LAKD M-V), which then
                    coordinated further investigations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The stone wall is located on the southwestern flank of a
                    ridge of basal till trending roughly parallel to an adjacent
                    basin in the South, presumably a former lake or bog. Today,
                    the Baltic Sea is 21 meters deep at this location. Thus, the
                    stone wall must have been built before the sea level rose
                    significantly after the end of the last ice age, which
                    happened around 8,500 years ago. Large parts of the
                    previously accessible landscape ultimately flooded at that
                    time.

                    misled by an airline chatbot inaccurately explaining the
                    airline's bereavement travel policy.

                    travel policy, Moffatt should have known bereavement rates
                    could not be requested retroactively. Instead of a refund,
                    the best Air Canada would do was to promise to update the
                    chatbot and offer Moffatt a $200 coupon to use on a future
                    flight.

                    the chatbot's misleading information because Air Canada
                    essentially argued that "the chatbot is a separate legal

                    24. While Mr. Moffatt does not use the words specifically,
                    by saying they relied on Air Canada's chatbot, I find they
                    are alleging negligent misrepresentation. Negligent
                    misrepresentation can arise when a seller does not exercise
                    reasonable care to ensure its representations are accurate
                    and not misleading.

                  <p>
                    25. To prove the tort of negligent misrepresentation, Mr.
                    Moffatt must show that Air Canada owed them a duty of care,
                    its representation was untrue, inaccurate, or misleading,
                    Air Canada made the representation negligently, Mr. Moffatt
                    reasonably relied on it, and Mr. Moffatt's reliance resulted
                    in damages.

                Should a company be held to the hallucinations of their AI
                chatbot? This could slow the adoption of AI chatbots that are
                not ready for actual public interaction. It could delay
                executives the ability to save money in this quarter.

                    this wasn't the only change to the service. Those who don't
                    pay up also lose features; their accounts no longer support

                    A US PRIVATE Moon lander has successfully launched 24 hours
                    after its flight was delayed due to fuel issues. The Nova-C
                    Odysseus lander, built by Texas-based space flight company
                    Intuitive Machines (IM), could become the first private
                    mission – called IM-1 – to land intact on the lunar surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Moon lander had lift-off at 6.05am Irish time this
                    morning atop SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral in
                    Florida, SpaceX posted on X (formerly Twitter).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It comes a month after another US spacecraft, Peregrine,
                    failed to touch down following a fuel leak. The failure of
                    Peregrine, operated by US company Astrobotic, marked the
                    third time a private company had been unable to achieve a
                    soft landing on the lunar surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Beresheet lander, built by Israel's SpaceIL, crashed
                    during descent in 2019, while the Hakuto-R M1 lander, from
                    Japanese company ispace, was destroyed while attempting to
                    land in April last year.

                    Odysseus would be the first US Moon landing since the final
                    mission of the Apollo programme – Apollo 17 – more than 50
                    years ago. Odysseus is a hexagonal cylinder about 13ft (4m)
                    tall and 5ft (1.57m) wide and weighs 1,488lb (675kg).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is part of Nasa's Commercial Lunar Payload Services
                    initiative, which aims to involve commercial companies in
                    the exploration of the Moon as the space agency focuses on
                    getting astronauts back there through its Artemis programme.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If all goes to plan, Odysseus could attempt a lunar landing
                    on February 22. The landing site will be at Malapert A, a
                    crater near the Moon's south pole. Once it is on the
                    surface, Odysseus will operate for roughly two weeks, or one
                    lunar day.

                    including Canada, and was informed and supported by [the
                    Society of Automotive Engineers]," Audi, VW's luxury brand,
                    wrote in a statement provided to CNN. "Many of our cars
                    equipped with matrix design or digital matrix design
                    lighting on US roads today could be turned on to provide
                    greater visibility and less glare which means safer roads

                  <p>
                    NHTSA's rules require the ADB headlights to respond
                    extremely swiftly after detecting another vehicle within
                    reach of the lights, much faster than other standards
                    require in the EU and Canada. Also much faster than a human
                    could switch off an ordinary high beam headlight. They also
                    dictate extreme narrow lines between bright and dark
                    regions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, the NHTSA regulations require completely new
                    headlamp designs for the US, Larsen said. This means the ADB
                    capabilities engineered into headlights already on Audi and
                    Mercedes cars in the US, for instance, will probably never
                    get switched on.

                    which have been downloaded more than 100 million times on

                    trackers that send information to Google, Facebook, and
                    companies in Russia and China; allow users to use weak
                    passwords; and lack transparency about their ownership and

                    Since OpenAI unleashed ChatGPT on the world in November
                    2022, developers have raced to deploy large language models
                    and create chatbots that people can interact with and pay to
                    subscribe to. The Mozilla research provides a glimpse into
                    how this gold rush may have neglected people's privacy, and
                    into tensions between emerging technologies and how they
                    gather and use data. It also indicates how people's chat
                    messages could be abused by hackers.

                    The US government today confirmed China's Volt Typhoon crew
                    comprised "multiple" critical infrastructure orgs' IT
                    networks in America – and Uncle Sam warned that the
                    Beijing-backed spies are readying "disruptive or destructive
                    cyberattacks" against those targets.

                  <p>
                    The Chinese team remotely broke into IT environments —
                    primarily across communications, energy, transportation
                    systems, and water and wastewater system sectors — in the
                    continental and non-continental United States and its

                    "Volt Typhoon's choice of targets and pattern of behavior is
                    not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or
                    intelligence gathering operations, and the US authoring
                    agencies assess with high confidence that Volt Typhoon
                    actors are pre-positioning themselves on IT networks to

                    [...] While the threat to American critical infrastructure
                    appears to be the highest, should US facilities be
                    disrupted, "Canada would likely be affected as well, due to
                    cross-border integration," according to CCCS.

                  <p>
                    Australian and New Zealand critical infrastructure could be
                    vulnerable as well.

                  <p>
                    In addition to sounding the alarm, the government bodies
                    issued a long list of technical details, TTPs observed in
                    the digital break-ins, and detection recommendations and
                    best practices.

                  <p>
                    Plus, there's three actions that owners and operators should
                    take "today" to mitigate the threat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These include: Apply patches for internet-facing systems
                    with priority given to appliances that Volt Typhoon likes to
                    exploit. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second: Turn on phishing-resistant multi-factor
                    authentication (MFA).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And finally, ensure that logging is turned on for
                    applications, access and security logs, and store these logs
                    in a centralized system.

                    The conceptual demonstration in these optoelectronic
                    metasurfaces have a number of promising applications. The
                    generated charge current can be naturally utilized as the
                    signal for photodetection, particularly important at long
                    wavelength infrared region. The system can serve as a source
                    of terahertz radiation, useful in a range of applications
                    from ultra-high-speed wireless communications to
                    spectroscopy characterization of materials. The system could
                    also offer new opportunities for controlling nanomagnetism,
                    in which the specialized currents may be designed for
                    adaptable, nano-scale magnetic fields.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new capability may also prove important for ultrafast
                    information processing, including computation and
                    microelectronics. The ability to use the laser pulses and
                    metasurfaces for adaptive circuits could allow for the
                    dispatching of slower and less versatile transistor-based
                    computer and electronics architectures. Unlike conventional
                    circuits, adaptive structured light fields could offer
                    completely new design possibilities.

                    What explains the popularity of terminals with 80×24 and
                    80×25 displays? A recent blog post "80x25" motivated me to
                    investigate this. The source of 80-column lines is clearly
                    punch cards, as commonly claimed. But why 24 or 25 lines?
                    There are many theories, but I found a simple answer: IBM,
                    in particular its dominance of the terminal market. In 1971,
                    IBM introduced a terminal with an 80×24 display (the 3270)
                    and it soon became the best-selling terminal, forcing
                    competing terminals to match its 80×24 size. The display for
                    the IBM PC added one more line to its screen, making the
                    80×25 size standard in the PC world. The impact of these
                    systems remains decades later: 80-character lines are still
                    a standard, along with both 80×24 and 80×25 terminal
                    windows.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this blog post, I'll discuss this history in detail,
                    including some other systems that played key roles. The CRT
                    terminal market essentially started with the IBM 2260
                    Display Station in 1965, built from curious technologies
                    such as sonic delay lines. This led to the popular IBM 3270
                    display and then widespread, inexpensive terminals such as
                    the DEC VT100. In 1981, IBM released a microcomputer called
                    the DataMaster. While the DataMaster is mostly forgotten, it
                    strongly influenced the IBM PC, including the display. This
                    post also studies reports on the terminal market from the
                    1970s and 1980s; these make it clear that market forces, not
                    technological forces, led to the popularity of various
                    display sizes.

                Alexey Navalny, Russia's most famous dissident, has died. (4
                June 1976 – 16 February 2024).
              </p>
              <p>
                Returning to Russia in 2021, after having been treated in Berlin
                for novichok poisoning, Navalny was immediately arrested on
                arrival at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. Since then, he has
                been in and out of (but mostly in) solitary confinement all over
                the country, with his final station being the
                <i>Polar Wolf</i> penal colony in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous
                Okrug, Siberia.

                    CNM-Au8 is a concentrated suspension of gold nanocrystals
                    whose surfaces catalyze the rapid oxidation of NADH to NAD+,
                    shown to increase the availability of both NAD<sup>+</sup>
                    and ATP in <em>in vitro</em> studies. It's also known to
                    cross the blood-brain barrier and penetrate cell membranes.
                    [...] All participants received 120 ml of CNM-Au8, which
                    they drank each morning for 12 weeks. Beginning with the
                    baseline visit, participants had ECG, blood tests, physical
                    exams, and scoring of either motor and non-motor Parkinson's
                    symptoms or the degree of disability caused by MS.
                    Phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-MRS) was used
                    to noninvasively assess energy metabolites of the whole
                    brain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] After 12 weeks of treatment with CNM-Au8, the mean
                    change in NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio from baseline across
                    both cohorts demonstrated a statistically significant
                    increase by an average of 10.4%, demonstrating that the gold
                    nanocrystals were targeting the brain as intended. The
                    effect on the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio ceased after the
                    12-week CNM-Au9 treatment was concluded. The researchers
                    also observed an inverse correlation between the baseline
                    and post-treatment levels of ATP and other brain energy
                    metabolites; participants with relatively lower baseline
                    levels demonstrated increases, and participants with
                    relatively higher baseline levels demonstrated a

                    significant improvement at week four. This score reflects

                    most valuable company in the US, behind Microsoft, Apple,

                    Nvidia first overtook Amazon, it held a stock value of

                    As of this writing, the two companies are still close in

                    Over the past year, I have published a series of CACM blogs
                    in which I analyzed the introduction of generative AI, in

                    One of the messages of these blogs was that computer science
                    high school teachers and computer science freshmen clearly
                    see the potential contribution of ChatGPT to computer
                    science teaching and learning processes and highlight the
                    opportunities it opens for computer science education, over
                    the potential threats it poses. Another message was that
                    generative AI, and specifically LLM-based conversational
                    agents (e.g., ChatGPT), may turn out to be disruptive
                    technologies for computer science education and, therefore,
                    should be conceived of as an opportunity for computer
                    science education to stay relevant.

                    In this blog, we address high school teachers' perspective
                    on the incorporation of ChatGPT into computer science
                    education. [...]

                    With respect to the adoption of generative AI, it seems that
                    the chasm in its adoption process has already been crossed
                    and that, due to the simplicity of using the various
                    generative AI applications available, a huge population,
                    either with or without a technological background, has
                    already adopted them.

                    Based on the SWOT analysis presented above, the meaningful

                    linking to the WorldCat records. Among other claims, the
                    defendants stand accused of breach of contract, unjust
                    enrichment, tortious interference of contract and business
                    relationships, trespass to chattels, and conversion of
                    property.

                  <p>
                    As compensation for OCLC's reported injuries, the company
                    seeks damages, including compensatory, exemplary, and
                    punitive damages. At the time of writing, the defendants
                    have yet to respond to the allegations.

                    I watch a ton of YouTube, on the order of an hour or two
                    each day and I can honestly say the no-ads premium family
                    account on YouTube is one of the best bargains on the
                    internet for everyone in my house.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lately, YouTube creators are going through a reckoning, and
                    I think it's unfortunate to see some creators I've come to
                    know and trust over the years squander their work as they
                    chase percentage points of revenue instead of focusing on
                    the craft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It reminds me a lot of how blogging changed around
                    2005-2009, when ad money came pouring in, and while it was
                    great for bloggers that previously were just publishing for
                    the heck of it (myself included), eventually the money
                    tainted the process as many people rushed to improve their
                    bottom line, often at the expense of whole reason they
                    created their sites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] My hope for YouTube creators is much like bloggers.
                    Don't spend all your time chasing the tea leaves and
                    conventional wisdom. Focus on your channel/site and keep
                    creating things you love that will resonate with your
                    viewers/readers. Hopefully the money will follow, but
                    obsessing over how to eke out every last cent from your work
                    will make your work suffer.

                    by disrupting levels of zinc in our inner ears, a study in
                    mice suggests. Therapies that mitigate this could be used to
                    treat or even prevent such damage, for example if taken
                    before a rock concert.

                    [...] Most of the body's zinc is attached to proteins, but
                    the rest works as a communication signal between organs,
                    especially the brain, says Tzounopoulos. The highest
                    concentration of free zinc in the body is in the cochlea,
                    the snail-shaped structure in the inner ear that converts
                    vibrations into electrical signals, which are then
                    interpreted as

                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers found that these mice had greater
                    amounts of free zinc in between and around the cells in
                    their cochlea after the sound blast compared with before, as
                    well as in comparison to a group of control mice that hadn't
                    heard the loud sounds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There is a very robust upregulation of zinc, in terms of
                    quantity, but also in terms of spatial covering of the
                    area," he says. "It goes everywhere."

                  <p>
                    With further research, zinc-trapping pills, drops or
                    slow-release implants might one day help prevent or treat
                    inner ear damage from noise trauma, says Tzounopoulos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "You could go to a concert or to combat and you could take a
                    pill," he says. "Or you might have an accident, and they
                    could have these compounds in the ER [emergency room] to
                    give you to help mitigate the damage."

                    against keyless ignition and entry systems. This form of
                    hack works by holding one device near a key fob and a second
                    device near the vehicle the fob works with. In the most
                    typical scenario, the fob is located on a shelf near a
                    locked front door, and the car is several dozen feet away in
                    a driveway. By placing one device near the front door and
                    another one next to the car, the hack beams the radio
                    signals necessary to unlock and start the device.

                    This attack requires a high-power transceiver that's not
                    capable with the Flipper Zero. These attacks are carried out
                    using pricy off-the-shelf equipment and modifying it using a
                    fair amount of expertise in radio frequency
                    communications.<br />[...]<br />"You can't perform a rolljam
                    attack with a single Flipper Zero, and you sure as hell
                    can't use a 64 MHz, 32-bit ARM processor to crack rolling
                    codes," Rob Stumpf, a journalist who covers the intersection
                    of cars and cybersecurity. At most, he said, a Flipper Zero
                    can perform limited attacks on select modern cars, mostly
                    from Honda and Acura, that can unlock and start a vehicle.
                    These sorts of attacks, however, require the thief to be
                    within close proximity of the owner while actively unlocking
                    the car.

                    >.<br />[...]<br />"The more common relay attacks used in
                    vehicle thefts are from sophisticated purpose-built tools,"
                    Stumpf said. "Those devices are the real threat—not some kid
                    opening a Tesla charging port with their Flipper Zero."<br />[...]<br />It's
                    not the first time the hobbyist device has been portrayed as
                    a tool for sophisticated crime. That impression is likely
                    the result of a

                    on YouTube and TikTok showing the device used to empty ATMs

                    faked, likely by people attempting to drive sales to
                    websites impersonating Flipper Zero vendors. Several months
                    after the appearance of those videos, Amazon stopped selling
                    the product, which it labeled as a "<a

                    Kulagin said that governments in jurisdictions other than
                    Canada have been much more open-minded about the Flipper
                    Zero. One such body was the New Jersey Cybersecurity &amp;
                    Communications Integration Cell, which contacted the device
                    maker directly following the rash of misleading videos.

                    For almost seven years, Cloudflare has been fighting against
                    patent trolls. We've been doing this successfully through
                    the efforts of our own legal team, external counsel, and the
                    extraordinary efforts of people on the Internet looking for
                    prior art (and getting rewarded for it) through our Project
                    Jengo.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While we refuse to pay trolls for their meritless claims,
                    we've been happy to award prizes to Project Jengo
                    participants who help stop the trolls through prior art that
                    invalidates their patents or claims. Project Jengo
                    participants helped us in the past roundly beat the patent
                    troll Blackbird (who subsequently went out of business).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The jury found that Cloudflare did not infringe the
                    patent asserted against Cloudflare by patent trolls Sable IP
                    and Sable Networks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And while that would have been enough to decide the case by
                    itself, the jury went further and found that Sable's old and
                    broadly-written patent claim was invalid and never should
                    have been granted in the first place–meaning they can no
                    longer assert the claim against anyone else. Since Sable
                    first sued us, we've invalidated significant parts of three
                    Sable patents, hamstringing their ability to bring lawsuits
                    against other companies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's worth noting that very few lawsuits ever reach a jury.
                    Most non-lawyers are shocked to learn that only about 1% of
                    civil cases make it to trial, because trials are generally
                    what they see on TV or in film. But professional litigators
                    know that almost all cases are resolved much earlier through
                    procedures that are much less entertaining to watch on
                    screen: written motions, delay, or settlement. A big reason
                    for this is that taking a case to trial–even on simple
                    matters–is extremely costly. In patent cases, that means
                    millions of dollars.

                        rust marks in the rain and that required the vehicle to

                    An Oregon resident contracted bubonic plague from their
                    "very sick" pet cat, marking the first time since 2015 that
                    someone in the state has been stricken with the Black Death
                    bacterium,

                    Plague bacteria, Yersinia pestis, circulates cryptically in
                    the US in various types of rodents and their fleas. It
                    causes an average of seven human cases a year, with a range
                    of 1 to 17, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
                    Prevention. The cases tend to cluster in two regions, the
                    CDC notes: a hotspot that spans northern New Mexico,
                    northern Arizona, and southern Colorado, and another region
                    spanning California, far western Nevada, and southern
                    Oregon.

                    The new case in Oregon occurred in the central county of
                    Deschutes. It was fortunately caught early before the
                    infection developed into a more severe, systemic bloodstream
                    infection (septicemic plague).

                    [...] It's unclear how or why the cat became infected. But
                    cats are particularly susceptible to plague and are
                    considered a common source of infection in the US. The
                    animals, when left to roam outdoors, can pick up infections
                    from fleas as well as killing and eating infected rodents.
                    Though dogs can also pick up the infection from fleas or
                    other animals, they are

                    First, the Ovrdrive USB design functions pretty simply. It's
                    mostly a run-of-the-mill USB flash drive with a unique
                    activation mechanism. For it to be detected by your machine,
                    you have to rapidly insert the drive three consecutive times
                    actually to turn it on. Failure to do so will hide the
                    drive's partition and give the impression that it's broken.
                    Initially, it was supposed to self-destruct, but it proved
                    too challenging to mass produce, forcing Walker to change
                    the drive.

                    priced at $69 with free US domestic shipping or $12
                    international shipping for the rest of the world. At the
                    original time of writing, the flash drive has reached 70% of
                    its funding, with two days remaining on the funding
                    deadline.

                      >new 2024 edition</a

                    release of this compact Linux OS was more than a decade ago.
                    Over the years DSL has put on weight (haven't we all)
                    inflating from 50MB in 2008 to today's 700MB. That sounds
                    like a lot, but the philosophy of making a usable desktop
                    distribution for older PCs with limited hardware resources
                    is similar. Moreover "applications, the kernel, and drivers
                    have all mushroomed," explains John Andrews, the driving
                    force behind this project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Originally, DSL was launched as a

                    live CD Linux distribution based on Debian and Knoppix. The
                    relaunched version [is] a Debian and antiX distribution,
                    will still run from a live CD, but it needs a full-sized CD.
                    Andrews asserts that 700MB is a new hard limit for DSL going
                    forward, and it needs to be for standard CDR compatibility.

                    It turns out some of the informed speculation about the US
                    military's latest X-37B spaceplane mission was pretty much
                    spot-on.

                    When the semi-classified winged spacecraft launched on
                    December 28, it flew into orbit on top of a SpaceX Falcon
                    Heavy rocket, which is much larger than the Atlas V and
                    Falcon 9 rockets used to launch the X-37B on its previous
                    missions. [...] This immediately sparked speculation that
                    the X-37B would reach higher altitudes than its past
                    flights, which remained in low-Earth orbit at altitudes of a
                    few hundred miles. A discovery from Tomi Simola, a satellite
                    tracking hobbyist living near Helsinki, Finland, appears to
                    confirm this suspicion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Friday, Simola reported on social media and on SeeSat-L,
                    a long-running online forum of satellite tracking
                    enthusiasts, that he detected an unidentified object using a
                    sky-watching camera. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Exciting news!" Simola posted on social media. "Orbital
                    Test Vehicle 7 (OTV-7), which was launched to classified
                    orbit last December, was seen by my SatCam! Here are images

                    George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue was premiered one hundred
                    years ago today, on the snowy afternoon of February 12,
                    1924, at Aeolian Hall on Manhattan's West 43rd Street.

                    The 25-year-old composer was at the piano, joined by the
                    dance band of Paul Whiteman, the noted bandleader who
                    commissioned the work. It was presented near the end of a
                    marathon concert, organized and promoted by Whiteman,
                    entitled, An Experiment in Modern Music. Purportedly in
                    attendance were such musical luminaries as Sergei
                    Rachmaninov, Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz, Leopold
                    Stokowski, Ernest Bloch, Igor Stravinsky, Walter Damrosch,
                    Victor Herbert, and John Philip Sousa. Whiteman later
                    recalled that

                        concert managers came to have a look at the novelty, Tin
                        Pan Alleyites, composers, symphony and opera stars,
                        flappers, cake-eaters, all mixed up higgledy-piggledy.

                    A German court has sided with R2 Semiconductor against
                    Intel, ruling that the chip giant infringed one of R2's
                    patent. This decision could lead to sales ban of select
                    Intel processors as well as products based on them in
                    Germany. Intel, for its part, has accused R2 of being a
                    patent troll wielding a low-quality patent, and has said
                    that it will appeal the decision.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The regional court in Düsseldorf, Germany, ruled that Intel
                    infringed a patent covering an integrated voltage regulator
                    technology that belongs to Palo Alto, California-based R2
                    Semiconductor. The court on Wednesday issued an injunction
                    against sales of Intel's Core-series 'Ice Lake,' 'Tiger
                    Lake,' 'Alder Lake,' and Xeon Scalable 'Ice Lake Server'
                    processors as well as PCs and servers based on these CPUs.
                    Some of these processors have already been discontinued, but
                    there are Alder Lake chips are available in retail and
                    inside many systems that are still on the shelves. Though
                    the ruling does not mean that these CPUs will disappear from
                    the German market immediately.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, the injunction does not cover Intel's
                    current-generation Core 'Raptor Lake' and Core Ultra 'Meteor
                    Lake' processors for desktops and laptops, according to
                    <a

                      >The Financial Times</a
                    >, so the impact of the injunction is set to be fairly
                    limited.

                  <p>
                    Intel has expressed its disappointment with the verdict and
                    announced its intention to challenge the decision. The
                    company criticized R2 Semiconductor's litigation strategy,
                    accusing it of pursuing serial lawsuits against big
                    companies, particularly after Intel managed to invalidate
                    one of R2's U.S. patents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "R2 files serial lawsuits to extract large sums from
                    innovators like Intel," a statement by Intel reads. "R2
                    first filed suit against Intel in the U.S., but after Intel
                    invalidated R2's low-quality U.S. patent R2 shifted its
                    campaign against Intel to Europe. Intel believes companies
                    like R2, which appears to be a shell company whose only
                    business is litigation, should not be allowed to obtain
                    injunctions on CPUs and other critical components at the
                    expense of consumers, workers, national security, and the
                    economy."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In its lawsuit against Intel, R2 requested the court to halt
                    sales of infringing processors, sales of products equipped
                    with these CPUs, and to mandate a recall of items containing
                    these processors, as

                      >Intel revealed last September</a
                    >. The company contended that imposing an injunction would
                    be an excessive response.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, it is important to note that in this legal battle
                    Intel is safeguarding its customers by assuming
                    responsibility for any legal expenses or compensations they
                    may incur. Consequently, as of September, Intel was unable
                    to provide a reliable estimate of the possible financial
                    impact or the scope of potential losses that could result
                    from the legal battle as they can be vast.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a stark contrast with Intel, R2 welcomes the court's
                    decisions and presents the company's own view on the legal
                    dispute.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are delighted that the highly respected German court has
                    issued an injunction and unequivocally found that Intel has
                    infringed R2's patents for integrated voltage regulators,"
                    said David Fisher, CEO of R2. "We intend to enforce this
                    injunction and protect our valuable intellectual property.
                    The global patent system is here precisely for the purpose
                    of protecting inventors like myself and R2 Semiconductor."

                    Researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical
                    Campus have discovered that odors stimulate specific brain
                    cells that may play a role in rapid "go/no-go"
                    decision-making.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The scientists focused on the hippocampus, an area of the
                    brain crucial to memory and learning. They knew that
                    so-called "time cells" played a major role in hippocampal
                    function, but didn't know their role in associative
                    learning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These are cells that would remind you to make a decision—do
                    this or do that," said the study's senior author Diego
                    Restrepo, Ph.D., a neuroscientist and professor of cell and
                    developmental biology at the University of Colorado School
                    of Medicine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers observed that when mice were given the
                    choice of responding to a fruity smell by licking on a spout
                    that delivered sweet water, they quickly learned to lick the
                    fruity smell as opposed to the smell of mineral oil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "They have to associate the odor with the outcome of what
                    they are doing so that's why they learn decision-making,"
                    said Ming Ma, Ph.D., a first author of the study and a
                    senior instructor in cell and developmental biology at the
                    CU School of Medicine. "When it's a fruit odor, they lick
                    and get a reward. When it's mineral oil, they stop licking."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The more they learned, the more the cells were stimulated,
                    leading to more rapid decoding of the odors and allowing the
                    mice to quickly become proficient at choosing the fruity
                    smell," said Fabio Simoes de Souza, DSc, another first
                    author of the study and an assistant research professor in
                    cell and developmental biology at the CU School of Medicine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The catalyst for the decision-making is the odor that
                    travels up the nose, sending neural signals to the olfactory
                    bulb and to the hippocampus. The two organs are closely
                    connected. The information is swiftly processed and the
                    brain makes a decision based on the input.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Before this we didn't know there were decision-making cells
                    in the hippocampus," Restrepo said. "The hippocampus is
                    multitasking."

                    Brauer’s team analyzed data from 269,725 older male
                    residents (average age 59) who were newly diagnosed with
                    erectile dysfunction and either given a prescription for a
                    PDE5I or not. They then tracked the outcomes of these two
                    groups for five years on average.

                    By the end of the study period, 1,119 people overall had
                    been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. But those taking a
                    PDE5I were significantly less likely to have Alzheimer’s
                    than those who didn’t—about 18% less likely after adjusting
                    for other potentially important factors. This reduced risk
                    was only clearly seen with sildenafil and not other PDE5Is,
                    but the discrepancy might be due to there being fewer users
                    of these drugs and not any biological difference, Brauer
                    said.

                    Wednesday in the journal Neurology, suggest a more modest
                    boon from these drugs than the 2021 study. But Brauer’s team
                    was somewhat surprised they found any buffer at all, given
                    that they used a similar method as the 2022 study. The
                    different results might be explained by the longer follow-up
                    data her team had on hand, she said, and she certainly
                    thinks that the research could point to something real.

                    [...] There are still important questions left to be
                    answered about this link, including exactly how these drugs
                    might work to prevent or delay Alzheimer’s. Since they’re
                    known to relax blood vessels, they could be improving blood
                    flow in the brain enough to have a neuroprotective effect,
                    Brauer said. Based on animal data, they might also be
                    indirectly boosting levels of acetylcholine, a
                    neurotransmitter important to cognition that steadily
                    becomes depleted in those with Alzheimer’s (many Alzheimer’s
                    drugs help manage symptoms by slowing this decline, but they
                    can’t stop it).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Importantly, neither Brauer’s study nor any other to date
                    provides conclusive evidence that PDE5Is can stop
                    Alzheimer’s. But given the urgent need for medicines that
                    can prevent or even just slow down the devastating
                    condition, the authors say these drugs deserve a closer and
                    extensive look from other researchers.
