                    The Russian government today handed down a treason
                    conviction and 14-year prison sentence on
                    <strong>Iyla Sachkov</strong>, the former founder and CEO of
                    one of Russia's largest cybersecurity firms. Sachkov, 37,
                    has been detained for nearly two years under charges that
                    the Kremlin has kept classified and hidden from public view,
                    and he joins a growing roster of former Russian cybercrime
                    fighters who are now serving hard time for farcical treason
                    convictions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2003, Sachkov founded <strong>Group-IB</strong>, a
                    cybersecurity and digital forensics company that quickly
                    earned a reputation for exposing and disrupting large-scale
                    cybercrime operations, including quite a few that were based
                    in Russia and stealing from Russian companies and citizens.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In September 2021, the Kremlin issued treason charges
                    against Sachkov, although it has refused to disclose any
                    details about the allegations. Sachkov pleaded not guilty.
                    After a three-week "trial" that was closed to the public,
                    Sachkov was convicted of treason and

              <p>
                Stanford University President, Dr. Marc Tessier-Lavigne, has
                <a href="https://archive.is/fZlYt"
                  >resigned after a university investigation</a
                >
                found that he had fostered an environment that led to "unusual
                frequency of manipulation of research data and/or substandard
                scientific practices" across labs at multiple institutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The review focused on five major papers for which he was listed
                as a principal author, finding evidence of manipulation of
                research data in four of them and a lack of scientific rigor in
                the fifth, a famous study that he said would "turn our current
                understanding of Alzheimer's on its head."
              </p>
              <p>
                The Stanford investigation did not find that Dr. Tessier-Lavigne
                personally altered data or pasted pieces of experimental images
                together. Instead, it found that he had presided over a lab
                culture that "tended to reward the 'winners' (that is, postdocs
                who could generate favorable results) and marginalize or
                diminish the 'losers' (that is, postdocs who were unable or
                struggled to generate such data)."
              </p>
              <p>
                A cynical Soylentil might see Dr. Tessier-Lavigne in much the
                same way as Al Capone who was only found guilty of tax evasion.
                Who benefited from falsification "across labs at multiple
                institutions"? It's well past time to put the scientists back in
                science and rethink the funding system that rewards the
                bullshitters.

                    government and industrial conglomerates, plans to start
                    high-volume production of chips on its 2nm fabrication
                    process in 2027. In a bid to ensure that all of its
                    production capacity is used, Rapidus wants to land orders
                    from at least one global company, essentially competing with

                    [...] In a bid to recoup production node R&amp;D costs and
                    fab costs, one needs to produce a boatload of chips on a
                    leading-edge node and Japanese companies may not generate
                    significant demand for such parts. Which is why Rapidus
                    needs to land orders from a multinational like

                    [...] It remains to be seen whether 5 to 10 companies can
                    generate enough demand to recoup tens of billions of dollars
                    that Rapidus will need to invest to start 2nm production in
                    2027. Meanwhile, winning even five customers with
                    significant 2nm orders in 2027 will be quite difficult,
                    since the number of companies willing to invest in designs
                    to be made on a leading-edge node is fairly limited.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then again, from Japanese government point of view, Rapidus
                    is meant to rejuvenate the

                    — so even if the company's 2nm node does not turn out to be
                    a triumph, it will still pave the way for successors and
                    open new doors to local chip designers.

                    "With the right battery size, it should be possible in many
                    cases to electrify heavy goods vehicles so that the cost is
                    the same or lower than if the they were powered by a diesel
                    engine. The best size of battery is determined by whether
                    light loads are being transported, such as parcels or
                    vegetables, or heavy loads, such as drinks or timber. Other
                    important factors that influence the choice of battery size
                    are driving patterns and the price of fast charging. A
                    realistic future scenario is that HGVs will have different
                    battery sizes," says Johannes Karlsson.

                      I did send it to matt, and got no response, which I did

                  Veyrdite asked, There are lots of opinions about which parts
                  of the org structure are problematic (and I suspect this will
                  get brought up in the meeting), so instead I am curious as to
                  which parts of the org structure work well? What should new

                      NCommander responded in part, "Ultimately, while I was in
                      the role in project manager, I also held the role of
                      president. And I acted as executioner of the communities
                      wishes. There's *a lot of very long posts to that*.
                      However, after I stepped down in 2021 from that role,
                      there essentially became a large disconnect to this. The
                      problems had been building well before that, but the
                      wheels essentially fell off when the business/legal side
                      became detached from the operations/community side of

                  Veyrdite asked, It sounds like having the org worked at first.
                  Would you suggest other (new) projects do an org the same way,

                      NCommander answered in part, "For the new org? It needs to
                      be specifically defined who is responsible for who does
                      what. And there needs to be a clear way to change the
                      guard. No one should be stuck in a position they don't
                      want to be, and people need to be replaceable; any of us
                      can be hit by a car tomorrow."

                      Kolie answered, "I approached NC when the shutdown
                      happened. We were discussing the site, its data, etc. I
                      agreed to an NDA to not disclose anything. As an outsider
                      - I was given access to the internals of the data, pbc,
                      etc. The purpose of the NDA was to safeguard the PBC from
                      liability given access to someone outside of everything.
                      It was overly broad, generic NDA. It has since been
                      removed and is not in effect. It was from legal zoom -
                      it's purpose literally for liability and there was no
                      nefarious background being discussed behind it. Everything
                      discussed at that time has since become public."

                  For the final question of the Q&amp;A session, Deucalion
                  asked, What are the next steps? Proposed first step is to
                  contact the suggested committee members to see if a committee
                  can indeed be formed as suggested.

                      The result of the question was discussion among the
                      potential governance committee members about forming the
                      committee.

                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>The governance committee</b></p>
              <p>
                As of this writing, the governance committee consists of kolie,
                audioguy, mechanicjay, requerdanos, Deucalion, and Fnord666,
                with possible other new members added from among staff/editors
                within the next few days.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of the committee, kolie says "The committee is to self govern
                and determine its own fate. I want a call to those who haven't
                accepted yet to answer - and to those interested to come around.
                [For] the community to participate in #governance and to work
                with myself as the chair or committee members to include their
                input and set up whatever's coming next."
              </p>
              <p>
                The business of the governance committee will happen in the
                #governance channel on SoylentNews IRC and in their expected
                upcoming meta and/or journal posts.

                    For more than 25 years, a technology used for critical data
                    and voice radio communications around the world has been
                    shrouded in secrecy to prevent anyone from closely
                    scrutinizing its security properties for vulnerabilities.
                    But now it's finally getting a public airing thanks to a
                    small group of researchers in the Netherlands who got their
                    hands on its viscera and found serious flaws, including a
                    deliberate backdoor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The backdoor, known for years by vendors that sold the
                    technology but not necessarily by customers, exists in an
                    encryption algorithm baked into radios sold for commercial
                    use in critical infrastructure. It's used to transmit
                    encrypted data and commands in pipelines, railways, the
                    electric grid, mass transit, and freight trains. It would
                    allow someone to snoop on communications to learn how a
                    system works, then potentially send commands to the radios
                    that could trigger blackouts, halt gas pipeline flows, or
                    reroute trains.

                  <p>
                    Researchers found a second vulnerability in a different part
                    of the same radio technology that is used in more
                    specialized systems sold exclusively to police forces,
                    prison personnel, military, intelligence agencies, and
                    emergency services, such as the<a

                    used by Dutch police, fire brigades, ambulance services, and
                    Ministry of Defense for mission-critical voice and data
                    communications. The flaw would let someone decrypt encrypted
                    voice and data communications and send fraudulent messages
                    to spread misinformation or redirect personnel and forces
                    during critical times.

                  <p>
                    Three Dutch security analysts discovered the
                    vulnerabilities—five in total—in a European radio standard
                    called TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio), which is used in
                    radios made by Motorola, Damm, Hytera, and others. The
                    standard has been used in radios since the '90s, but the
                    flaws remained unknown because encryption algorithms used in
                    TETRA were kept secret until now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers say anyone using radio technologies
                    should check with their manufacturer to determine if their
                    devices are using TETRA and what fixes or mitigations are
                    available.

                    which triggers an understanding that fulfilling those
                    obligations should be done harmoniously," explains Kim.
                    "Artificial intelligence (AI) imitates human intelligence,
                    so for robots to develop as rites bearers, they must be
                    powered by a type of AI that can imitate humans' capacity to

                    that we make robots in our image, if we don't treat them

                    degrade ourselves," he suggests.

                    The European Space Agency (ESA) has awarded a contract to a
                    US company to create a technology demonstrator for a
                    proposed aircraft monitoring system using low Earth orbit
                    satellites.

                    <a href="https://spire.com/">Spire Global</a>, headquartered
                    in San Francisco, won the €16 million ($17.6 million)
                    agreement for the EURIALO project, which aims to prove that
                    a satellite-based system can monitor aircraft in flight for
                    air traffic management purposes, without relying on any
                    existing systems.

                    intends to demonstrate the viability of using satellites to
                    track aircraft by determining in real time the aircraft
                    position based on timing the arrival of radio signals
                    detected by multiple satellites, a technique known as
                    multilateration. The radio signals in this case will be
                    standard telecoms radio signals already routinely broadcast
                    by aircraft.

                  <p>
                    Current monitoring systems largely rely on self-reported
                    positions of aircraft, which are typically obtained from
                    satellite navigation systems. The objective of EURIALO is to
                    provide a complementary tracking system that can feed
                    location data to existing air navigation service providers
                    for integration into their services.

                    Ultimately, this could help track planes in real time from
                    takeoff to landing anywhere in the world and could more
                    speedily locate aircraft in the event of an emergency. It
                    isn't clear whether such a system would have helped in the

                    Under the terms of the contract, Spire will develop a design
                    for an operational satellite constellation then deploy and
                    operate a demonstrator mission that proves the performance
                    of the service. It will head up a consortium of other

                    Humans have not traveled to the moon since Apollo 17 in
                    1972. The goal, however, is "not just returning, but staying
                    and exploring," says Merancy. Artemis II "is really ensuring
                    that the vehicles are ready for longer-duration missions in
                    the future."

                    International laws will need to be updated to cope with this
                    uptick in lunar activity. At the moment, such activities are
                    largely governed by the Outer Space Treaty, signed in 1967,
                    but many of its particulars are vague.

                    government precedent," says Scott Pace, a space policy

                    we learned how to live and work in low Earth orbit," says
                    Muir-Harmony. "Now there's this opportunity to learn how to
                    do that on another celestial body, and then travel to
                    Mars—and perhaps other locations."

                    Rumor mill: If you're considering buying an Intel CPU, it
                    might be a good idea to splash out sooner rather than later
                    as they could get a price hike. The claim comes from a new
                    report that states Team Blue is increasing the price of all
                    its Core lineup to help fund new fabs and restructure the
                    company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rumors that Intel's Core line is set for a price raise come
                    from German outlet

                    confirmed a letter revealing the hike.

                    According to the letter, all Core processors that are
                    currently on sale or in production will become more
                    expensive. That covers the Alder Lake (12xxx), Raptor Lake
                    (13xxx), and Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs. It also includes the
                    upcoming Meteor Lake processors that will be the first to

                  <p>
                    According to the letter, the price increases are related to
                    current and future Intel factories that have to be
                    refinanced. It also states that the company is
                    restructuring.

                    [...] It was only in January when Intel implemented the last
                    CPU price hike, an estimated 10% rise on the Alder Lake
                    chips' MSRP. It seems quite soon for another rise, but it
                    sounds like Intel could use the money.

                You may have noticed that Soylent News has no ads. How is that
                possible? It is possible because Soylent News was founded as a
                community, not a business. Our 'staff' is actually just unpaid
                members of the larger community, who step up and volunteer their
                time, because they support the idea of a purely user run news
                and discussion site. And that staff changes over time, sometimes
                people just burn out and decide to just go back to being normal
                members, some find themselves with increasing commitments or
                medical problems, or any number of other reasons. And its all
                fine, because others step up from the larger community and take
                up the tasks. Some later come back as well, when circumstances
                permit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since we have no paid staff, our expenses are pretty low. So
                others, perhaps without the time to contribute, help provide
                funds so we can continue to operate. These are members of the
                community who strongly support the idea of a community run site,
                free from the kind of corporate influence that has destroyed so
                many communities over the years.
              </p>
              <p>
                And for years, this amazing community approach has worked, it
                has kept the site going. The group has fended off two and a half
                attempts by corporations or monied interests to destroy it. The
                first was Dice, for Slashdot. The second was a person who held
                the name the community had selected hostage for money.
              </p>
              <p>
                The third...well, we THOUGHT we had fended that one off. It
                turned out to be a ticking time bomb, as some, including me, had
                warned about.
              </p>
              <p>Six months ago, that time bomb went off.</p>
              <p>
                At this point in time, all access by admins to our servers has
                been cut off. ONE person is making all admin decisions.
              </p>
              <p>The editors have just enough access to edit stories.</p>
              <p>
                All decisions are handed down from the top, the two -only-
                stockholders, and board members, who are the same people as the
                stockholders.
              </p>
              <p>
                An outside 'fixer' was called in with no consultation with staff
                under an agreement we have not seen and which was kept secret,
                when staff protested.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the top, there has been talk of adding advertising. Of
                looking for outside investors.

                It needs to be understood that much of what is being presented
                now is a sham. Elections for 'a' board seat or 'maybe' more?
                What good is that going to do?
              </p>
              <p>
                The simple truth is that Soylent PBC is a corporation. The
                ultimate power resides in the stockholders, not the board. The
                current two stockholders are there because promises were made
                that power would -never- be used. The present bylaws actually
                make it trivial for the stockholders to do that. But now it has
                been used, and abused.
              </p>
              <p>
                Until the bylaws are fixed the community is not in ultimate
                control of Soylent.

                  The first, and perhaps most important bit is the topic of
                  ownership, who owns the site. Well, the official position is
                  that SN is owned jointly by the staff, and despite Jon's
                  statements, he never legally owned what he sold, and
                  essentially held us hostage. At no time did Jon have any legal
                  basis to what he did, and this view is further compounded by
                  the fact that he willingly stepped down, and then gave
                  (followed by revoking) access to the DNS registrar and other
                  services. What Matt bought from Jon was essentially a lot of
                  hot air, and grounds for him to go off and stop bothering us;
                  this act was neither endorsed by the staff, nor associated
                  with us; it was an action he made of his own free will.

                They are acting as if we have a vote for the board of directors.
                We don't. Here is the what the current bylaws say about this:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    "2. Election and Qualification. Unless otherwise provided in
                    the Certificate of Incorporation or in these Bylaws the
                    number of Directors which shall constitute the whole Board
                    of Directors shall be determined by vote of the stockholders
                    at the annual meeting. Directors need not be stockholders."
                  </p>
                </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                There is more, but it all goes the same way - either the
                stockholders elect the board, or the board itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Only stockholders get a vote. In fact, any votes taken with
                anyone else are, at best, purely advisory. And current actions
                may be in direct conflict with the actual bylaws.
              </p>
              <p>
                Show me where they advised everyone of that fact in the current
                metas?
              </p>
              <p>
                The original plan in 2014 was that the bylaws would be
                re-written by the community.
              </p>
              <p>That promise has never been fulfilled.</p>

                    Hair loss has been reported by some semaglutide users. This

                    A stranded sailor and his dog have been rescued in the South
                    Pacific Ocean after months at sea, rescuers told Australian
                    media over the weekend.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The sailor, Tim Shaddock, 51, and Bella, the dog, departed
                    from La Paz, Mexico, three months ago. A month into his
                    journey, a storm struck his white catamaran, wiping out all
                    electronics,

                      >according to 9News</a
                    >. He says he and Bella survived three months at sea eating
                    raw fish and drinking rainwater.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They were rescued by a Mexican tuna trawler over the
                    weekend, 9News reported.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I have been through a very difficult ordeal at sea,"
                    Shaddock told the channel, adding that he had fishing and
                    other survival gear with him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Shaddock and Bella were spotted last week by a
                    helicopter accompanying a tuna trawler, which was on its way
                    back to Mexico, according to 9News. It was unclear when
                    Shaddock first left Mexico, and where he and Bella were
                    rescued.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Shaddock said he avoided sunburn by sheltering under
                    his boat's canopy, eating raw fish and drinking rainwater.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Not only did Shaddock have to look after himself, but
                    also his dog, which Tipton said, helped in the pair's
                    survival.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "He had companionship. Once you've got enough food and
                    water, then I think the dog has an advantage," Tipton said.
                    "Your survival time is as long as you can keep collecting
                    water, getting occasional food and doing things that help
                    you stay positive," he added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finding Shaddock was like a "needle in a haystack" in the
                    enormous Pacific Ocean, Tipton said, especially since the
                    helicopter was not even actively looking for him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It was a combination of luck and the right behavior," he
                    added.

                    "airburst" tests, the likes of which involved detonating
                    nuclear bombs in the Earth's upper atmosphere. These tests

                    The research could start a new conversation about how many
                    people are due compensation from the government over the
                    health impacts of the tests, the New York Times has
                    reported. The 1990 Radiation Exposure Compensation Act is a
                    federal statute designed to pay out money to communities and
                    individuals that have been impacted by government nuclear
                    testing, though the new research suggests that a much
                    broader area was potentially impacted by testing than the
                    legislation previously acknowledged. The report says that it
                    hopes its findings "provide an opportunity for re-evaluating
                    the public health and environmental implications from
                    atmospheric nuclear testing"

                    "What Hath Xerox Wrought" asked a 1976 Time Magazine
                    headline, the proceeding article prompted readers to imagine
                    if: "some inventive and omnipotent god offered the nation a
                    device that would greatly advance the spread of
                    information."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There was a catch though: the promethean powers afforded by
                    this "green-eyed deus ex machina" would also bring chaos:
                    "In return, the deity required that the President resign,
                    that stacks of sensitive Government and corporate secrets be
                    made public."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The writer was of course referring to the Watergate scandal
                    and Daniel Ellsberg's use of photocopiers to leak the
                    Pentagon Papers to the press. The hypothetical was actually
                    a reality. While the USSR kept strict control over the
                    technology, highly regulating the machines until 1989, the
                    free world was left to deal with the 'consequences' of
                    freedom.

                    Downsides of this supposed double edge sword - cited in Time
                    - would be encouraging waste and slothfulness, on top of
                    stifling creativity and punching holes in copyright laws.
                    This last issue was of particular concern to publishers and
                    authors, one that had been growing for more than a decade
                    because, as Malcolm McLaren would put it in 1993, "Gutenberg
                    made everyone a reader, Xerox made everyone a publisher..."

                    On Wednesday, Australia's Federal Court ordered two Meta
                    subsidiaries to pay $14 million after an over two and a half
                    year legal battle instigated by the country's competition
                    regulator found the pair misled users on the data collection
                    of a now defunct VPN app.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Israel-based web analytics company Onavo, maker of
                    free downloadable software application Onavo Protect, was

                    >
                    by Facebook in 2013. The narrative from Onavo at the time
                    was that privacy was king. Meanwhile Facebook promised the
                    company would be a separate brand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But by 2018, researchers were onto the tall tale and

                    Onavo Protect sent user data to Facebook even when turned
                    off – a situation that was outlined and permitted through
                    its terms and conditions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the ACCC [Australian Competition and Consumer
                    Commission], information collected and aggregated
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/16/australia_sues_facebook_over_onavo_vpn/"

                    app they accessed and the number of seconds each day they
                    spent using those apps" for Facebook's commercial benefit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] On Wednesday, the Australian court said that Onavo
                    Inc. and Facebook Israel promoted the VPN during 2016 and
                    2017 without sufficiently disclosing that data would be used
                    outside of the app.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If an Australian user of Onavo Protect had a Facebook
                    account, Meta was also able to combine that user's Onavo
                    Protect Data with information that Meta maintained about the
                    user's Facebook account, using an algorithm," wrote Judge
                    Wendy Abraham.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She further noted that internal Meta documents referred to
                    Onavo Protect as a "business intelligence tool," providing
                    "a sample of users who we are able to know nearly everything
                    they are doing on their mobile device." The data was then
                    used for advertising, marketing and improvement of products,
                    services and strategies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the Australian court, the terms and conditions
                    disclosing data use were not sufficient enough to counter
                    advertisements to the contrary. Court documents state that
                    both Facebook Israel and Onavo admit that ads and statements
                    were likely to mislead or deceive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Abraham said in court documents the fine "carries with
                    it a sufficient sting to ensure that the penalty amount is
                    not such as to be regarded by the parties or others as
                    simply an acceptable cost of doing business."

                    Since the vulnerability is in the hardware, a firmware
                    update from AMD is the best way to fully fix it; Ormandy
                    says it is also fixable via a software update, but it "may
                    have some performance cost." The bug affects all processors
                    based on AMD's Zen 2 architecture, including several Ryzen

                    Google seems to love creating specifications that are
                    terrible for the open web and it feels like they find a way
                    to create a new one every few months. This time, we have
                    come across some controversy caused by a new Web Environment
                    Integrity spec that Google seems to be working on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ​At this time, I could not find any official message from
                    Google about this spec, so it is possible that it is just
                    the work of some misguided engineer at the company that has
                    no backing from higher up, but it seems to be work that has
                    gone on for more than a year, and the resulting spec is so
                    toxic to the open Web that at this point, Google needs to at
                    least give some explanation as to how it could go so far.

                    [...] Prioleau described himself as "the only full time
                    employee" of the Linux Foundation-based group. Otherwise,
                    the Foundation has depended on around 130 engineers from
                    Meta, Microsoft, and more of the steering companies. As far
                    as maintaining the data, the Overture head said that there's
                    no contractual agreement for companies to use the open
                    source resources, but they're still heavily encouraging all
                    those who build upon their foundation to somehow give back
                    to the data source with any new information they collect.

                    Overture, start building your own dataset and not give stuff
                    back, then you're on your own to maintain that dataset going
                    forward." Prioleau said. "So the incentive to giving back is
                    that your data remains part of this consortium."

                    The upcoming meeting will be to nominate one or more
                    qualified candidates to serve on the Board. The PBC exists
                    to define what and how SoylentNews will be and to enforce
                    that vision. Ultimately the Board is responsible for the
                    high-level oversight that ensures the bylaws are fulfilled.
                    The purpose of the expansion is to include more voices from
                    the community so they will be directly represented in the
                    decision making [affecting] the community. The next meeting
                    will be held over IRC and will be answering and addressing
                    your questions and concerns from any of the comments posted
                    in this article.

                    A brief power outage at NASA's Mission Control in Houston
                    meant that the space agency lost contact with the
                    International Space Station on Tuesday. During the outage,
                    flight controllers were able to talk to the crew through
                    Russian Space Agency Roscosmos's channels.

                    control team transitioned to back-up hardware for telemetry,
                    commanding and audio.

                    the astronauts nor station were ever in any danger and that

                    systems, within 20 minutes of the outage.

                    It's the first time NASA has had to fire up these backup
                    systems to take control, according to Montalbano.

                    [...] NASA maintains a backup control center miles from
                    Houston in the event a hurricane or other disaster requiring
                    evacuations. But in Tuesday's case, the flight controllers
                    stayed at Mission Control since the lights and
                    air-conditioning still worked.

                    After one of teenager Rohan Kalia's family members was
                    diagnosed with glaucoma, he began researching an affordable
                    technology that could be used for early detection. Kalia is

                    Mainframe computers are often seen as ancient
                    machines—practically dinosaurs. But mainframes, which are
                    purpose-built to process enormous amounts of data, are still
                    extremely relevant today. If they're dinosaurs, they're
                    T-Rexes, and desktops and server computers are puny mammals
                    to be trodden underfoot. It's estimated that there are
                    10,000 mainframes in use today. They're used almost
                    exclusively by the largest companies in the world, including
                    two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies, 45 of the world's top
                    50 banks, eight of the top 10 insurers, seven of the top 10
                    global retailers, and eight of the top 10 telecommunications
                    companies. And most of those mainframes come from IBM. In
                    this explainer, we'll look at the IBM mainframe
                    computer—what it is, how it works, and why it's still going
                    strong after over 50 years.

                claims South Korean scientists have created the world's first
                room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductor. The
                superconducting material, dubbed 'LK-99', is synthesized in a
                fairly simple manner from lead-apatite. As yet, there seems to
                be no independent verification of the claims of their paper.

                    As thin, light, and inexpensive as Chromebooks can be, they
                    come with a major caveat: short life expectancies.
                    Chromebooks aren't just a little flimsier than the average
                    laptop—they're shipped with software "death dates" that
                    render them useless three to six years after release. And
                    because schools are some of Chromebooks' biggest customers,
                    they're now swamped with bricked hardware.

                    The Chromebook crisis is apparent at northern California's
                    Oakland Unified School District (OUSD), where thousands of
                    laptops have reportedly stopped working. Sam Berg, the
                    district's computer science coordinator,

                    Silicon Valley's Mercury News that while Oakland students
                    can gain tech repair experience through an OUSD internship,
                    the expired Chromebooks simply aren't fixable. "They're
                    designed to be disposable," Berg said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The district was forced to replace 3,851 laptops last year
                    after the Chromebooks reached their built-in death dates.
                    Over the next five years, that number will skyrocket to
                    40,000 as more than 60 Chromebook models expire. The
                    district's tech internship for teenagers will attempt to
                    salvage as much hardware as possible, but most will need to
                    be recycled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google told OUSD the baked-in death dates are necessary for
                    security and compatibility purposes. As Google continues to
                    iterate on its Chromebook software, older devices supposedly
                    can't handle the updates. But this illustrates a
                    particularly contentious issue in modern technology:

                    things with the knowledge that they'll need to be replaced
                    in just a few years. Not only is this expensive, but it
                    produces a shocking amount of e-waste, less than a quarter

                    integration of human brain cells with artificial
                    intelligence (AI).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers are confident in their work and have
                    ambitious goals for the technology. Adeel Razi, the team
                    lead and associate professor at Monarch University, stated
                    that this new technology may eventually surpass the
                    performance of traditional silicon-based hardware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This new technology capability in the future may eventually
                    surpass the performance of existing, purely silicon-based
                    hardware," said Adeel Razi, team lead and associate profess
                    at Monarch University, in a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The potential applications of this research span multiple
                    fields, including planning, robotics, advanced automation,
                    brain-computer interfaces, and drug discovery, granting
                    Australia a significant strategic advantage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This ambitious project will undoubtedly require
                    considerable time and effort to complete. With the grant,
                    they aim to develop AI machines that can replicate the
                    learning capacity of biological neural networks. Ultimately,
                    they hope to scale up the hardware and methods to a level
                    where these systems can viably replace traditional in
                    silicon computing.

                    "The way we see the economy is through the lens of how it
                    used to be in the past, not how it is today," is how Dame
                    Coyle puts it.

                    [...] The other argument is that the current technological
                    revolution is happening, but just more slowly than we
                    expect.

                    Nick Crafts is emeritus professor of economic history at the
                    University of Sussex Business School. He points out that the
                    huge sea changes in economic performance we tend to think of
                    as having happened almost overnight, actually took decades,
                    and the same may well be happening how.

                    "James Watt's steam engine was patented in 1769," he says.
                    "Yet the first serious commercial railway, the Liverpool to
                    Manchester line only opened in 1830, and the core of the
                    railway network was built by 1850. That was 80 years after
                    the patent."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can see the same pattern in the use of electricity. The
                    time from Edison's first public use of the light bulb in
                    1879, to the electrification of whole countries and the
                    replacement of steam power in manufacturing was at least 40
                    years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In fact, we might be in a similar hiatus at the moment,
                    something like when the world was between the peak of steam
                    power and the full development of electricity.

                    Sam Altman's cryptocurrency project, the Worldcoin
                    Foundation, is rolling out its services globally even as the
                    company cofounded by the OpenAI chief faces regulatory
                    pushback in the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Berlin and San Francisco-based start-up announced on
                    Monday that its technology, including its Worldcoin token—a
                    cryptocurrency traceable on the blockchain that requires
                    users to first prove their identity—will be available in 35
                    cities across 20 countries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Central to the effort is an eye-scanning physical "orb,"
                    which Worldcoin's founders say is necessary for a future in
                    which distinguishing between humans and robots becomes
                    increasingly challenging due to a surge in artificial
                    intelligence technology. Once users have proven they are not
                    robots, they can be issued one of the company's tokens.<br /><br />[...]
                    Altman admitted that eye-scanning technology has "a clear
                    ick factor," but he is confident that with proper
                    explanation the company can attract users.

                  <p>
                    "On crypto, there have been a lot of bad actors and that's a
                    real shame... we have to earn people's trust, which is why
                    we're explaining so much about how the technology works and
                    the road map for decentralizing the company," he said.

                    In his three-page ruling, [U.S. District Judge] John J.

                    Most examinations of the gastrointestinal region involve
                    sending a thin tube with a camera affixed to the tip either
                    down your throat to the small intestine or through the
                    rectum to the colon, neither of which are pleasant
                    experiences.

                  <p>
                    However, an innovative, and increasingly attractive --
                    albeit less common -- method is to dispatch a camera housed
                    in a small, vitamin pill-shaped capsule along with silver
                    oxide batteries on its maiden voyage down into your gut.

                    [...] While this process sounds great so far, there's a
                    problem. Ingestible devices, as amazing as they are, require
                    medical oversight while they're administered and they
                    sometimes get lodged into the mountainous crevices of your
                    innards.

                    The real surprise came when we searched the oldest radio
                    observations of this part of the sky. The Very Large Array
                    in New Mexico, United States, has the longest-running
                    archive of data. We found pulses from the source in data
                    from every year we looked—the oldest one in an observation
                    made in 1988.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Observing over three decades meant we could precisely time
                    the pulses. The source is producing them like clockwork,
                    every 1,318.1957 seconds, give or take a tenth of a
                    millisecond.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to our current theories, for the source to be
                    producing radio waves, it should be slowing down. But
                    according to the observations, it is not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In our
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06202-5"
                      >article in Nature</a
                    >, we show that the source lies "below the death line,"
                    which is the theoretical limit of how neutron stars generate
                    radio waves; this holds even for quite complex magnetic
                    field models. Not only that, but if the source is a
                    magnetar, the radio emission should only be visible for a
                    few months to years—not 33 years and counting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, it's very tempting at this point to reach to
                    extraterrestrial intelligence as an option. The same thing
                    happened when pulsars were discovered: astrophysicist
                    Jocelyn Bell Burnell and her colleagues, who found the first
                    pulsar, nicknamed it "LGM 1," for "Little Green Men 1."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While it's tempting to try to explain a new phenomenon
                    this way, it's a bit of a cop out. It doesn't encourage us
                    to keep thinking, observing and testing new ideas. I call it
                    the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps"
                      >aliens of the gaps</a
                    >" approach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fortunately, this source is still active, so anyone in the
                    world can observe it. Perhaps with creative follow-up
                    observations, and more analysis, we'll be able to solve this
                    new cosmic mystery.

                    Chainguard is a company led by former Googlers behind the
                    Sigstore project. It's trying to pull it all together into a
                    cohesive toolchain for developers. The startup's early
                    efforts were focused on steps to lock down the build process
                    and make features such as signatures, provenance, and SBOMs
                    native to software supply chains and the software build
                    process. Last year with Wolfi they
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/software-supply-chain-security-first-linux-distro-wolfi/"
                      >introduced the first community Linux</a
                    >  (un)distribution built specifically around supply chain
                    security primitives. They also launched Chainguard Images,
                    which are base images for stand-alone binaries, applications
                    like nginx, and development tools such as Go and C
                    compilers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Developers, security professionals, and even auditors
                    need to know what software packages are deployed, where
                    they're deployed, and by whom. SBOMs are designed to help
                    answer these questions and more, but the more complex an
                    environment is, the harder this is to pull off. Clusters
                    often run hundreds of workloads with hundreds of container
                    images, while each container image has hundreds if not
                    thousands of packages. We're still so early in SBOMs that
                    most packages don't ship with SBOMs; they need to be
                    generated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] By making it easy for developers to either ingest or
                    automatically create SBOMs for packages that don't yet have
                    them, Chainguard is providing a much higher fidelity corpus
                    of data for vulnerability detection. Plus, Enforce's new
                    vulnerability scanning can tell teams whether and exactly
                    where they are running an artifact with a CVE.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All of this is arriving just in time. No developer wants to
                    be first to have to figure out how to use SBOMs. Yet they
                    don't have a choice: The combination of FedRAMP and
                    self-attestation requirements is driving an immediate need
                    for consistent visibility into software packages and
                    automated processes for finding and rooting out
                    vulnerabilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you want to sell to the U.S. federal government, SBOMs
                    will soon be a requirement. But it's not just for those
                    selling to the government. It's reasonable to assume the new
                    self-attestation model for assigning legal liability for
                    insecure software will likely make SBOMs common security
                    fare across the entire tech industry—or at least for
                    software companies that don't want to be named in future
                    class action lawsuits.

                I highly encourage anyone who wants to participate and improve
                SoylentNews now and in the future to seriously consider pursuing
                involvement in the PBC as an officer, board member, or committee
                leader/member. At the very least get in touch with someone who
                is in such a position and offer them your suggestions.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe it is very important for the PBC and Community to
                discuss and begin to draft items for consideration by the PBC
                which will formalize the process and delegation of the community
                involvement and decision-making process. In my mind this takes
                the form of setting up a community governance committee which I
                volunteer to chair. This community should be tasked with
                exploring and proposing the very changes necessary to empower
                community involvement again.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I am a member of the PBC I always am acutely aware that
                ultimately the PBC is beholden to the community of which we
                serve. To that end rather than I or PBC dictate solutions to the
                numerous problems we face let’s find a way that we can do so
                together.

                    A ground-breaking study has revealed that plants can
                    efficiently remove toxic petrol fumes, including cancer
                    causing compounds such as benzene, from indoor air.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study was led by University of Technology Sydney (UTS)
                    bioremediation researcher Associate Professor Fraser Torpy,
                    in partnership with leading plantscaping solutions company
                    Ambius.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers found that the Ambius small green wall,
                    containing a mix of indoor plants, was highly effective at
                    removing harmful, cancer-causing pollutants, with 97 per
                    cent of the most toxic compounds removed from the
                    surrounding air in just eight hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ambius General Manager Johan Hodgson said the research
                    presented new evidence into the critical role played by
                    indoor plants and green walls in cleaning the air we breathe
                    quickly and sustainably.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We know that indoor air quality is often significantly more
                    polluted than outdoor air, which in turn impacts mental and
                    physical health. But the great news is this study has shown
                    that something as simple as having plants indoors can make a
                    huge difference," Mr Hodgson said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Previous studies on indoor plants have shown they can remove
                    a broad range of indoor air contaminants, however this is
                    the first study into the ability of plants to clean up
                    petrol vapours, which are one of the largest sources of
                    toxic compounds in buildings worldwide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "At Ambius, we see over and over again the effects
                    plants have in improving health, wellbeing, productivity and
                    office attendance for the thousands of businesses we work
                    with. This new research proves that plants should not just
                    be seen as 'nice to have', but rather a crucial part of
                    every workplace wellness plan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The bottom line is that the best, most cost effective and
                    most sustainable way to combat harmful indoor air
                    contaminants in your workplace and home is to introduce
                    plants," Mr Hodgson said.

                    started several years ago, when the scientists happened upon
                    samples collected from an extraordinary, Cold War-era

                    in northwestern Greenland to build a network of mobile
                    nuclear launch sites under the ice sheet," Rittenour says.
                    "As part of that project, they also invited scientists and
                    engineers to conduct experiments in a highly publicized
                    'cover' project, known as Camp Century, to study the
                    feasibility of working and carrying out military missions
                    under ice and in extreme-cold conditions."

                    Hampered by brutal blizzards and unstable ice conditions,
                    Project Iceworm's cavernous underground bunker and tunnels
                    were abandoned in 1966. But sediment samples collected at
                    the bottom of a more than 4,000-foot-long ice core extracted
                    from the site have yielded the surprising information about
                    Greenland's not-so-distant geologic past.

                    The frozen soil samples from the base of the Camp Century

                    [...] Rittenour says today's investigative technologies
                    enable researchers to distill a good record of what's
                    happened in Greenland and other parts of the world.

                    climate," she says. "If we can lose the far northwest
                    portion of the Greenland ice sheet under natural conditions,
                    then we're treading dangerous waters given current elevated

                    The International Seabed Authority's member nations on
                    Friday agreed on a two-year roadmap for the adoption of deep
                    sea mining regulations, despite conservationists' calls for
                    a moratorium on mineral extraction they say would avert
                    marine threats.

                    The ISA, an intergovernmental body tasked with protecting
                    the seabed, and its member states have spent the last decade
                    trying to hash out a mining code for the possible
                    exploitation of nickel, cobalt and copper in deep seabed
                    areas that fall outside of national jurisdictions.
                  </p>
                  <p>But an agreement has so far been elusive.</p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since July 9, after the expiration of a deadline
                    triggered by the small Pacific state of Nauru in 2021, the
                    ISA is obligated to consider—though not necessarily
                    grant—licenses for potentially environmentally devastating
                    mining operations if governments request them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That would go beyond the status quo, which has so far only
                    seen the body grant exploration permits, as the deep sea
                    mining sector itches to take off in earnest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are no longer in a 'what if' scenario, but rather 'what
                    now'," Nauru's ambassador to the ISA Margo Deiye said during
                    the session, adding that her government planned to soon
                    apply for a mining contract
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Next week, the ISA Assembly and its 167 member states
                    will discuss for the first time a "precautionary pause" in
                    mining, supported by about 20 countries, including France,
                    Chile and Brazil.

                    That said, you need not be an existing fan of

                    are Easter eggs for long-time devotees, and it's a more
                    rewarding viewing experience if you are at least
                    <em>somewhat</em> familiar with the show—but the plot
                    callbacks are explained enough so that new viewers should be
                    able to follow along.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Though it can sometimes feel like the show is racing
                    along trying to cram in fan-favorite characters (Robot
                    Devil! Calculon! Robot Santa Claus! The Hypnotoad!), and
                    that first episode leans awfully hard into the
                    self-referential stuff, it all feels very rooted in the show
                    Futurama has always been—with weird asides, clever gags, and
                    characters you can't help but love, even though they tend to
                    always do the wrong thing. The leap to 2023 feels as
                    seamless as it could possibly feel, which is truly the
                    greatest way to please old-school fans and, hopefully, the
                    legions of new ones this revival will bring into the fold.

                    With a summer of extreme weather records dominating the

                    give a glimpse of the big picture: a warming planet caused
                    by climate change. It's a picture that comes in the vibrant
                    reds and purples representing heat on daily weather maps

                        Apple says it will remove services such as FaceTime and

                        proposals are made law and acted upon. The government is
                        seeking to update the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA)
                        2016. It wants messaging services to clear security
                        features with the Home Office before releasing them to
                        customers. The act lets the Home Office demand security
                        features are disabled, without telling the public. Under
                        the update, this would have to be immediate. [...]

                    The U.K. legislators pushing this believe, wrongly, that it
                    must be possible for these messaging platforms to add "good
                    guys only" back doors. That if they pass this law, the
                    result will be that the nerds who work at these companies
                    will be forced to figure out a way to comply. What will
                    actually happen is that these companies will be forced to
                    pull the services from U.K., because they can't comply,
                    unless they scrap their current end-to-end encryption and
                    replace it — worldwide — with something insecure, which they
                    aren't going to do.

                    expected," David Jewitt, a planetary scientist at The
                    University of California, Los Angeles, said in a statement.
                    "We see a cloud of boulders carrying mass and energy away
                    from the impact target. The numbers, sizes, and shapes of
                    the boulders are consistent with them having been knocked
                    off the surface of Dimorphos by the impact."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The boulders are some of the faintest things ever imaged
                    inside our solar system," Jewitt added.

                    clinicians a fuller picture of what data were used to build
                    algorithms. Kathryn Marchesini, the agency's chief privacy

                    label" that helps doctors know "the ingredients used to make
                    the algorithm." The hope is more transparency will help
                    providers determine if an algorithm is unbiased enough to

                    Environmental Discs of Tron (or EDOT for short) is arguably
                    the most complex arcade cabinet of the Golden Age of
                    videogaming. Working examples are hard to come by, and when
                    they do, you can expect to pay handsomely for one!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What sets this game apart, is the thought that went into the
                    cabinet design. Brian Colin (who we interviewed on the
                    podcast a while back here), worked extensively on the game.
                    Have a listen to his recollections of what made the game and
                    cabinet so special.

                    So, finding one of these glorious pieces is a challenge
                    these days. But can you imagine stumbling across one dumped
                    in the street? Well, that's exactly what happened to my
                    friend Tim Lapetino recently.

                        I was visiting my family in the Chicago suburbs
                        recently, when my niece mentioned she saw "some TRON
                        thing" sitting on a curb while she was riding her bike
                        through the neighbourhood.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Of course we jumped in the car to go take a look, as it
                        was just blocks away from where my parents and other
                        family live. As we drove up to the spot, I uttered "What
                        the &amp;*@$?!" forgetting that my niece was in the car
                        with us. And would you believe it – there it was. An
                        EDOT was sitting by the curb
