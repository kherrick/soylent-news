                Many people believe that any and all opposition to the Covid
                vaccine comes from "far-right" Republican conspiracy theorists
                in the flyover states. I guess the Swiss government will now be
                branded with those labels as their Federal Office of Public
                Health is now recommending that a Covid vaccination is
                <b>not needed</b>, even for people at especially high risk. They
                list pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems
                as an exception. They further state that those who wish to
                receive a Covid vaccine must pay for it out of their own
                pockets.

                    In principle, no COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for
                    spring/summer 2023. Nearly everyone in Switzerland has been
                    vaccinated and/or contracted and recovered from COVID-19.
                    Their immune system has therefore been exposed to the
                    coronavirus. In spring/summer 2023, the virus will likely
                    circulate less. The current virus variants also cause rather
                    mild illness. For autumn 2023, the vaccination
                    recommendation will be evaluated again and adjusted
                    accordingly.

                    Gaming hardware manufacturer MSI confirmed today that it was
                    the victim of a cyberattack. In a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Statement-141688"
                      >brief statement on its website</a
                    >, the company said that the attack hit "part of its
                    information systems," which have since returned to regular
                    operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company advises its customers only to get BIOS and
                    firmware updates from the MSI website and no other sources.
                    It's light on details, saying that after "detecting network
                    anomalies," MSI implemented "defense mechanisms and carried
                    out recovery measures," and then informed the the government
                    and law enforcement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The post doesn't mention if customer data was stolen
                    or affected. Tom's Hardware reached out to MSI but did not
                    hear back in time for publication. In addition, emails to
                    official spokesperson addresses listed on the company's
                    website bounced.

                    business unit is partnering with the British chip design
                    firm <a href="https://www.arm.com/">Arm Ltd.</a> to enable
                    semiconductor designers to build low-power systems-on-chip
                    on its cutting-edge manufacturing process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The companies will initially focus on mobile SoC designs
                    before expanding the deal to cover chips for automotive,
                    internet of things, data center, aerospace and government
                    applications. Under the agreement, customers that use Arm's
                    designs as the basis of their chips will be able to use
                    Intel's 18A process technology to manufacture their
                    products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The deal is said to be a big boon for customers, since Intel
                    18A is a more advanced process with capacity in both the
                    U.S. and Europe. It will allow customers to design chips
                    using electronic design automation software from third-party
                    suppliers. EDA software is used by semiconductor engineers
                    to create processor blueprints. The result will be more
                    powerful processors with greater energy efficiency, Intel
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under the initiative, IFS and Arm will work together on
                    design technology co-optimization, wherein chip design and
                    process manufacturing are optimized to improve the power,
                    performance and cost of Arm-based cores using the Intel 18A
                    technology. Intel 18A is said to leverage two new
                    technologies, including PowerVia for optimal power delivery
                    and RibbonFET "gate all around" transistor architecture,
                    which ensures optimal performance and power.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As part of this cooperation, IFS and Arm plan to develop a
                    mobile reference design to demonstrate the technology to
                    customers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The deal is another key milestone for IFS, following its

                    with the Taiwanese semiconductor firm MediaTek Inc. that was
                    announced last July. Intel set up the foundry business in
                    2021 to manufacture chips for other companies based on their
                    own custom designs.

                    A similar case in Germany was brought by Sony Music against

                      >free, recursive, anycast DNS platform Quad9</a
                    >. Like CDNs, DNS platforms are crucial services that ensure
                    that the Internet can function smoothly; they are not
                    involved with any of the sites that may be accessed as a
                    result of their services. In particular, they have no
                    knowledge of whether copyright material on those sites is
                    authorised or not. Unfortunately, two regional courts in
                    Germany don't seem to understand that point, and have issued

                    explains why this is a dreadful result for the entire
                    Internet:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        The court argues with the German law principle of
                        "interferer liability" the so-called "Stoererhaftung",
                        which allows holding uninvolved third parties liable for
                        an infringement if they have in some way adequately and
                        causally contributed to the infringement of a protected
                        legal interest. If DNS resolvers can be held liable as
                        interferers, this would set a dangerous precedent for
                        all services used in retrieving web pages. Providers of
                        browsers, operating systems or antivirus software could
                        be held liable as interferers on the same grounds if
                        they do not prevent the accessibility of
                        copyright-infringing websites.

                    Now an Italian court has confirmed a previous ruling that

                    accused of making available unauthorised copies of material.
                    That's unfortunate, since taken with the German court
                    rulings it is likely to encourage the copyright industry to
                    widen its attack on the Internet's plumbing, regardless of
                    the wider harm this is likely to cause.

                    Open source also paves the way for anyone, regardless of
                    their scientific background, to pitch in and help push
                    science forward. Many of these projects can benefit from
                    experienced software engineers, as software engineering
                    isn't always a strength for scientific researchers. "The
                    scientific community is trying to learn best software
                    development practices, but there's a lot to learn from
                    professional developers," says MIT's Peterson. "There are
                    lots of opportunities for experienced developers to help
                    build CI/CD pipelines, write unit tests, and generally help
                    create higher-quality codebases."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Contributing to a project's upstream dependencies is another
                    way to help out, LLNL's Peterson says. Merlin, for example,
                    relies heavily on the Python-based distributed task queue
                    <a href="https://github.com/celery/celery">Celery</a>. And,
                    like practically all open source projects, these need help
                    with documentation and bug reports. "We can never get enough
                    documentation, and not all of it needs to be written by
                    specialists," Gaston says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Opening repositories to specialists and non-specialists
                    alike for collaboration is a far cry from the
                    cloak-and-dagger image that the nuclear physics field
                    cultivated over the decades. But it's a big part of what
                    pushes science forward as creators gain valuable
                    contributions from outside their own organizations. "We have
                    hundreds of contributors at this point," says Permann, the
                    manager of the MOOSE project. "It's not just the National
                    Labs and universities either. Private companies are a little
                    more cautious about what they contribute to open source, but
                    they help out as well and there's a mutual benefit."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It also encourages the teams to write better code in the
                    first place. "We treat every pull request like it's a
                    submission to an academic journal," Kolev says. "When you
                    know your code is going to be scrutinized by other people,
                    it sets a higher bar."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Though secrecy still has its place, it takes openness to
                    keep moving forward.

                    [...] In Rondo's system, electricity travels through a
                    heating element, where it's transformed into heat. It's the
                    same mechanism that a toaster uses, O'Donnell says—just a
                    lot bigger and hotter. The heat then radiates through the
                    stack of bricks, warming them up to temperatures that can
                    reach over 1,500 °C (2,700 °F).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The insulated steel container housing the bricks can keep
                    them hot for hours or even days. When it's time to use the
                    trapped heat, fans blow air through the bricks. The air can
                    reach temperatures of up to 1,000 °C (1,800 °F) as it
                    travels through the gaps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    How the final heat then is used will depend on the
                    commercial process, O'Donnell says, though many facilities
                    will probably use it to turn water into high-pressure steam.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Rondo isn't alone in its quest to deploy heat
                    batteries in industry.
                    <a href="https://antoraenergy.com/">Antora Energy</a>, based
                    in California, is also building heat storage systems, using
                    carbon. "It's super simple—it's literally just solid
                    blocks," says cofounder and COO Justin Briggs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead of using a separate heating element (like Rondo's
                    "toaster coil") to turn electricity into heat, Antora's
                    system will use carbon blocks as a resistive heater, so
                    they'll both generate and store heat. This could cut down on
                    costs and complexity, Briggs explains. But the choice will
                    also mean the system needs to be carefully enclosed, since
                    graphite and other forms of carbon can degrade at high
                    temperatures in the air.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Even using commercially available materials, it'll
                    take a while for heat storage to prove its role to
                    manufacturers and make a meaningful dent in industrial
                    emissions. But the technology could be one building block of
                    a new, climate-friendly industrial sector. "We have all the
                    tools we need to transform to a zero-carbon economy,"
                    O'Donnell says. Now it's time to build them.

                    scams are no longer just princes offering their country's
                    riches. They are forlorn strangers looking for romance, hot
                    new cryptocurrencies that are soon to skyrocket in value,
                    and seemingly-sound new financial websites offering amazing

                    [...] Companies like OpenAI attempt to prevent their models
                    from doing bad things. But with the release of each new LLM,
                    social media sites buzz with new AI jailbreaks that evade
                    the new restrictions put in place by the AI's designers.
                    ChatGPT, and then Bing Chat, and then GPT-4 were all
                    jailbroken within minutes of their release, and in dozens of
                    different ways. Most protections against bad uses and
                    harmful output are only skin-deep, easily evaded by
                    determined users. Once a jailbreak is discovered, it usually
                    can be generalized, and the community of users pulls the LLM
                    open through the chinks in its armor. And the technology is
                    advancing too fast for anyone to fully understand how they
                    work, even the designers.

                    like a vast bendy straw. The finding suggests a new way for
                    galaxies to grow in the early universe, researchers report
                    in the March 31 <em>Science</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Computer simulations predicted that streams of gas should
                    connect galaxies to the
                    <a

                    >
                    (<em>SN: 3/6/23</em>). But astronomers expected that gas to
                    be warm, making it unsuitable for star-forming fuel and
                    galaxy growth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So astronomer Bjorn Emonts and his colleagues were surprised
                    to see a stream of cold, star-forming gas leading into the
                    Anthill Galaxy, a massive galaxy whose light takes 12
                    billion years to reach Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "People didn't think that these streams could get so
                    cold," says Emonts, of the National Radio Astronomy
                    Observatory in Charlottesville, Va.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But there, in the data, a frigid stream stretched at least
                    325,000 light-years away from the galaxy. The stream carries
                    the mass of 70 billion suns and deposits the equivalent of
                    about 450 suns in cold gas onto the galaxy every year, the
                    team calculated. That's enough to double the galaxy's mass
                    within a billion years.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    The Raspberry Pi Code editor isn't the only online Python
                    editor around by any stretch of the imagination as you can
                    also use a service such as
                    <a href="https://trinket.io/">Trinket.io</a>, which will let
                    you write Python code in one pane while previewing it in
                    another. However, what's interesting about Raspberry Pi's
                    tool is that the organization has a few Python tutorials
                    that are designed to be used with it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Raspberry Pi Foundation already had a nice set of Python
                    tutorials on its site, but it has adapted some of them to
                    open sample code directly in the online editor. For example,
                    when I tried the
                    <a
                      href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/hello-world-editor/1"
                      >"Say hello" lesson</a
                    >, the first link on the page opens the working set of code
                    in the editor in a new tab in my browser. When I revisited
                    the page and clicked the link a few minutes later, it took
                    me back to the same code I had edited before, because it
                    saved the lesson as a project that was associated with my
                    account.

                    The draft version contained data that showed that getting
                    COVID-19 posed a far greater risk of cardiac-related deaths
                    than that from mRNA vaccines. Specifically, the incidence of
                    cardiac-related deaths from infection was more than 10 times
                    higher than from the vaccine in people ages 18 to 24 and
                    more than five times higher for people 25 to 39. This data
                    is in line with

                    but was omitted entirely from the final analysis announced
                    by Ladapo.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also omitted was a sensitivity analysis that showed that the
                    risk of cardiac-related deaths in young men was not
                    significant. The final version drew flak for not including a
                    sensitivity analysis, with the core conclusion of risk in
                    young men hinging on just 20 deaths. A sensitivity analysis
                    is a means to essentially evaluate the robustness of a
                    finding, and it was present in three versions of the draft
                    analysis but not in the final one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Overall, the draft versions of the analysis written by
                    state epidemiologists <em>supported</em> the use of mRNA.
                    "The risk associated with COVID-19 infection clearly
                    outweighs any potential risks associated with mRNA
                    vaccination," one version states.

                    Matt Hitchings, an infectious disease epidemiologist and
                    professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, who
                    also reviewed the drafts for the Times, told the outlet that
                    the excluded data was akin to academic dishonesty. "You can
                    call it a lie by omission," he said.

                    The core of the challenge here is that the paradigm has
                    changed. When you look at the first year of Ingenuity's
                    extended operations, we were still in the Three Forks area,
                    where the ground was flat. We could get line of sight from
                    the helicopter to the rover from hundreds and hundreds of
                    meters away. Our longest link that we established was 1.2
                    kilometers—a massive distance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And then we started to realize that the rover was going to
                    enter the river delta in like six months. It's going to
                    start climbing up through dozens and dozens of meters of
                    elevation change and passing through ravines, and that's
                    going to start presenting a telecom issue for us. We knew
                    that it couldn't be business as usual anymore—if we still
                    wanted to keep this helicopter mission going, not only did
                    we need to change the way we were operating, but we also had
                    to change the helicopter itself.

                    The records obtained by WIRED are more focused. They follow
                    a previously unreported directive to staff of the San
                    Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency handed down last
                    October to improve record keeping of incidents involving
                    autonomous vehicles. Muni, as the agency is known,
                    standardized the term "driverless car" when staff report
                    "near-misses, collisions or other incidents resulting in
                    transit delay," according to the directive. Agency logs show
                    12 "driverless" reports from September 2022 through March 8,
                    2023, though Muni video was provided for only eight of these
                    cases. Overall, the incidents resulted in at least 83
                    minutes of direct delays for Muni riders, records show.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That data likely doesn't reflect the true scale of the
                    problem. Muni staff don't follow every directive to the
                    letter, and a single delay can slow other lines, worsening
                    the blow. Buses and trains cannot weave around blockages as
                    easily as pedestrians, other motorists, and cyclists,
                    saddling transit-dependent travelers with some of the
                    biggest headaches caused by errant driverless cars,
                    according to transit advocates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That left the Muni driver in a bind. "I can't move the bus,"
                    the driver said to one of two riders on board. "The car is
                    automatic driving." The driver radioed managers and doffed
                    their cap: "Whoosh ... Half hour, one hour. I don't know.
                    Nothing to do." Thirty-eight stops and about five miles
                    remained ahead for the 54. The driver, looking out at the
                    Waymo, expressed disappointment: "This one not smart yet.
                    Not smart. Not good."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Waymo's Karp says one of the company's roadside assistance
                    crews arrived within 11 minutes of being dispatched to drive
                    the SUV, clearing the blockage about 15 minutes after it
                    began. Karp declined to elaborate on why the remote
                    responder's guidance failed but said engineers have since
                    introduced an unspecified change that allows addressing
                    "these rare situations faster and with more flexibility."

                    Tumlin, the Muni director, says San Francisco's transit
                    workers are frustrated. "When you encounter a vehicle with
                    no human on board, it is dispiriting and disempowering," he
                    says. "There's no one there to communicate with at all."

                    The processor supports 2P and 4P configurations; therefore,
                    Loongson has launched the 7A2000 bridge chip to manage the
                    communication between the processors and other components.
                    As per the chip designer, the 7A2000 is up to 400% faster
                    than the previous generation. Furthermore, with the help of
                    the 7A2000, there's a possibility to scale up to 128 cores
                    per motherboard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Loongson's provided numbers, the 3D5000 scores
                    over 425 points in SPEC CPU 2006, a depreciated benchmark
                    replaced with the newer SPEC CPU 2017 version. The 3D5000
                    also delivers over 1 TFLOPs of FP64 performance, up to 4X
                    higher than regular Arm cores. Meanwhile, the processor's
                    stream performance with eight channels of DDR4-3200 memory
                    crosses the 50GB mark.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While performance isn't the 3D5000's strong suit, security
                    is. The 32-core processor allegedly has a custom-made
                    mechanism to defend against vulnerabilities such as
                    <a

                      >Meltdown or Spectre</a
                    >. The chip also has its Trusted Platform Module (TPM), so
                    it doesn't rely on an external solution. In addition,
                    according to MyDrivers' report, the 3D5000 also supports a
                    secret national algorithm with an embedded security module
                    that seemingly delivers excellent encryption and decryption
                    efficiency higher than 5 Gbps.

                    But many bitcoiners dispute the characterization of the
                    network as energy-guzzling and carbon intensive, saying that
                    mining is increasingly powered by renewable energy. And,
                    they say, PoS is inferior to PoW—prone to centralization
                    (crypto's great nemesis), concentrating influence and wealth
                    in the hands of the wealthy, without any mitigating forces,
                    like energy costs, pulling in the opposite direction. All of
                    this makes Shanghai a proxy battle over the future of
                    crypto.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to de Vries, it would be perfectly possible,
                    from a technical perspective, for Bitcoin to follow in the
                    footsteps of the Ethereum network. "Bitcoin could move to
                    PoS, no problem," he says. "But it's a social challenge."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The impasse is worsened by the ideological opposition
                    to PoS among bitcoiners, separate from the environmental
                    considerations. Some find unthinkable the idea of tampering
                    with Satoshi Nakamoto's original invention, and others, like
                    Bendiksen and Pritzker, believe PoS introduces greater risk
                    of centralization and censorship—and therefore represents a
                    threat to crypto's founding principles. "PoS is essentially
                    the fiat system," says Pritzker, "because whoever has the
                    gold makes the rules." For this reason, explains Bendiksen,
                    bitcoiners will "never agree" to a shift.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Any attack on bitcoin is an attack on their morality,
                    values, and often their net worth. This makes everything
                    feel personal," Von Wong told WIRED. "Because most people
                    don't see themselves as intrinsically bad, they feel
                    misjudged and misunderstood, which is a terrible place to
                    start a conversation."

                    JUICE is scheduled to perform 35 Jovian moon flybys, but the

                    estimated six months and come as close as 311 miles (500 km)
                    to its surface. By doing so, "Juice will be the first

                    When the team looked at data obtained shortly after the 2021
                    storm outbreak, they noticed a signal in northeastern
                    Arkansas. The feature was consistent with a roughly
                    60-kilometer-long track of wet soil. Tornadoes had been
                    previously reported in that area — outside the city of
                    Osceola — so it's likely that this feature was created by a
                    powerful storm, the team concluded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That makes sense, Kingfield says, and observations like
                    these can reveal tornado signatures that might otherwise be
                    missed. However, it's important to acknowledge that this new
                    technique works best in places where soils are capable of
                    retaining water, he says. "You need to have clay-rich
                    soils."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even so, these results hold promise for analyzing other
                    tornadoes, Kingfield says. It's always useful to have a new
                    tool for estimating the strength, path and structure of a
                    storm, but many storms go relatively unexamined simply
                    because of where and when they occur, he says. "Now we have
                    this new ground truth."

                    Of course, for the main intended purpose, 100baseT isn't
                    exactly a limitation here. Typical uses of the RUT-240
                    involve connecting it to an existing wired internet
                    connection via the WAN socket and passing that through to
                    another device connected to the LAN side, with the
                    possibility of routing traffic via 4G LTE if the wired WAN
                    connectivity fails. In these cases, even if the connection
                    between the existing devices was syncing at 1000baseT, (or
                    beyond), then unless our actual internet connection can
                    provide bandwidth in excess of 100 mbit then we don't really
                    lose anything in terms of raw speed. Technically, latency
                    might be worse, but the difference will be so small as to be
                    lost in the noise compared to the extra latency created by
                    the packet processing of the RUT-240.

                    The atmosphere thickened enough that it affected the newly
                    launched Starlink stations. They started to experience
                    atmospheric drag, which caused them to deorbit and burn up
                    on the way down. It was an expensive lesson in space weather
                    and provided people on Earth with a great view of what
                    happens when satellites fall back to Earth. It was also that
                    could have been avoided if they'd delayed their launch to
                    account for the ongoing threat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The loss of the Starlink satellites cost the company
                    millions of dollars. The company elected to launch, even
                    though the space weather community warned about the effects
                    of a geomagnetic storm. For years now, solar physicists have
                    been warning about the effects of space weather. Most
                    satellite companies pay attention to reports from such
                    places as the Space Weather Prediction Center. If they get
                    enough warning ahead of time, they can take steps to protect
                    their equipment. Astronauts on the ISS can take shelter
                    until the storm passes. And, power companies and others can
                    follow forecasts of such storms so they can take whatever
                    action is needed in the event of a strong event.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Solar physicists continue to study these solar outbursts in
                    hopes of coming up with a foolproof prediction system. At
                    the moment, when something erupts from the Sun, we get
                    notifications from a fleet of satellites. Those give us
                    minutes to hours of "heads-up" time to prepare for the
                    worst. NASA and other agencies continue to improve solar
                    studies and prediction methods so that companies launching
                    satellites to low-Earth orbit can take steps to protect
                    their investments.

                    jail. We got an approval recently, which was confirmed on
                    March 21st with a number, an official number, for myself and
                    my colleague, Rebecca Vincent, and we were invited to come
                    to the prison.

                    And when we just arrived, the guy at the desk, when he saw
                    my passport, he suddenly was very stressed, and that taking
                    a paper on his office — on his desk, and that read it,
                    saying, "According to Article" — I do not remember the
                    number of the article, but according to this article, "you
                    are not allowed to visit Julian Assange. This is a decision
                    that has been made by the governor of the Belmarsh prison,
                    based on intelligence that we had" — I quote him — "that you

                    personally, I've been a journalist since 1996, and we were
                    vetted, so it was never a mystery that I was a journalist,
                    never a secret. Second, my colleague wasn't a journalist
                    herself. And we came here not as journalists, but as
                    representatives of an international NGO with a constitutive
                    status in many international organizations. So it was really
                    as Reporters Without Borders representatives, not as
                    reporters covering the case. So, it doesn't make sense for
                    this second reason. And there is a third reason for which it
                    doesn't make sense, is that already two journalists, at
                    least, have been able to visit him in jail in the past four
                    years. So —

                    Attendees also wanted to know whether the sensors could
                    track how often they came into their offices and at what
                    time. "I'm in office [X]," Widder said. "The Mite knows that
                    it's recording something from office [X], and therefore
                    identifies me as an occupant of the office." Agarwal
                    responded that none of the analysis on the raw data would
                    attempt to match that data with specific people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At one point, Agarwal also mentioned that he had gotten
                    buy-in on the idea of using Mites sensors to monitor
                    cleaning staff—which some people in the audience interpreted
                    as facilitating algorithmic surveillance or, at the very
                    least, clearly demonstrating the unequal power dynamics at
                    play.

                    A sensor system that could be used to surveil workers
                    concerned Jay Aronson, a professor of science, technology,
                    and society in the history department and the founder of the
                    Center for Human Rights Science, who became aware of Mites
                    after Widder brought the project to his attention.
                    University staff like administrative and facilities workers
                    are more likely to be negatively impacted and less likely to
                    reap any benefits, said Aronson. "The harms and the benefits
                    are not equally distributed," he added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similarly, students and nontenured faculty seemingly had
                    very little to directly gain from the Mites project and
                    faced potential repercussions both from the data collection
                    itself and, they feared, from speaking up against it. We
                    spoke with five students in addition to Widder who felt
                    uncomfortable both with the research project and with
                    voicing their concerns.

                    [...] Because structural color can blanket an entire surface
                    with just a thin, ultralight layer, Chanda thinks this will
                    be a game changer—for airlines. A Boeing 747 needs about 500
                    kilograms of paint. He estimates that his paint could cover
                    the same area with 1.3 kilograms. That's more than 1,000
                    pounds shaved off each plane, which would reduce how much
                    fuel is needed per journey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Structural paint may also last longer. (Some airlines
                    repaint planes <a
                      href="https://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_05/textonly/fo01txt.html"
                      >every four years</a
                    >.) Pigment molecules break down in sunlight but structural
                    color doesn't—so it doesn't fade. "We have all these ways of
                    trying to fix pigment, to try to prevent it from oxidizing
                    and losing its color. Or it fades and we throw it in the
                    landfill," says Baumeister, who is also a cofounder of
                    consultancy <a href="https://biomimicry.net/who-we-are/"
                      >Biomimicry 3.8</a
                    >. "But when you need color to last forever—for the life of
                    the organism—structural color is preferred."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chanda's team also realized that, unlike conventional paint,
                    structural paint doesn't absorb infrared radiation, so it
                    doesn't trap heat. ("That's the reason your car gets hot in
                    the hot sun," he says.) The new paint is inherently <em
                      >cooling</em
                    >
                    in comparison: Based on the lab's preliminary experiments,
                    it can keep surfaces 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than
                    conventional paint.

                    The most surprising finding that emerged from the data was
                    the wide range of germline mutation rates. When the
                    researchers measured how often the mutations occurred per
                    generation, the species varied by only about fortyfold,
                    which Bergeron said seemed quite small compared to the
                    differences in body size, longevity and other traits. But
                    when they looked at the mutation rates per year rather than
                    per generation, the range increased to about 120-fold, which
                    was larger than previous studies had suggested.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study authors found that the higher the average
                    effective population size for a species, the lower its
                    mutation rate. That provided good evidence for the "<a
                      href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2010.05.003"
                      >drift-barrier hypothesis</a
                    >," which Lynch devised a little over a decade ago.
                    "Selection is relentlessly trying to reduce the mutation
                    rate because most mutations are deleterious," Lynch
                    explained. But in species with smaller effective population
                    sizes, natural selection gets weaker because genetic drift —
                    the effect of pure chance on the spread of a mutation — gets
                    stronger. That allows the mutation rate to rise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings also support another idea in the scientific
                    literature, the
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0959-437x(02)00354-4"
                      >male-driven evolution hypothesis</a
                    >, which proposes that males may contribute more mutations
                    to the evolution of some species than females do. Bergeron
                    and her colleagues found that germline mutation rates tended
                    to be higher for males than for females — at least in
                    mammals and birds, though not in reptiles and fish.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The authors noted a possible reason for those differences:
                    Because males in all species copy their DNA constantly to
                    make sperm, they face endless opportunities for mutations to
                    occur. Female fish and reptiles make eggs throughout their
                    lifetimes too, so they run a similar risk of genetic error.
                    But female mammals and birds are essentially born with all
                    the egg cells they will ever produce, so their germlines are
                    more protected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Harris commended the findings as an exciting start to
                    answering some of these big questions about what factors are
                    the most important determiners of mutation rate and thus
                    evolution. Beyond that, the study hints at just how much
                    biodiversity exists in nature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The diversity of life isn't just what animals look like,"
                    she said. There are "all these traits that you can't see,
                    and being able to observe it in studies like this just makes
                    biodiversity even more exciting."

                    from Meta, SAM is an image segmentation model that can
                    respond to text prompts or user clicks to isolate specific
                    objects within an image. Image segmentation is a process in
                    computer vision that involves dividing an image into
                    multiple segments or regions, each representing a specific
                    object or area of interest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The purpose of image segmentation is to make an image easier
                    to analyze or process. Meta also sees the technology as
                    being useful for understanding webpage content, augmented
                    reality applications, image editing, and aiding scientific
                    study by automatically localizing animals or objects to
                    track on video.

                    people are still suffering from long Covid, the mysterious
                    cocktail of symptoms that persist in some patients more than
                    12 weeks after an initial infection. Researchers are still
                    working to understand this illness, but it's been slow
                    progress so far.

                  <p>
                    This is because long Covid is not just a medical
                    problem—it's also a data problem, says Indra Joshi, director
                    of health, research, and artificial intelligence at
                    Palantir, which specializes in analyzing big data.

                  <p>
                    Before the pandemic, US hospitals kept their data to
                    themselves, Joshi told WIRED Health this March, making it
                    difficult for policymakers and researchers to identify
                    patterns of disease occurring across the country. That's why
                    Palantir worked with the US medical research agency, the
                    National Institutes of Health, to create what Joshi

                    enclave," says Joshi, explaining that N3C now includes 2.1
                    billion clinical observations. The data enclave also
                    encourages clinicians to enter data in a standardized
                    format, making it easy for their insights to be compared
                    with data collected from other US hospitals.

                    By harmonizing all this data, the N3C acts as a collective
                    pool of information that researchers can dip into to try to
                    find consensus on the ongoing mysteries of long Covid: What
                    exactly are the symptoms? What treatments are people
                    receiving? And how are they responding to those treatments?

                    While programmers today take division for granted, most
                    microprocessors in the 1970s could only add and subtract —
                    division required a slow and tedious loop implemented in
                    assembly code. One of the nice features of the Intel 8086
                    processor (1978) was that it provided machine instructions
                    for integer multiplication and division. Internally, the
                    8086 still performed a loop, but the loop was implemented in
                    microcode: faster and transparent to the programmer. Even
                    so, division was a slow operation, about 50 times slower
                    than addition.

                  <p>
                    I recently examined multiplication in the 8086, and now it's
                    time to look at the division microcode.1 (There's a lot of
                    overlap with the multiplication post so apologies for any
                    deja vu.)

                    TEMPO is not the first spacecraft to look at air quality.
                    NASA and NOAA already have multiple instruments in orbit
                    that gather pollution-related measurements. The difference
                    though, according to multiple NASA-affiliated researchers,
                    is that these other tools are trapped in low Earth orbit,
                    where they're limited. At LEO, other devices like the
                    <a href="https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/omi.html"

                    can only capture one air quality reading per day per
                    location—and those readings come at a fixed time, which is a
                    big deficiency. Air quality fluctuates a lot throughout the
                    day (just think of the difference in polluting emissions
                    being pumped out during morning rush hour on a major highway
                    versus the early afternoon). Plus, these other devices tend
                    to capture their readings at a lower resolution, about 100
                    square miles, said

                    much longer lifetime as its host satellite is expected to
                    last for 15 or more years. Plus, TEMPO was built for the

                    Assuming all goes well with this week's launch, the

                    June and begin its commissioning process after the
                    commercial satellite is set up. NASA expects it to begin
                    transmitting usable data beginning in October, which will be
                    verified and made publicly available starting about April

                    [...] To be fair, there are places where this would be old
                    news. Phages pervade the natural world: There are possibly
                    trillions of them distributed through every niche of the
                    environment, each tuned by evolution to kill just one type
                    of bacteria. And there are countries where doctors have been
                    using them for decades. After World War I and a decade
                    before the first recognition of antibiotics, a self-taught
                    microbiologist named Félix d'Hérelle harnessed phages'
                    natural killing ability to cure dysentery in several
                    children in Paris. By the 1930s, he had found a research
                    home in what's now the Republic of Georgia. After Stalinism
                    closed the USSR off from Western Europe and the US, phage
                    research quietly flourished there.

                    It wasn't until the USSR collapsed in 1991 that phage
                    treatments came to the attention of countries with big

                    calls drug resistance a "silent pandemic" that could kill 10

                    problems that beset antibiotics. They each kill only one
                    type of bacteria, so they are less likely to disrupt
                    microbiomes. They penetrate complex matrices that defeat
                    antibiotics—not just the thick mucus caused by cystic
                    fibrosis, but the thin films of organisms that develop on
                    pacemakers and artificial joints. And they are unthinkably

                    Australia's top spy agency has added to growing concerns
                    about a popular social media app, and its collection of
                    users' personal data. State governments across the nation
                    are issuing TikTok bans on official work devices as concerns
                    about data safety increase worldwide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The app's Australian general manager Lee Hunter recently
                    told The Project that users should feel "safe" on TikTok,
                    and claimed China had no way of accessing data – despite the
                    site's parent company operating out of China.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, national intelligence organisation Australian
                    Signals Directorate (ASD) recently released advice about the
                    app, warning the general public not to use it on a device
                    that can access other information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Do not use it on a phone that can access any official
                    information, for example, any workplace communication (email
                    clients, MS Teams)," the ASD warned in advice shared by the
                    Tasmanian government.

                    several months back. Parent company Monument confirmed not
                    only the data breach but that the companies shared private
                    information with advertisers via a notification filed with
                    California's attorney general. Data shared with advertisers,
                    without user consent, includes patient names, dates of
                    birth, email addresses, postal addresses, phone numbers,

                    [...] The companies blame third-party tracking systems for
                    the issue, stating that they have removed the offending
                    tracking codes from their websites. The companies do not
                    admit to sharing this information on purpose to increase
                    profits, indicating that the tracking pixels provided by

                    [...] Though this is an especially egregious example, it is
                    important to remember that most companies have a
                    less-than-pristine record regarding data privacy, even in

                    are the new way to gain unauthorized access to a vehicle.
                    Now, however, it seems that attackers have found a new way
                    to entirely bypass the electronic security on modern cars: A
                    method called CAN injection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The attack relies on a vehicle's CAN bus, the internal
                    computer network that keeps everything running. If you've
                    ever wondered how your car's engine, body control module,
                    and all the little controllers scattered around the car all
                    communicate, CAN bus is the answer. The system is universal
                    in modern cars, and even aftermarket ECU manufacturers now

                  <p>
                    The attack method Tindell lays out relies on physical access
                    to the car's CAN bus, meaning an attacker needs to get to
                    the data wires that run through your car. By tapping into
                    these wires, a thief can inject malicious commands into the
                    network — allowing the thief to wake up the car's computer
                    controllers, falsify the presence of the car key, and drive
                    off. [...]

                  <p>
                    [...] This attack isn't the easiest to pull off, given that
                    it requires a thief to partially disassemble the target car,
                    but it's powerful when done correctly — entirely bypassing
                    the car's key, unlike relay attacks that simply extend the
                    key's radio range.

                    A team of physicists has recreated a classic experiment in
                    particle physics with a dimensional twist, by performing it
                    in time instead of just space. In the process, they
                    showcased the utility of a unique material for future
                    experiments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers redesigned the double-slit experiment, which
                    was first performed in 1801 and demonstrated a curious trait
                    of light: that it can behave both as a particle and a wave.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The original experiment tested how light moved through
                    space; the recent rendition tested how light would travel if
                    it was only allowed to at specific times. Details of the
                    team's work are
                    <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41567-023-01993-w"
                      >published</a
                    >
                    today in <em>Nature Physics</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the traditional experiment, a beam of light is
                    projected at a barrier, behind which is a photosensitive
                    detector. The barrier has two parallel slits. If you threw
                    ordinary matter at the barrier, they would roughly form the
                    same shape as the slits on the detector. But when light is
                    cast on the slits, it splits into two waves that pass
                    through the barrier and intersect on the other side.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the new work, the researchers made one big change:
                    They swapped out an ordinary screen with two slits for an
                    indium-tin-oxide film—the same material that is used in
                    modern phone screens. (It's actually a metamaterial, or a
                    material not found in nature, that is
                    <a
                      href="https://gizmodo.com/new-noise-blocking-material-could-make-jets-and-drones-1833229326"
                      >engineered to behave a certain way</a
                    >.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers changed the reflectance of the screen using
                    ultrafast lasers, which only allowed light through at
                    specific times, quadrillionths of a second apart. Basically,
                    they built a quantum tollbooth, using the lasers to create
                    time-dependent slits in the barrier. Even when they only
                    allowed one photon through the screen, the light produced an
                    interference pattern.

                    Samsung Electronics Co. said it's cutting memory chip
                    production after reporting its slimmest profit since the
                    2009 financial crisis, a significant step toward ending a
                    supply glut that had cratered prices across the industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Operating profit at the world's largest maker of
                    memory chips plunged more than 95% to 600 billion won ($450
                    million) for the three months ended March, missing the
                    average analyst estimate of 1.4 trillion won. Sales fell 19%
                    to 63 trillion won.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] South Korea's largest company had resisted pulling
                    back despite the downturn, in part to grab market share from
                    rivals SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology Inc., which have
                    been forced to cut output.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Samsung's shares rose as much as 4.7% in the highest
                    intraday jump in three months. Hynix shares surged as much
                    as 6.7%. [...] The company had warned that earnings would
                    fall in the first quarter on slowing sales. But memory
                    prices tumbled more than anticipated because of sluggish
                    demand for a wide range of electronics from smartphones to
                    PCs, as consumers and companies navigated recession risks.
                    Despite its post-Covid re-opening, China's market has also
                    not bounced back as quickly as some anticipated. Samsung is
                    estimated to have lost about $3 billion in its memory chip
                    division.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Prices of DRAM - a type of memory used to process data
                    - are expected to fall in the current quarter by around 10%,
                    according to Yuanta's Baik. That follows a roughly 20% slide
                    in the previous three months and a more than 30% drop in the
                    fourth quarter of last year. [...] Inventory at Samsung had
                    swelled to 52.2 trillion won at the end of last year after
                    the company maintained production despite a collapse in
                    demand. The existing high inventory will take time to
                    digest, said TrendForce Senior Vice President Avril Wu.
                    "Slower-than-expected demand in the second half of 2023 will
                    prolong the time required for inventory to get back to
                    normal levels."

                    As the article in the Guardian goes on to explain, the

                    many offshoots is large and flourishing. The lawsuit itself

                    mixes and collections that testify to the vitality and range
                    of the music that has emerged over the last few decades. To
                    claim "ownership" of the very simple rhythmic patterns that
                    are used is as absurd as claiming ownership of the

                    If successful, the court case will have a devastating effect
                    on dembo and raggaeton culture, since many of today's and
                    tomorrow's artists will doubtless prefer to move on to other
                    styles rather than pay a dembo tax to use something as basic
                    as a rhythm. A couple of musicians may win a few extra
                    dollars, but there will be millions of losers in the form of
                    fans of this music, who will have less of the style they
                    love available to them.[...]

                    Scientists tend to look at the size and shape of the
                    structures, and which genes their cells express, to work out
                    how similar they are to typical embryos. But there are other
                    important aspects to consider.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We first need to agree on what an embryo is," says Naomi
                    Moris, a developmental biologist at the Crick Institute in
                    London. "Is it the thing that is only generated from the
                    fusion of a sperm and an egg? Is it something to do with the
                    cell types it possesses, or the [shape] of the structure?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps it's more to do with the structure's potential. A
                    human embryo could go on to form a person. Human blastoids
                    can't develop into people. Yet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the technology advances, it is looking increasingly
                    likely that one day, stem-cell-derived embryos will be able
                    to develop into living animals. "Theoretically, if you have
                    all the right cell types ... they could go further," says
                    Rossant. "Never say never."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However we define blastoids and other embryo-like
                    structures, now is the time to start regulating how we grow
                    and study them. Rossant is one of the many scientists I
                    spoke to who agree that, given how embryo-like these
                    structures are looking, they should probably be subject to
                    the same rules and regulations that cover research on normal
                    embryos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The big risk is ... if we had one rogue player that went
                    really fast [with human cells], and developed something that
                    caused a public backlash," says Moris.

                  <p>
                    At CES 2023, AMD announced its Phoenix-HS APUs featuring Zen
                    4 CPUs and RDNA 3 iGPUs. The company is expected to follow
                    that with the 'Strix Point' APUs, sporting Zen 5 CPUs and
                    RDNA 3+ iGPUs. According to AMD's official roadmap, the
                    Strix Point chips will launch sometime in 2024, although the
                    exact ETA remains a mystery for now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Almost a year after AMD officially teased its 'Strix Point'
                    APUs, popular YouTube channel RedGamingTech has
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYxR1OKLQ5c"
                      >shared</a
                    >
                    many interesting details about the upcoming hardware.
                    According to the video, the flagship Strix Point APU will
                    come with 16 cores, including 8 big Zen 5 and 8 smaller Zen
                    4D cores, alongside 32MB of L3 cache.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the graphics side, the chip is expected to feature an
                    RDNA 3+ iGPU with 8 Work Group Processors (WGP). The video
                    also suggests that the iGPU on the most powerful Strix Point
                    APU would have clock speeds of more than 3GHz.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the reported specs hold up, it would be a little
                    disappointing, as an earlier video from the channel claimed
                    that Strix Point's RDNA 3+ iGPU could have 12 WGP/24 Compute
                    Units (CU) with around 9 TFLOPS of FP32 precision
                    performance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, the mid-range Strix Point SKU will reportedly
                    have 4x Zen 5 and 8x Zen 4D cores, paired with 16MB of L3
                    cache and 4 RDNA 3+ WGPs. Finally, the entry-level chip is
                    said to come with up to 6 cores, including 2x Zen 5 and 4x
                    Zen 4D. They are also tipped to have 8 MB of L3 cache and a
                    2 WGP iGPU.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The core count, cache and WGPs will not be the only
                    differences between the high-end and entry-level Strix Point
                    APUs. As per the video, the top-end chip in the lineup will
                    be fabricated using TSMC's 3 nm process, while the other two
                    SKUs will use the 4 nm process. The chips are also expected
                    to have a powerful memory controller with support for
                    DDR5-6400 or LPDDR5X-8533 RAM.

                    One night last week, the law professor Jonathan Turley got a
                    troubling email. As part of a research study, a fellow
                    lawyer in California had asked the AI chatbot ChatGPT to
                    generate a list of legal scholars who had sexually harassed
                    someone. Turley's name was on the list.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The chatbot, created by OpenAI, said Turley had made
                    sexually suggestive comments and attempted to touch a
                    student while on a class trip to Alaska, citing a March 2018
                    article in The Washington Post as the source of the
                    information. The problem: No such article existed. There had
                    never been a class trip to Alaska. And Turley said he'd
                    never been accused of harassing a student.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A regular commentator in the media, Turley had sometimes
                    asked for corrections in news stories. But this time, there
                    was no journalist or editor to call — and no way to correct
                    the record.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It was quite chilling," he said in an interview with The
                    Post. "An allegation of this kind is incredibly harmful."

                    summarization, factual retrieval, creative writing, and
                    coding. For each test, we fed the exact same instruction
                    (called a "prompt") into ChatGPT (with GPT-4) and Google
                    Bard. We used the first result, with no cherry-picking.
                    Obviously, this is not a scientific study and is intended to
                    be a fun comparison of the chatbots' capabilities. Outputs
                    can vary between sessions due to random elements, and
                    further evaluations with different prompts will produce
                    different results. Also, the capabilities of these models
                    will change rapidly over time as Google and OpenAI continue
                    to upgrade them. But for now, this is how things stand in

                    This battle over [copyright] moves to adopt an open-ended
                    fair dealing based on the US approach, rather than one with
                    a limited list of permitted exceptions and limitations, is
                    an important one that is happening all around the world.
                    Open-ended fair use is clearly more helpful for dealing with
                    developments in technology that were never envisaged when
                    old copyright laws were drawn up. They allow at least a
                    basic flexibility in the way that copyright is applied, for
                    example online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once again, the current resistance to countries adopting
                    fair use or open norms is the result of the copyright
                    industry refusing to allow any legal developments that
                    favour the public or indeed anyone except themselves. A good
                    example of the fierce battles being fought is South Africa,
                    where President Ramaphosa sent the Copyright Amendment Bill
                    back to Parliament after it was passed, largely because of
                    lobbying by copyright supporters against its fair use
                    provisions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nigeria's new law is important because the country is
                    already a leader in Africa, and is predicted to become one
                    of the world's top economies. What happens in Nigeria
                    matters, because it sets an important precedent for other
                    rising nations looking to update their outdated copyright
                    laws to maximise the benefits of the digital world by
                    adopting open norms.

                    [...] "One of the reasons desalination is so expensive is
                    that it's energy-intensive—it's one of the most
                    energy-intensive water supply options that we have," said
                    Heather Cooley, director of research at the Pacific
                    Institute. "In the places where we've seen people build it,
                    we do see the rates go up. There are cheaper options that
                    have fewer environmental impacts and impacts on
                    communities."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Communities could also do a lot more with efficiency
                    measures and figure out ways to reduce the current amount of
                    water they consume. "It's not uncommon to see emerald green
                    lawns that are irrigated poorly," said Cooley. "If you look
                    at our urban water use in California, half is for
                    landscapes. There's a lot of doom and gloom around drought
                    and around climate change and water use, but we have
                    significant opportunities to be doing better than how we've
                    been doing."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As the world gets drier, there's no question that
                    ocean desalination can fit into our water future. But
                    tapping into the seemingly endless supply of the ocean is
                    more complex than it looks at first blush. The promise of
                    desalination is understandably alluring, but a focus on it
                    while ignoring simpler solutions shows how some see climate
                    change as a problem to be solved with technology, rather
                    than finding ways to fix broken systems and to make do with
                    less. Real, sustainable change comes from making the harder,
                    systemic fixes first—not chasing after expensive technology.

                  <p>
                    "We need to do the cheaper things first," Cooley said. "We
                    don't know what the future holds. And the things we're
                    talking about doing are consistent with a good quality of
                    life—it's just about using less water."

                    By around 3,000 years ago, visitors at Es Càrritx cave on
                    Menorca — perhaps shamans who performed spiritual and
                    healing rituals — consumed plants containing mind-altering
                    and vision-inducing substances, say archaeologist Elisa
                    Guerra-Doce of the University of Valladolid in Spain and
                    colleagues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Signs of human activity at the cave, including more than 200
                    human graves arrayed in a chamber at the entrance, were
                    previously dated to between around 3,600 and 2,800 years
                    ago. Researchers had also found a hoard of objects in a
                    small pit within an inner cave chamber, including six wooden
                    containers, each containing locks of human hair.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chemical analyses of one container's locks, possibly from
                    more than one person, detected three psychoactive plant
                    substances that had been ingested and absorbed into the hair
                    over nearly a year, the scientists report April 6 in
                    <em>Scientific Reports</em>.

                    Two substances, atropine and scopolamine from nightshade
                    plants, induce disorientation, hallucinations and altered
                    physical sensations. Another, ephedrine, boosts energy and
                    alertness. Shamans would have known how to handle and
                    consume these potentially toxic plants safely, the
                    investigators say.

                    counted. Planetary scientists Rebecca Hahn and Paul Byrne of

                    Such a thorough inventory of volcanism on Venus could offer
                    clues about the planet's interior, such as hot spots of
                    magma production, Byrne says. And with the recent discovery

                    Almost all the volcanoes that Hahn and Byrne found are less
                    than 5 kilometers wide. About 700 are 5 to 100 kilometers
                    across, and about 100 are wider than 100 kilometers. The
                    team also found many tight clusters of small volcanoes
                    called volcanic fields.

                    Sébastien Guillet, an environmental scientist at the
                    University of Geneva in Switzerland, was rocking out to Pink
                    Floyd's classic Dark Side of the Moon album one day when he
                    made a prescient connection. The darkest lunar eclipses all
                    occurred within a year or so of major volcanic eruptions.
                    And astronomers know the exact days of those eclipses. So
                    medieval historical accounts of lunar eclipse sightings
                    should be able to help scientists narrow down the time frame
                    in which major eruptions occurred during the High Medieval
                    period spanning 1100 to 1300 CE. Guillet collaborated with
                    several other scientists to conduct such a study, combining
                    textual analysis with tree ring and ice core data. They
                    described their findings in a

                    "Climate scientists usually identify past volcanic eruptions
                    by measuring the acidity and amount of volcanic ash in cores
                    drilled from polar ice, or by inferring abrupt temperature
                    changes in tree ring records," Andrea Seim (University of
                    Freiburg) and Eduardo Zorita (Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon)
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00850-3"

                    >. "However, these sources sometimes disagree, because the
                    location, intensity, and timing of eruptions can produce
                    varying results, as can circulation of the atmosphere.
                    Guillet and colleagues' approach offers an independent—and
                    perhaps even more direct—source of information about the
                    timing of volcanic eruptions, which could resolve some of
                    these disagreements."<br />[...]<br />Guillet's critical
                    insight stems from the impact volcanic eruptions can have on
                    the appearance of a lunar eclipse. If there are a lot of
                    aerosols, the moon will appear dark during the eclipse; if
                    aerosols are scarce, the moon will have a bright reddish
                    appearance. So one should be able to estimate how much
                    volcanic aerosols were in the atmosphere from medieval
                    descriptions of the color and luminosity of the moon during
                    lunar eclipses, and use that information to more accurately
                    date medieval volcanic eruptions.

                It's an interesting combination of science and analysis of
                historical writings to arrive at a better understanding of some

                    The federal government has recently begun addressing these
                    dangers. Lawmakers are introducing bills and spotlighting
                    the issue at hearings, and a presidential directive has
                    spawned a series of reports and reviews. To the people most
                    informed and worried about the chaos that hackers could
                    cause, these developments are long overdue.

                    American security," says US congressman August Pfluger, a
                    Texas Republican who has sponsored a bill on the subject.

                    Precision agriculture uses GPS sensors and satellite imagery
                    to determine the right kind of fertilizer for every patch of
                    soil and send instructions directly to tractors that
                    automatically move around and spray the appropriate mixes.
                    If hackers breached these systems, they could poison the
                    crops of every farmer using them. The impact wouldn't be
                    clear until months later, when the crops would begin to grow
                    poorly or fail to grow at all.

                    America's meat supply faces huge risks too. Inside the
                    massive industrial facilities where most chickens are raised
                    and slaughtered, the temperature and humidity are precisely
                    controlled by internet-connected computers. With control of
                    this system, hackers could engineer a catastrophe.

                    can force farmers to sit out planting seasons. Breaches at
                    meat-packing plants can cause destabilizing supply
                    shortages. Tampering at a food processing firm can lead to
                    deadly contamination. Already, ransomware attacks that have
                    forced companies to shut down operations for a week have
                    left schools without milk, juice, and eggs, according to
                    Sachs.

                    "A major disruption in this sector leads to immediate public
                    health and safety issues," says Mark Montgomery, who served
                    as executive director of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission.

                    Despite being increasingly vulnerable, Sachs says, the food
                    and agriculture sector still "doesn't really understand the
                    threat mindset" as well as higher-profile sectors, like
                    financial services and energy, do.

                    Nodules form naturally over millions of years as trace
                    elements in seawater get deposited onto small objects
                    nestled together on the ocean floor, like bone fragments or
                    shark teeth, and slowly grow. They contain manganese,
                    cobalt, copper, and nickel, which are all used in the
                    lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles today, as
                    well as a bit of iron and titanium and trace amounts of
                    rare-earth metals and lithium.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because of the impressive array of metals they contain, at
                    least one company has likened each nodule to a battery in a
                    rock. That's why over the past decade, companies have begun
                    to explore the possibility of commercial mining operations
                    in the deep sea, mostly in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.

                    octopuses, not to mention all the tiny creatures we haven't
                    discovered yet. Scientists have also raised questions about
                    what will happen when the mining operations kick up
                    sediment: plumes could disturb wildlife or even the natural
                    carbon storage beneath the seabed.

                    Governing international waters is a complicated business.
                    For deep-sea mining, there's a UN group in charge, called
                    the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which was founded
                    in 1994 and is based in Jamaica. The ISA has been developing
                    a mining code for commercial operations, but some companies
                    want to get things going already.

                    Chinese company Space Pioneer established a pair of
                    milestones this past Sunday, becoming the first startup to
                    successfully reach orbit on its first attempt, and the first
                    Chinese company to reach orbit with liquid rocket
                    propulsion.

                    Space Pioneer launched its Tianlong-2 from the Jiuquan
                    launch centre in northwest China at 4:48 a.m. ET on April 2,
                    according to

                    The company, officially known as Beijing Tianbing Technology
                    Co., is the first in China to fly a rocket using liquid
                    propellant. Tianlong-2 uses liquid oxygen kerosene rather
                    than solid propellant made from fuel and oxidizer, which
                    allows for more control of the thrust magnitude and is
                    better suited for reusability.

                    launch of Tianlong-3, a larger liquid propellant rocket
                    that's designed with a reusable first stage similar to
                    SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket. The upcoming rocket will be
                    capable of carrying 15 tons of payload to low Earth orbit,
                    and it's hoping to launch up to 60 satellites for China's

                    The researcher estimates that more than 40,000 devices,
                    located in residential and commercial properties, are
                    impacted and more than 20,000 individuals have active Nexx
                    accounts [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Researcher Sam Sabetan found that devices use the same
                    password to communicate with the Nexx cloud. What's more,
                    this password is easily attainable simply by analyzing the
                    firmware shipped with the device or the back-and-forth
                    communication between a device and the Nexx cloud.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Using a universal password for all devices presents a
                    significant vulnerability, as unauthorized users can access
                    the entire ecosystem by obtaining the shared password," the
                    researcher wrote. "In doing so, they could compromise not
                    only the privacy but also the safety of Nexx's customers by
                    controlling their garage doors without their consent."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Sabetan used this password to access the server, he
                    quickly found not only communications between his device and
                    the cloud but communications for other Nexx devices and the
                    cloud. That meant he could sift through the email addresses,
                    last names, first initials, and device IDs of other users to
                    identify customers based on unique information shared in
                    these messages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it gets worse still. Sabetan could copy messages other
                    users issued to open their doors and replay them at
                    will—from anywhere in the world. That meant a simple
                    cut-and-paste operation was enough to control any Nexx
                    device no matter where he or it was located.
