                  <p>
                    The US Commerce Department has promised to stop promoting
                    American-made commercial spyware to foreign governments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a letter sent to US Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), the federal
                    government dept finally provided details about the policies
                    adopted by its International Trade Administration (ITA)
                    intended to prevent any further promotion of US surveillance
                    technology overseas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For the first time the department is making clear that the
                    United States will not help companies find foreign markets
                    for products or services that undermine democracy or enable
                    repressive surveillance and discrimination," Wyden said in a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-successfully-presses-the-international-trade-administration-to-prevent-the-promotion-of-surveillance-technology-to-foreign-governments"
                      >statement</a
                    >. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ITA, which is part of the Commerce Department, promotes
                    American goods and services abroad. In May, Wyden sent a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/26/wyden_ita_spyware_policy/"
                      >letter</a
                    >
                    to US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo demanding answers
                    about its pushing of commercial spyware overseas. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Last year, the ITA confirmed to Senator Wyden that it
                    has encouraged foreign governments to buy this type of tech,
                    but it refused to answer the senator's questions about which
                    products it endorsed and in which markets. The Department of
                    Commerce still seems to be stonewalling on both, but more on
                    that later.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Promoting the use of surveillance tech and spyware
                    under the guise of 'advocating for US businesses' smacks
                    uncomfortably of eroding global human rights for a profit,"
                    Schroeder said. "The very nature of the technology makes it
                    impossible to promote use of spyware in a way that does not
                    threaten human rights values." 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While a review process is "helpful," the US has no business
                    exporting things like spyware and facial recognition tech,
                    and others, including advanced data analytics and automated
                    license plate readers, should be added to the list, she
                    said. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We've repeatedly seen this technology abused and, once
                    exported, the ITA and the US as a whole has very little
                    control over whether it will be abused or fall into the
                    hands of repressive regimes," Schroeder said.

                    Imagine a skin cream that heals damage occurring throughout
                    the day when your skin is exposed to sunlight or
                    environmental toxins. That's the potential of a synthetic,
                    biomimetic melanin developed by scientists at Northwestern
                    University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new study, the scientists show that their synthetic
                    melanin, mimicking the natural melanin in human skin, can be
                    applied topically to injured skin, where it accelerates
                    wound healing. These effects occur both in the skin itself
                    and systemically in the body.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When applied in a cream, the synthetic melanin can protect
                    skin from sun exposure and heals skin injured by sun damage
                    or chemical burns, the scientists said. The technology works
                    by scavenging free radicals, which are produced by injured
                    skin such as a sunburn. Left unchecked, free radical
                    activity damages cells and ultimately may result in skin
                    aging and skin cancer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study, titled "Topical Application of Synthetic Melanin
                    Promotes Tissue Repair," is published Nov. 2 in
                    <em>npj Regenerative Medicine</em>.

                  <p>
                    Melanin in humans and animals provides pigmentation to the
                    skin, eyes and hair. The substance protects your cells from
                    sun damage with increased pigmentation in response to
                    sunlight—a process commonly referred to as tanning. That
                    same pigment in your skin also naturally scavenges free
                    radicals in response to damaging environmental pollution
                    from industrial sources and automobile exhaust fumes.

                    The Space Force announced yesterday that X-37B Mission 7 is
                    scheduled to launch from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida,
                    on December 7, 2023. The spaceplane's first mission on a
                    Falcon Heavy rocket will be designated USSF-52 and it will
                    be run by the Space Force together with the Air Force Rapid

                    New research shows that a person's own behavior is the
                    primary driver of how they treat others during brief,
                    zero-sum-game competitions. Generous people tend to reward
                    generous behavior and selfish individuals often punish
                    generosity and reward selfishness – even when it costs them
                    personally. The study found that an individual's own
                    generous or selfish deeds carry more weight than the
                    attitudes and behaviors of others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Previous research into this arena of human behavior
                    suggested that social norms are the primary factor guiding a
                    person's decision-making in competitive scenarios, said Paul
                    Bogdan, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois
                    Urbana-Champaign who led the research in the Beckman
                    Institute for Advanced Science and Technology with U. of I.
                    psychology professors Florin Dolcos and Sanda Dolcos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The prevailing view before this study was that individuals
                    form expectations based on what they view as typical. If
                    everyone around me is selfish, then I'm going to learn to
                    accept selfishness and behave accordingly," Bogdan said.
                    "But we show that your judgments of other people's behavior
                    really depend on how you behave yourself."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Cultural norms toward self-interest or generosity do
                    influence people, as other studies have found, Florin Dolcos
                    said. "But we are not only observers. This study is showing
                    that we filter information about the world through our own
                    view."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those individuals whose behavior switched from generous to
                    selfish over time were more likely to punish generosity and
                    reward selfishness – but only after their own behavior
                    changed, the team found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This helps explain the phenomenon of social alignment, for
                    better and for worse, Florin Dolcos said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "You may have groups of selfish people who are more
                    accepting of other selfish people, and in order to be part
                    of that group, newcomers might display the same behavior,"
                    he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, the study finds that a person's own generous or
                    selfish nature drives their behavior in many arenas of life,
                    Sanda Dolcos said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is not just about decision-making," she said. "It has
                    practical relevance to many types of social interactions and
                    social evaluations."

                Former U.S. astronaut Frank Borman has died at the age of 95,
                NASA said on Thursday.

                He commanded the 1968 Apollo 8 mission that carried three
                astronauts farther from Earth than anyone had ever travelled.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm old enough to remember Apollo 8 (December 21–27, 1968, the
                first crewed spacecraft to leave low Earth orbit and the first
                human spaceflight to reach the Moon. The crew orbited the Moon
                ten times without landing, and then departed safely back to
                Earth. Three astronauts—Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William
                Anders—were the first humans to witness and photograph the far
                side of the Moon and an Earthrise.
              </p>
              <p>
                Born in Gary, Indiana, on March 14, 1928, he was the oldest
                American astronaut still living; that mantle now passes to Jim
                Lovell, who is also 95 but eleven days younger.

                    [...] This whole fiasco has been a complete failure of most
                    of the controls and protections Google has in place in
                    Android. The company slowly rolls out updates to stop
                    problems before it hits a wide number of users, but it
                    failed to pull the update when problems arose. Android has

                    so that you always have a backup if the device fails to boot
                    after an update, but that system didn't work here because
                    Google's "boot failure" detection isn't accurate enough. The
                    company shipped a quick-fix patch via Google Play System
                    Updates in the Play Store, but because those passively wait
                    around for a reboot to get applied, users still got hit by
                    the bug days after that patch came out. Android is

                    NEW YORK -- Omegle, a video chat service that connects users
                    with strangers at random, is shutting down after 14 years
                    following ample misuse of the platform — particularly the
                    sexual abuse of minors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a lengthy statement announcing the site's closure,
                    founder Leif K-Brooks reflected on how Omegle was meant to
                    connect people worldwide and "build on the things I loved
                    about the Internet." But, he added that a dark side of the
                    platform emerged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Virtually every tool can be used for good or for evil,"
                    Brooks wrote. "There can be no honest accounting of Omegle
                    without acknowledging that some people misused it, including
                    to commit unspeakably heinous crimes."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As of Thursday morning, the Omegle website remained
                    live with Brooks' statement, but its online video chat
                    function was no longer visible.

                    Store reviewer (Google doesn't provide links to reviews).
                    "This is very disturbing and on top of it, it moves my

                    So to use it I now have to first look at the ads, then
                    scroll down and hope to find my button." Another user
                    writes, "I don't want ads in an app that I have already paid
                    for the companion product." Other one-star reviews mention
                    things like, "I clicked door open/close event and it popped
                    up the video storage subscription dialog to ask me to

                    <em>Ah</em>, now it makes sense. Your garage door opener app
                    isn't here only to open your garage door; it's here to
                    display ads and upsell you on services. Using third-party

                    hardware-app-as-ad-platform strategy, so they are now
                    banned. Another part of this is probably the plug at the end
                    of Chamberlain's statement to "check out our authorized
                    partners," which includes companies like Amazon and

                Astronomers have discovered evidence of a theorized type of
                black hole lurking in the distant universe. Known as an "Outsize
                Black Hole," this object could help explain some fundamental
                cosmic mysteries, including how supermassive monsters form.
              </p>
              <p>
                Black holes as we know them tend to fall into two categories:
                there's the stellar mass black holes, which as the name suggests
                have masses equivalent to a few stars. They form when large
                stars die in a supernova. Up the other end of the scale sits
                supermassive black holes, which contain the mass of millions or
                even billions of stars. These are found at the center of many
                galaxies, including our own.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was long thought that supermassive black holes form by
                growing out of stellar mass black holes as they slurp up matter
                over billions of years. This hypothesis was seemingly bolstered
                by recent observations of intermediate mass black holes, rare
                objects that slot in the middle of the mass range.
              </p>
              <p>
                But as astronomers peer farther away in space and time, they've
                increasingly spotted signs that the story isn't that simple. In
                2017, a black hole with a mass of 800 million Suns was
                discovered in a distant corner of space that meant it grew that
                big just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang – a
                growth rate that should be impossible according to our models.
                And it's far from alone, with over 100 contemporary giants found
                since then.
              </p>
              <p>
                One possible explanation is that some black holes may form
                through other methods, giving them a larger starting mass than a
                regular old supernova would allow. If massive clouds of gas
                collapse, the hypothesis goes, they could form black holes with
                masses between about 10,000 and 100,000 Suns.
              </p>
              <p>
                "There are physical limits on how quickly black holes can grow
                once they've formed, but ones that are born more massive have a
                head start," said Andy Goulding, co-author of the study. "It's
                like planting a sapling, which takes less time to grow into a
                full-size tree than if you started with only a seed."
              </p>
              <p>
                Now astronomers claim to have discovered the first evidence for
                just such an object, which they call an Outsize Black Hole. It's
                located in a galaxy called UHZ1, at the incredible distance of
                13.2 billion light-years from Earth – which also means we're
                seeing it as it was 13.2 billion years ago, or less than 500
                million years after the Big Bang.

                Letters confiscated by Britain's Royal Navy before they reached
                French sailors during the Seven Years' War [(1756–1763)] have
                been opened for the first time.

                    The messages were seized by Britain's Royal Navy during the
                    Seven Years' War, taken to the Admiralty in London and never
                    opened. The collection is now held at the National Archives
                    in Kew.

                    "I only ordered the box out of curiosity," Morieux said.
                    "There were three piles of letters held together by ribbon.
                    The letters were very small and were sealed so I asked the
                    archivist if they could be opened and he did.

                So in the National Archive in Kew (UK) they found a box of
                letters sent during the seven years' war between France and the
                UK. Long lost correspondence.
              </p>

                Perhaps it's not that they are lost for 250ish years that is the
                interesting part. But how little things change. People still
                communicate about more or less the same things then as now, it's
                just the way we communicate that change for technological
                reasons.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nothing in there though if they tracked down the offspring,
                relatives etc of the letters and returned them to them. Guess
                that isn't a service offered.

                November 2, 1988 back when there were likely fewer than 100k
                systems connected to the Internet, though maybe even as few as
                60k. Some estimates suggest that around 1 out of 10 of those
                systems were infected, due to several holes in the target
                systems. Those which were infected ground to a halt due to a

                    those who lived through it. No major security incident had
                    ever occurred on such a scale before. The Worm was the top

                    concern by authorities in the days following the Worm's
                    deployment regarding its origin and purpose. It seeded
                    significant changes in law enforcement, defense funding and
                    planning, and how we all looked at interconnectivity. In the
                    following years, malware (and especially non-virus malware)

                From a seasonal cold to a stomach bug, nobody likes catching a
                virus—and epidemics can be devastating. We need safe,
                sustainable antiviral options to treat the outbreaks of the
                future. Scientists in Finland have now shown that an extract of
                willow bark—a plant that has already provided several medicines,
                including the precursor to modern aspirin—has a broad-spectrum
                antiviral effect in cell sample experiments.
              </p>
              <p>
                The extract worked both on enveloped coronaviruses, which cause
                colds as well as COVID-19, and non-enveloped enteroviruses,
                which cause infections such as flu and meningitis. There are no
                clinically approved drugs that work against enteroviruses
                directly, so this extract could be a future game-changer.
              </p>
              <p>
                "We need broadly acting and efficient tools to combat the virus
                load in our everyday life," said Prof Varpu Marjomäki of the
                University of Jyväskylä, senior author of the study in Frontiers
                in Microbiology. "Vaccinations are important, but they cannot
                deal with many of the newly emerging serotypes early enough to
                be effective on their own."
              </p>
              <p>
                The scientists had previously tested willow bark extract on
                enteroviruses, and found it was highly successful. In this new
                study, they expanded the remit of their research to look at
                additional kinds of virus and to try to understand the mechanism
                of the extract's action.
              </p>
              <p>
                To make the extract, they harvested commercially grown willow

                    One of the world's largest mobile data brokers, Kochava, has
                    lost its battle to stop the Federal Trade Commission from
                    revealing what the FTC has alleged is a disturbing,
                    widespread pattern of unfair use and sale of sensitive data

                    The FTC has accused Kochava of violating the FTC Act by
                    amassing and disclosing "a staggering amount of sensitive
                    and identifying information about consumers," alleging that
                    Kochava's database includes products seemingly capable of
                    identifying nearly every person in the United States.<br />[...]<br />the
                    FTC is seeking a permanent injunction to stop Kochava from

                    to unseal the amended complaint that the FTC still has to
                    prove that Kochava has violated the FTC Act, but its
                    arguments are sufficient to survive Kochava's motion for
                    sanctions, which the judge's order also denied.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Winmill, Kochava "has not offered any
                    compelling reason to maintain the amended complaint under
                    seal."
                  </p>

                    "Certainly, the FTC's allegations cast Kochava's services in
                    an unfavorable light," Winmill wrote. "But that is no reason
                    to shield the complaint from public view."

                    that the ruling was "a promising turnaround in a landmark
                    FTC action against a major data broker" and noted that
                    unsealing the complaint has now revealed "Kochava's shocking
                    appetite for the most sensitive details of lives and the
                    ways the company uses that data to profile, target,
                    discriminate, and profit."<br />[...]<br />Winmill said that
                    for now, the FTC has provided enough support for its
                    allegations against Kochava for the lawsuit to proceed.

                So much for the temporary delay or ban on AI. Musk named his AI
                Grok. I'm surprised by the lack of X:es in the name. Perhaps it
                would have looked odd considering the name of the Musk AI
                Company is xAI.
              </p>
              <p>
                Somewhat unclear if the Grok is referring to Hitchhikers guide
                to the Galaxy Grok or to Heinleins Stranger in a Strange Land.
                If you take inspiration from Hitchhikers then it shouldn't be
                that hard to program. If all else fails, the answer to a query
                is always 42. So I guess we'll know what it will default to when
                it starts looping hallucinations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also Grok should apparently be really into sarcasm, so that will
                end well and not lead to any kind of misunderstandings or
                interpretations. None.

                    Chang noted that longer periods of sleep recovery may be
                    necessary to recover from multiple, consecutive nights of
                    sleep loss.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Sleep is a biological process, but it's also a behavioral
                    one and one that we often have a lot of control over," Chang
                    said. "Not only does sleep affect our cardiovascular health,
                    but it also affects our weight, our mental health, our
                    ability to focus and our ability to maintain healthy
                    relationships with others, among many other things. As we
                    learn more and more about the importance of sleep, and how
                    it impacts everything in our lives, my hope is that it will
                    become more of a focus for improving one's health."

                    All of the previous lanterns I've talked about use the flame
                    as a source of light - carbureted in various ways, but
                    "carbon in the flame glowing directly." A mantle is a device
                    that, when heated, glows brightly in the visible regions -
                    it puts out more light than a blackbody radiator at a given
                    temperature, because it uses materials that are low
                    emissivity in the infrared spectrum (heat), and high
                    emissivity in the visible spectrum (light, useful to
                    humans). There are also some benefits from helping contain
                    the flame and the heat within the enclosure, but the end
                    result is rather more light for a given amount of heat than
                    you'd otherwise get.

                I remember similar lanterns from my childhood, including the

                many of our community have ever seen these lanterns anywhere
                other than on TV or in movies? Does anyone here still use a
                similar lamp? - JR

                    Some years ago I wrote about programming a KIM-1 in 1985. By
                    that time the KIM-1 was old, and definitely not state of the
                    art. After all, it was released in 1976.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it's a machine I enjoyed programming (which required
                    punching in code via the hex keypad, or, if you were lucky,
                    connecting a terminal (via a 20mA current loop designed to
                    talk to an actual Teletype) to it and using the very basic
                    monitor program). The KIM-1 could also interface to a
                    paper-tape reader/punch and a cassette for storing and
                    loading programs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have a tiny collection of machines that matter in my
                    personal computing history: a Sharp MZ-80K, a Research
                    Machines 380Z, a Research Machines 480Z, my original BBC
                    Micro and a KIM-1 (that's a picture of my machine above).
                    The (fully working) KIM-1 was made in 1976 and is serial
                    number 2,793. It's still sitting in its original packaging:

                    European space officials will convene on Monday and Tuesday
                    to discuss the future of space policy for the continent. The
                    "Space Summit" gathering in Seville, Spain, will encompass
                    several topics, including the future of launch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the decade since [the Ariane 6] agreement was
                    reached there have been at least three factors that have
                    precipitated a crisis in European launch. One is the rise of
                    SpaceX, which, through its reusable Falcon 9 rocket, has
                    come to dominate the commercial market with prices about
                    half those offered by the Ariane rockets. Because it has
                    optimized for speed, SpaceX can also launch far more
                    frequently and efficiently than Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Secondly, the Ariane 6 rocket has been delayed from its
                    original goal of launching in 2020. Now, if hot-fire tests
                    late this year go well, it is possible that the Ariane 6
                    rocket could make its debut launch by mid-2024, or about
                    four years late. With the retirement of the Ariane 5, and
                    the Russian Soyuz rocket off the market due to the war in
                    Ukraine, Europe finds itself in the embarrassing position of
                    having to rely on SpaceX to get some of its
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/07/europes-euclid-telescope-launched-to-study-the-dark-universe/"
                      >most valuable missions</a
                    >
                    into orbit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, there is the cost issue. The goal of reducing
                    operations costs by 50 percent has dropped to 40 percent.
                    And now, citing inflation, European officials say those cost
                    cuts are not sustainable. In fact, the Ariane 6 rocket's
                    primary contractor, ArianeGroup—which is co-owned by Airbus
                    and Safran—is asking for a significant subsidy to operate
                    the rocket.
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/10/oops-it-looks-like-the-ariane-6-rocket-may-not-offer-europe-any-launch-savings/"
                      >It wants 350 million euros a year</a
                    >, which would essentially wipe out any cost savings from
                    going to the Ariane 6 rocket.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So Europe has spent a decade and many billions of euros
                    developing the Ariane 6 rocket, but all it has gotten them
                    to date is a gap in the capability of launching satellites
                    to orbit. This has ratcheted up tensions heading into
                    Seville this week.

                    Representatives from 22 European countries reached an
                    agreement Monday to change the way the continent's rockets
                    are developed, moving from a government-driven approach to a
                    commercial paradigm that appears to be modeled after how
                    NASA and the US military do business.

                  Australia's news.com.au reports:</a
                ><br />During the Covid pandemic, restaurants introduced QR Code
                menu ordering in an attempt to minimize contact between staff
                and patrons. Australian restaurants have continued this trend
                while taking it to new levels of absurdity, sparking a recent
                flurry of criticism on social media.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I'm so f***ing tired of 'tech' being used to solve an 'issue'
                but only making everything worse and more inconvenient for
                everybody," one Aussie wrote. Followed by a deluge of replies
                and comments.
              </p>
              <p>
                His comment was in response to going to a restaurant and having
                only a QR code to order from - literally a menu at the table
                with only the QR code on it. The app required to order from it
                "proceeded to charge a 6.5% venue surcharge, a 2% payment
                processing fee, and then had the audacity to ask for a tip (10%,
                15%, 25%) as the cherry on top.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hundreds of others enthusiastically agreed and many added they
                also didn't like being asked to enter their personal details.
                "You're waiting your own table and paying an extra fee for the
                privilege. It's f***ed," one person responded. "It's also a big
                stinking FU to anyone old or not tech savvy. All just to hoover
                up your data," another added.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some, however, shared they preferred using QR codes to order
                their food - they removed the need to move to order more and
                limited engagement with staff. "I actually like the QR ordering
                because I don't like people, but the surcharges and tipping can
                f*** off," one said. "I love the QR codes - don't need to leave
                the table to order another beer," someone else wrote...
              </p>
              <p>
                Jonathan Holmes-Ross, owner of board game restaurant, The Lost
                Dice in Adelaide told news.com.au that the use of QR code
                ordering had let his eatery "reduce costs by around 25%... We no
                longer have to take orders, work out bills and manually take
                payments," he said. "This gives our wait staff more time to look
                after our customers, and the kitchen has excellent order
                information as the accuracy of the orders is great. We now have
                very few mistakes saving us time and waste. We can also mark
                items that have run out instantly on the app by using stock
                levels, again avoiding the disappointment of (the) customer."

                    Amazon and Meta have agreed to not use data collected from
                    their marketplaces to unfairly benefit themselves, the UK's

                    the Big Tech duo of not only gathering up information about
                    sellers using their respective online souks, they also -

                    In Amazon's case, the e-commerce giant used vendors' sales
                    figures to decide which items it should sell, and how much
                    to price products to get an edge over everyone else. The

                    the online souk will be prevented from using third-party
                    seller data that gives it an unfair commercial advantage,
                    and will allow rivals to negotiate rates with independent
                    delivery contractors working on behalf of Amazon.

                    The social media mega-corp was accused of exploiting
                    advertisers hawking wares on Facebook Marketplace, and using
                    competitors' data to improve its own products or services.

                    "Going forward, competitors of Facebook Marketplace that
                    advertise on Meta platforms can 'opt out' of their data
                    being used to improve Facebook Marketplace. Without these
                    measures in place, Meta risks having an unfair competitive
                    advantage that could distort competition," the CMA said.

                  <p>
                    "Having assessed the commitments and the feedback received,
                    including from sellers, advertisers and customers, we
                    believe both sets of commitments address the specific
                    competition concerns we had here in the UK," Ann Pope, the
                    watchdog's senior director for antitrust enforcement,
                    concluded.

                    Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a free alternative
                    that's guaranteed to work perfectly on an indefinite basis
                    right now.

                    One popular browser extension called
                    <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> seems
                    to be the easiest and best bet right now, with users
                    claiming it works best on Firefox (though it's worked for me
                    on Chrome, too).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some folks are switching browsers to Firefox or even
                    Microsoft Edge just to find a way to watch YouTube videos in
                    peace.

                  <p>
                    The problem with this is that YouTube will almost certainly
                    weed out working alternatives over time, so some degree of
                    adaptability may be required here on the user end. Or, you
                    could just give in and pay for YouTube Premium. It's not fun
                    or ideal, but you can at least guarantee it'll work.

                    As for the new chips, both feature a hybrid core
                    architecture and include a combination of Zen 4 and Zen 4c
                    cores. The more high-end one is the Ryzen 5 7545U, which is
                    a 6-core, 12-thread part with 2 Zen 4 cores and 4 Zen 4c
                    cores. It comes with a 3.2GHz base clock and a 4.9GHz boost
                    clock, a 15-30W TDP range, and Radeon 740M integrated
                    graphics. The 7545U has 22MB of total cache, including 16MB
                    of L3.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The other new chip in AMD's portfolio is the Ryzen 3 7440U,
                    which is a 4-core, 8-thread part with a base clock of 3GHz
                    and a boost clock of up to 4.7GHz. It has the same TDP range
                    of 15-30W as the Ryzen 5 part, but only offers 12MB of total
                    cache, including 8MB of L3. Like the 7545U, the 7440U also
                    comes with Radeon 740M integrated graphics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new hybrid core architecture has thrown a spotlight on
                    the new Zen 4c cores, with obvious questions about how they
                    differ from Zen 4. According to AMD, the new cores are
                    designed for density and power efficiency and are 35 percent
                    smaller than Zen 4. The new core architecture also offers
                    better scalability, with the potential for allowing higher
                    core counts in future high-end mobile processors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company claimed that Zen 4c is a great option for
                    entry-level devices, as the smaller cores with the same IPC
                    consume less power than Zen 4, allowing the chips to deliver
                    more performance below 15W. However, Zen 4 still supports a
                    higher absolute clock limit compared to Zen 4c, enabling the
                    new hybrid chips to offer optimized performance in heavy
                    workloads while delivering a high degree of efficiency.

                Sunflowers famously turn their faces to follow the sun as it
                crosses the sky. But how do sunflowers "see" the sun to follow
                it? New work from plant biologists at the University of
                California, Davis, published Oct. 31 in PLOS Biology, shows that
                they use a different, novel mechanism from that previously
                thought.
              </p>
              <p>
                "This was a total surprise for us," said Stacey Harmer,
                professor of plant biology at UC Davis and senior author on the
                paper.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most plants show phototropism—the ability to grow toward a light
                source. Plant scientists had assumed that sunflowers'
                heliotropism, the ability to follow the sun, would be based on
                the same basic mechanism, which is governed by molecule called
                phototropin and responds to light at the blue end of the
                spectrum.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sunflowers swing their heads by growing a little more on the
                east side of the stem—pushing the head west—during the day and a
                little more on the west side at night, so the head swings back
                toward the east. Harmer's lab at the UC Davis College of
                Biological Sciences has previously shown how sunflowers use
                their internal circadian clock to anticipate the sunrise, and to
                coordinate the opening of florets with the appearance of
                pollinating insects in the morning.

                    Whether we like it or not, we all use the cloud to
                    communicate and to store and process our data. We use dozens
                    of cloud services, sometimes indirectly and unwittingly. We
                    do so because the cloud brings real benefits to individuals
                    and organizations alike. We can access our data across
                    multiple devices, communicate with anyone from anywhere, and
                    command a remote data center's worth of power from a
                    handheld device.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But using the cloud means our security and privacy now
                    depend on cloud providers. Remember: The cloud is just
                    another way of saying "someone else's computer." Cloud
                    providers are single points of failure and prime targets for
                    hackers to scoop up everything from proprietary corporate
                    communications to our personal photo albums and financial
                    documents.

                  <p>
                    [...] It's not just attackers we have to worry about. Some
                    companies use their access—benefiting from weak laws,
                    complex software, and lax oversight—to mine and sell our
                    data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our message is simple: It is possible to get the best of
                    both worlds. We can and should get the benefits of the cloud
                    while taking security back into our own hands. Here we
                    outline a strategy for doing that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the last few years, a slew of ideas old and new have
                    converged to reveal a path out of this morass, but they
                    haven't been widely recognized, combined, or used. These
                    ideas, which we'll refer to in the aggregate as
                    "decoupling," allow us to rethink both security and privacy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here's the gist. The less someone knows, the less they can
                    put you and your data at risk. In security this is called
                    Least Privilege. The

                      href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2022/papers/hotnets22_schmitt.pdf"
                      >decoupling principle</a
                    >
                    applies that idea to cloud services by making sure systems
                    know as little as possible while doing their jobs. It states
                    that we gain security and privacy by separating private data
                    that today is unnecessarily concentrated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The needed protocols and infrastructure exist, and
                    there are services that can do all of this already, without
                    sacrificing the performance, quality, and usability of
                    conventional cloud services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But we cannot just rely on industry to take care of this.
                    Self-regulation is a time-honored stall tactic: A piecemeal
                    or superficial tech-only approach would likely undermine the
                    will of the public and regulators to take action. We need a
                    belt-and-suspenders strategy, with government policy that
                    mandates decoupling-based best practices, a tech sector that
                    implements this architecture, and public awareness of both
                    the need for and the benefits of this better way forward.

                    Forty percent of parents who worked remotely during the
                    COVID-19 pandemic reported higher parenting stress compared
                    with only 27 percent of parents who worked onsite, reports a
                    new survey from scientists at Northwestern University and
                    Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago.

                    The study results revealed a gender difference: Fathers who
                    worked from home were twice as likely to report that
                    parenting was stressful all or most of the time compared to
                    fathers who worked onsite. Parenting stress for mothers who
                    worked at home was slightly higher, but it did not reach
                    statistical significance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study found no differences in mental or general health
                    between parents who worked remotely or onsite.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our survey results show that teleworking during the
                    pandemic was associated with more parenting stress,
                    especially for fathers," said lead author Dr. John James
                    Parker, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern
                    University Feinberg School of Medicine and a pediatrician at
                    Lurie Children's. "This might be a reflection of societal
                    expectations that men should prioritize work obligations
                    over family needs, which creates additional stress for
                    fathers working from home."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The study authors recommend parents reflect on their
                    family and work situation and try to find an arrangement
                    that limits stress and promotes well-being.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This can be as simple as putting a noise-cancelling machine
                    in the workspace, rearranging schedules to limit
                    distractions and planning time for parents to step away from
                    work to be fully engaged with their children," said Parker,
                    who also is an internist at Northwestern Medicine.

                According to an observational study cats are found to have at

                    Each of the cat's expressions was made up of a mix of four
                    out of 26 unique facial movements - things like open mouths,
                    wide or small pupils, blinks, nose licks, whisker movements,
                    and ear positions. By comparison, humans have around 44
                    unique facial movements, and dogs have 27, but the total
                    number of expressions isn't known. Of the recorded facial
                    expressions, around 45% were thought to be friendly, and 37%
                    were more aggressive or angry, with the leftover 18% an
                    unclear mixture of the two.

                    nonsocial species," says Daniel Mills, a veterinary
                    behaviorist at the University of Lincoln who was not
                    involved in the study. The facial expressions described in
                    the new study suggest otherwise, he notes. "There is clearly
                    a lot going on that we are not aware of."

                    new study. One day it might be used to design an app to help
                    cat owners better understand their pets' subtle cues, she
                    adds. "This could really help the cat-human bond."

                    On Tuesday, Brown announced his decision to challenge his
                    account's suspension in court in Berlin. "This is a matter
                    of principle," he says. "I think it is important that
                    platforms like Twitter are not allowed to shut down
                    criticism arbitrarily." X did not reply to repeated requests
                    for comment.<br />[...]<br />The legal proceedings in
                    Germany are ongoing. For Ballon, the best case scenario
                    would be if the court reinstates Brown's account again or
                    rules the block to be unlawful. The worst outcome would be
                    if the court declines to rule on the case because X's
                    European Union headquarters are based in Ireland. HateAid is

                    [...] The fine yet abrasive silicate-heavy material on the

                    wheezing to nasal congestion that lasted for days in some
                    cases, and made the inside of the Apollo 17 spacecraft smell

                    The problem is compounded by the low gravity on the Moon,

                Coding with the pope: Catholic school children are going to be
                tempted to learn to code with the Pope. Or the pope is going to
                tell them to learn to code, cause that is what God wants? One
                imagines it will be a bigger draw in catholic countries, not so
                much in the rest of the world. Unless the program is really good
                and can be used by heathens and heretics to.

                    For centuries, naturalists have puzzled over what might
                    constitute the head of a sea star, commonly called a
                    "starfish." When looking at a worm, or a fish, it's clear
                    which end is the head and which is the tail. But with their
                    five identical arms—any of which can take the lead in
                    propelling sea stars across the seabed—it's been anybody's
                    guess how to determine the front end of the organism from
                    the back. This unusual body plan has led many to conclude
                    that sea stars perhaps don't have a head at all.

                    But now, labs at Stanford University and UC Berkeley, each
                    led by Chan Zuckerberg Biohub San Francisco Investigators,
                    have published a study finding that the truth is closer to
                    the absolute reverse. In short, while the team detected gene
                    signatures associated with head development just about
                    everywhere in juvenile sea stars, expression of genes that
                    code for an animal's torso and tail sections were largely
                    missing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers used a variety of high-tech molecular and
                    genomic techniques to understand where different genes were
                    expressed during the development and growth of sea stars. A
                    team at Southampton used micro-CT scanning to understand the
                    shape and structure of the animal in unprecedented detail.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In another surprising finding, molecular signatures
                    typically associated with the front-most portion of the head
                    were localized to the middle of each of the sea star's arms,
                    with these signatures becoming progressively more posterior
                    moving out towards the arms' edges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "It's as if the sea star is completely missing a
                    trunk, and is best described as just a head crawling along
                    the seafloor," said Laurent Formery, a postdoctoral scholar
                    and lead author of the new study. "It's not at all what
                    scientists have assumed about these animals."

                    Disney has said Hulu has been profitable some quarters, but
                    anonymous "industry executives" cited in an April report
                    from
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/comcasts-roberts-has-upper-hand-over-iger-as-hulu-battle-looms"

                    >
                    said they thought Hulu was worth less than its 2019
                    valuation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The April report also cited "three people with knowledge of
                    the matter," who claimed that "accounting rules allow
                    entertainment companies to report content costs on their
                    profit statements over a period of years, which is why a
                    service can report a profit even if it is burning cash. And
                    as of last year, Hulu's content, technology, and personnel
                    costs outweighed the revenue it generates," The Information
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As of July 1, Hulu was said to have 48.3 million
                    subscribers. In May, Disney+ said it had 146.1 million
                    subscribers, but that was after it

                    in Q2 2023. That same quarter, Disney's streaming service
                    losses were $512 million.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As it stands, though, Disney appears to be committed to the
                    minimum price set in 2019.

                    phones more than 20 times a day had a 21% higher risk for a

                    for a low sperm concentration, a less important measure of
                    sperm count in a milliliter of semen. The study did not

                    compared to modern 4G and 5G versions. This is not something
                    I am able to explain," said Allan Pacey, deputy vice
                    president and deputy dean of the faculty of biology,
                    medicine and health at the University of Manchester in the

                    Going forward, Uber and Lyft drivers in New York State will
                    get paid sick leave. The companies must also provide hiring
                    notices that "accurately explain the earnings to which
                    drivers are entitled for their work" and earnings statements
                    that "accurately detail the compensation earned for each pay
                    period," the announcement said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Uber and Lyft must "notify drivers after each ride of the
                    amount paid by the rider," provide the right to "appeal all
                    deactivations from the Uber and Lyft platforms," and offer
                    in-app chat support in multiple languages.

                  <p>
                    In parts of the state outside New York City, drivers will
                    receive at least $26 per hour, adjusted annually for
                    inflation. Drivers in New York City will continue to receive

                    [...] "New York is the first state in the country with which
                    Uber has agreed to a settlement that addresses both past and

                    the settlement "prioritizes the benefits drivers want
                    without sacrificing the independence and flexibility they
                    need." It "builds on the benefits and protections that
                    drivers already enjoy through the state's Black Car Fund,
                    which provides accident disability and workers'
                    compensation, dental and vision coverage, telemedicine
                    services, and more," Lyft said.

                    And, well, it's kind of really weird. The surface of the
                    fluid seems to form an independent two-dimensional layer
                    that transports heat away from the rod. The bulk of the
                    superfluid underneath it acts almost like a vacuum; it's
                    entirely passive and doesn't feel like anything at all, the
                    researchers found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The only part of the fluid that interacted with the probe
                    was that two-dimensional surface layer. The bulk only
                    becomes accessible if a huge burst of energy is imparted
                    into it. The thermomechanical properties of the superfluid
                    are entirely defined by that two-dimensional layer.

                  <p>
                    "This liquid would feel two-dimensional if you could stick
                    your finger into it. The bulk of the superfluid feels empty,
                    while heat flows in a two-dimensional subsystem along the
                    edges of the bulk – in other words, along your finger,"
                    Autti says.

                    The tasteless poll questioned whether readers thought the

                    Microsoft of "damaging its journalistic reputation" by

                    feed" that is "tailored by an algorithm to the interests of
                    our audiences" back in 2020, as a spokesperson told the
                    broadcaster, a lot of badly researched, and easily disproven
                    content has the potential to be seen by millions of users.

                    Whether the company's concerns will result in meaningful

                    Evaporation is happening all around us all the time, from
                    the sweat cooling our bodies to the dew burning off in the
                    morning sun. But science's understanding of this ubiquitous
                    process may have been missing a piece all this time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In recent years, some researchers have been puzzled upon
                    finding that water in their experiments, which was held in a
                    sponge-like material known as a hydrogel, was evaporating at
                    a higher rate than could be explained by the amount of heat,
                    or thermal energy, that the water was receiving. The excess
                    has been significant—a doubling, or even a tripling or more,
                    of the theoretical maximum rate.
                  </p>

                    After carrying out a series of new experiments and
                    simulations, and reexamining some of the results from
                    various groups that claimed to have exceeded the thermal
                    limit, a team of researchers at MIT has reached a startling
                    conclusion: Under certain conditions, at the interface where
                    water meets air, light can directly bring about evaporation
                    without the need for heat, and it actually does so even more
                    efficiently than heat. In these experiments, the water was
                    held in a hydrogel material, but the researchers suggest
                    that the phenomenon may occur under other conditions as
                    well.

                    this year, the good folks at the New England Journal of
                    Medicine offer some fresh nightmare fuel ahead of Halloween:
                    an ear spider. And there's a video.
                  </p>

                      >a short clinical report published in this week's issue</a
                    >, doctors in Tainan City, Taiwan, detail the case of a
                    64-year-old woman who sought care at an otolaryngology (ENT)
                    clinic. She came in complaining of having an incessant
                    ruckus in her left ear for the previous four days. On the
                    first day of symptoms, the woman said she was awoken by a
                    feeling of a wee creature crawling in her ear canal. That
                    feeling was then followed by days of clicking, beating, and
                    rustling noises.<br />[...]<br />Video of the creepy crawler
                    shows it darting around the canal, just in front of the
                    eardrum. When it spots the medical probe nearing, the spider
                    comes in for a closer look, facing the camera directly for a
                    perfect view of its eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The medical report doesn't identify the type of spider it
                    is, and it's usually very difficult to identify spiders
                    based on pictures. But Ars reached out to two spider experts
                    who both said the spider is, without a doubt, in the family
                    of jumping spiders (Salticidae). The giveaway is "the
                    family-specific arrangement and size ratio of the eyes,"
                    Martin Nyffeler, an emeritus senior lecturer in zoology at
                    the University of Basel, told Ars over email. Specifically,
                    this family of spiders has large median front eyes, which
                    can be seen in the ear spider when it looks directly into
                    the camera.<br />[...]<br />The doctors treating the woman
                    reported no damage to her eardrum. They sucked the spider
                    and its exuvia out, and the woman's symptoms "immediately
                    abated," they reported

                    [...] Another of Franklin's innovations was in the paper
                    itself. The invention of including tiny fibers in paper pulp
                    — visible as pigmented squiggles within paper money — has
                    often been credited to paper manufacturer Zenas Marshall
                    Crane, who introduced this practice in 1844. But Manukyan
                    and his team found evidence that Franklin was including
                    colored silks in his paper much earlier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team also discovered that notes printed by Franklin's
                    network have a distinctive look due to the addition of a
                    translucent material they identified as muscovite. The team
                    determined that Franklin began adding muscovite to his
                    papers and the size of this muscovite crystals in his paper
                    increased over time. The team speculates that Franklin
                    initially began adding muscovite to make the printed notes
                    more durable but continued to add it when it proved to be a
                    helpful deterrent to counterfeiters.

                    also need to address what it is that you're trying to cope

                    Perhaps older people who did not grow up with dating apps
                    approach them with a healthy level of circumspection and
                    tend to be more selective in their matches, Aboujaoude said.

                    It's become so darn easy to order stuff thanks to the
                    miracles of online shopping. But it's not so simple on the
                    retailer end, especially when more than 16 per cent of those
                    sales are later sent back. In the U.S., that adds up to a
                    staggering $816 billion in lost revenue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cross-selling can help, say a pair of researchers. Their
                    experiments show that once we've chosen to buy something, we
                    tend to consider that money as already spent or gone, also
                    called "loss booking." If we decide we want to return the
                    item, retailers can take advantage of that tendency by
                    giving customers enticing options to spend their refund on
                    something else, instead of getting their money back.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a nutshell, "it hurts less to spend money refunded from a
                    product return than other money, because you feel like
                    you've already lost it," says researcher Chang-Yuan Lee, an
                    assistant professor of marketing at the University of
                    Toronto's Rotman School of Management.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There's a catch though. The shopper has to
                    psychologically mark the initial spend as lost, something
                    that does not happen when they expect to ask for a refund at
                    the time of purchase. Study participants who bought two
                    pairs of shoes in different sizes, expecting to return the
                    poorer-fitting pair, were not so likely to turn around and
                    immediately apply the refund to something else offered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While consumers could be discouraged from making
                    returns by being charged extra fees, that leaves a bad taste
                    in their mouth and previous research has shown they may take
                    their business elsewhere.

                Do you typically want your money back, or do you find something
                else to spend it on?

                    A NASA astronaut who was removed from the ill-fated Apollo
                    13 mission but helped bring its crew back home safely thanks
                    to his problem-solving efforts from ground control has died
                    at the age of 87.

                    Thomas K. "TK" Mattingly passed away on October 31, the
                    space agency said in a statement Thursday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    His most dramatic role came when he was assigned as command
                    module pilot for the Apollo 13 flight but was grounded 72
                    hours prior to launch due to exposure to rubella, NASA
                    Administrator Bill Nelson said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After an explosion crippled the spacecraft on its way to the
                    Moon, Mattingly, who did not in fact get sick, went to
                    Mission Control and devised procedures to conserve power so
                    the vehicle could successfully re-enter the atmosphere,
                    ensuring astronauts James Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred
                    Haise survived.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mattingly began his career as a US Navy pilot before
                    being selected to the astronaut class of 1966. He later took
                    on the role of command module pilot on the Apollo 16 mission
                    and was the spacecraft commander in two Space Shuttle
                    missions.

                    [...] It is now up to the judge, Lewis Kaplan, to determine
                    what Bankman-Fried's sentence will be. While the charges
                    carry a statutory minimum of 110 years, and sentencing
                    guidelines provide a type of formula, the judge has
                    wide-ranging discretion to rule below that guidance.
                    However, CBS News legal analyst Rikki Klieman says if Judge
                    Kaplan "believes the defendant was committing perjury in his
                    courtroom, he might even go above the guidelines."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For her part, Tien, the former FTX employee, said that jail
                    time might too harsh, wondering if Bankman-Fried could
                    perhaps instead help the government investigate other
                    potential crypto-trading fraud.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The next trial in the saga of the United States vs. Sam
                    Bankman-Fried is scheduled for March, 11, 2024, when other
                    charges that the government did not bring forward will be
                    folded into yet another court proceeding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This trial concludes almost one year to the day FTX stopped
                    allowing customers to withdraw deposits, which marked the
                    beginning of the end of the so-called crypto king's meteoric
                    rise.

                    [....] The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
                    announced today (Oct. 31) that it has wrapped up its

                    safety review, which assesses the risks that a launch might
                    pose to public health and property.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, there's still another regulatory box to check
                    before
                    <a href="https://www.space.com/18853-spacex.html">SpaceX</a>
                    can get a license for the next Starship liftoff.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The FAA is continuing to work on the environmental review,"
                    the agency wrote today in an emailed statement. "As part of
                    its environmental review, the FAA is consulting with the
                    U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) on an updated
                    Biological Assessment under the Endangered Species Act. The
                    FAA and the USFWS must complete this consultation before the
                    environmental review portion of the license evaluation is
                    completed."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] "SpaceX must implement all corrective actions that
                    impact public safety and apply for and receive a license
                    modification from the FAA that addresses all safety,
                    environmental and other applicable regulatory requirements
                    prior to the next Starship launch," the agency wrote at the
                    time.

                  <p>
                    And, as today's FAA update notes, there's still work to do
