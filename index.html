                  <p>
                    When Microsoft launched its Copilot+ AI PC initiative over
                    the summer, one of the flagship features was Recall, a
                    feature that would log months' worth of your PC usage, with
                    the stated goal of helping you remember things you did and
                    find them again. But if you've heard of Recall, it's
                    probably because of the problems that surfaced in preview
                    builds of Windows before the feature could launch: It
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/windows-recall-demands-an-extraordinary-level-of-trust-that-microsoft-hasnt-earned/"
                      >stored all of its data in plaintext</a
                    >, and it was relatively trivial for other users on the PC
                    (or for malicious software) to access the database and
                    screenshots, potentially exposing huge amounts of user data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Microsoft has officially announced that the Recall
                    preview is being delayed yet again and that it will begin
                    rolling out to testers in December.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are committed to delivering a secure and trusted
                    experience with Recall. To ensure we deliver on these
                    important updates, we're taking additional time to refine
                    the experience before previewing it with Windows Insiders,"
                    said Microsoft Windows Insider Senior Program Manager
                    Brandon LeBlanc in
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284572/microsoft-recall-delay-december-windows-insider-testing"

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When it does start to roll out, Recall will still
                    require a Copilot+ PC, which gets some AI-related features
                    not available to typical Windows 11 PCs. To meet the
                    Copilot+ requirements, PCs must have at least 16GB of RAM
                    and 256GB of storage, plus a neural processing unit (NPU)
                    that can perform at least 40 trillion operations per second
                    (TOPS).

                    A former jockey who was left paralyzed from the waist down
                    after a horse riding accident was able to walk again thanks
                    to a cutting-edge piece of robotic tech: a $100,000 ReWalk
                    Personal exoskeleton.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When one of its small parts malfunctioned, however, the
                    entire device stopped working. Desperate to gain his
                    mobility back, he reached out to the manufacturer, Lifeward,
                    for repairs. But it turned him away, claiming his
                    exoskeleton was too old,

                      ><em>404 media</em></a

                    reports.

                  <p>
                    "After 371,091 steps my exoskeleton is being retired after
                    10 years of unbelievable physical therapy," Michael Straight
                    posted on Facebook earlier this month. "The reasons why it
                    has stopped is a pathetic excuse for a bad company to try
                    and make more money."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Straight, the issue was caused by a piece of
                    wiring that had come loose from the battery that powered a
                    wristwatch used to control the exoskeleton. This would cost
                    peanuts for Lifeward to fix up, but it refused to service
                    anything more than five years old, Straight said.

                    [...] As this infuriating case shows, advanced medical
                    devices can change the lives of people living with severe
                    disabilities — but the flipside is that they also make their
                    owners dependent on the whims of the devices' manufacturers,
                    who often operate in ruthless self-interest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] That some of these manufacturers can come and go isn't
                    the point, though. As <em>404</em> notes, the issue is the
                    nefarious practices that many of them use to make their
                    devices difficult to fix without their help.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This is the dystopian nightmare that we've kind of
                    entered in, where the manufacturer perspective on products
                    is that their responsibility completely ends when it hands
                    it over to a customer," Nathan Proctor, head of the right to
                    repair project at the US Public Interest Research Group,
                    told <em>404</em>. "That's not good enough for a device like
                    this, but it's also the same thing we see up and down with
                    every single product."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "People need to be able to fix things, there needs to be a
                    plan in place," he added. "A $100,000 product you can only
                    use as long as the battery lasts, that's enraging."

                    In December, the verified Facebook page of Adam Klotz, a Fox
                    News meteorologist, started running strange video ads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some featured the distinctive voice of former President
                    Donald Trump promising "$6,400 with your name on it, no
                    payback required" just for clicking the ad and filling out a
                    form.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In other ads with the same offer, President Joe Biden's
                    well-known cadence assured viewers that "this isn't a loan
                    with strings attached."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There was no free cash. The audio was generated by AI.
                    People who clicked were taken to a form asking for their
                    personal information, which was sold to telemarketers who
                    could target them for legitimate offers — or scams.<br />[...]<br />Klotz's
                    page had been co-opted by a sprawling ad account network
                    that has operated on Facebook for years, churning out
                    roughly 100,000 misleading election and social issues ads
                    despite Meta's stated commitment to crack down on harmful
                    content, according to an investigation and analysis by
                    ProPublica and Columbia Journalism School's Tow Center for

                    The network, which uses the name Patriot Democracy on many
                    of its ad accounts, is one of eight deceptive Meta
                    advertising operations identified by ProPublica and Tow.
                    These networks have collectively controlled more than 340
                    Facebook pages, as well as associated Instagram and
                    Messenger accounts. Most were created by the advertising
                    networks, with some pages masquerading as government
                    entities. Others were verified pages of people with public
                    roles, like Klotz, who had been hacked. The networks have
                    placed more than 160,000 election and social issues ads on
                    these pages in English and Spanish. Meta showed the ads to
                    users nearly 900 million times across Facebook and
                    Instagram.<br />[..]<br />Most of these networks are run by
                    lead-generation companies, which gather and sell people's
                    personal information. People who clicked on some of these
                    ads were unwittingly signed up for monthly credit card
                    charges, among many other schemes. Some, for example, were
                    conned by an unscrupulous insurance agent into changing
                    their Affordable Care Act health plans. While the agent
                    earns a commission, the people who are scammed can lose
                    their health insurance or face unexpected tax bills because
                    of the switch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ads run by the networks employ tactics that Meta has
                    banned, including the undisclosed use of deepfake audio and
                    video of national political figures and promoting misleading
                    claims about government programs to bait people into sharing
                    personal information. Thousands of ads illegally displayed
                    copies of state and county seals and the images of governors
                    to trick users. "The State has recently approved that
                    Illinois residents under the age of 89 may now qualify for
                    up to $35,000 of Funeral Expense Insurance to cover any and
                    all end-of-life expenses!" read one deceptive ad featuring a
                    photo of Gov. JB Pritzker and the Illinois state seal.

                    update didn’t include a battery charging limit feature that

                    >. With seven-year update commitments from some Android
                    phone manufacturers, the onus is now on us to stop our
                    batteries from degrading too far.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What was most striking to us about the results of this poll
                    was that less than 12% of you don’t use any battery
                    management tricks at all. With battery degradation being a
                    slow and subtle process, we assumed that many more people
                    wouldn’t consider it. But hey, we should have given our
                    tech-savvy readers more credit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While it’s clear that you do indeed take battery health
                    seriously, there isn’t a consensus amongst the responses on
                    the best way to address it. Almost 33% of you follow the
                    advice to only charge the battery to 80% full, while
                    slightly more of you use adaptive charging. The latter
                    approach intelligently slows the charging process based on
                    usage patterns to reduce battery wear and extend its overall
                    lifespan. This could include fast charging to around 80%,
                    then slowly topping up from there when you’re not in a hurry
                    to unplug. 7.6% of you suggest you use two or more of these
                    tricks, which is a real dedication to getting the most out
                    of your battery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you don’t use any battery management tricks and you’re
                    keen to start now, it’s worth checking out the battery
                    settings in your device. It only takes 30 seconds and could
                    keep your battery healthy for another six months.

                janrinok: I charge my 'phone when the battery is getting low,
                usually overnight, and in the morning it is 100%. I purchased my
                'phone in 2016 and it is still using the original battery. It
                might (and I am not certain) just be beginning to lose a
                fraction of its charge over a 2 day period. Do you use a special
                charging cycle? How long does a battery normally last you? And
                do you replace the battery or just upgrade to the latest and
                greatest on the market?

                    Instead, SDOs are asking Congress to rewrite the
                    Constitution and affirm that SDOs retain copyright in their
                    standards no matter what a federal regulator does, as long
                    as they make them available online. We know what that means
                    because the SDOs have already created "reading rooms" for
                    some of their standards, and they show us that the SDOs'
                    idea of "making available" is "making available as if it was
                    1999." The texts are not searchable, cannot be printed,
                    downloaded, highlighted, or bookmarked for later viewing,
                    and cannot be magnified without becoming blurry.
                    Cross-referencing and comparison is virtually impossible.
                    Often, a reader can view only a portion of each page at a
                    time and, upon zooming in, must scroll from right to left to
                    read a single line of text. As if that wasn't bad enough,
                    these reading rooms are inaccessible to print-disabled
                    people altogether..

                    It's a bad bargain that would trade our fundamental due
                    process rights in exchange for a pinky promise of highly
                    restricted access to the law. But if Congress takes that
                    step, it's a comfort to know that we can take the fight back
                    to the courts and trust that judges, if not legislators,
                    understand why laws are facts, not property, and should be
                    free for all to access, read, and share.

                    [...] This is the promise of the Fediverse: You use whatever
                    social network you want to use and connect with people on
                    whatever social network they want to use. And there are a
                    few other perks. When I quit using Twitter a couple years
                    ago (before it became X), I left all of my followers behind.
                    That's not how it works with the Fediverse: You can switch
                    from one service to another and take your followers with
                    you. That's the kind of freedom you can't get from a
                    centralized system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A number of companies and enthusiasts are working on other
                    ways to connect with the Fediverse.

                    offers a plugin that allows bloggers to share their posts,

                    [...] All of this is possible because the Fediverse is based
                    on an open protocol that anyone can build on. The hope is
                    that, over time, more services will offer integrations and
                    social networking will become as open as email. Is that what
                    will happen for sure? I don't know. And the Fediverse, like
                    anything that exists on the internet, has its share of
                    problems. Moderation, for example, is a huge challenge, and
                    bigger platforms moving into the space could make it harder.

                    I'm only scratching the service with this
                    explanation—there's so much more I could dig into. For the
                    most part, though, when you hear "the Fediverse" you'll now
                    know what it means: a series of social networks and
                    platforms that are connected to each other. You'll hopefully
                    hear a lot more about it in the years to come.

                then, perhaps most Linux followers today where not alive or old
                enough to have experienced Mr. McBride's assault on Linux that
                could have very well ended it's life as Open Source. Of course
                I'm talking about way back in the Stone Age when

                for ownership of the Linux kernel. Those of us who were around
                followed the now defuncted Groklaw for the latest dirt on this
                legal entanglement that is now for the most part forgotten.
              </p>
              <p>From the wikipedia link:</p>

                    McBride has been controversial in the information technology
                    industry for his role as the CEO of SCO in asserting broad
                    claims of intellectual property ownership of the various
                    UNIX operating systems derivatives developed by IBM under a
                    license originally granted by AT&amp;T Corporation. Open
                    source, free software and Linux developers and supporters,
                    and the computer industry at large have been outspoken and
                    highly critical and skeptical of McBride and SCO's claims in
                    these areas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ty Mattingly, a former Novell Executive Vice President and
                    co-worker of McBride was quoted as saying, "Congratulations.
                    In a few short months you've dethroned Bill Gates as the
                    most hated man in the industry."[6] McBride claimed he
                    received death threats as a result of the SCO-IBM lawsuits,
                    and had a package of worms mailed to his home, prompting him
                    to carry a firearm and to employ multiple bodyguards.[4]
                    During an interview, when asked about the popularity of the
                    lawsuit against IBM, McBride answered: "We're either right
                    or we're not. If we're wrong, we deserve people throwing
                    rocks at us."[7]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under McBride's leadership, SCO saw a surge in stock price
                    from under $2 in March 2003 to over $20 just six months
                    later. Following several adverse rulings issued by the
                    United States District Court in Utah, SCO's stock value
                    dropped to under $1. On April 27, 2007, NASDAQ served notice
                    that the company would be delisted if SCO's stock price did
                    not increase above $1 for a minimum of 10 consecutive days
                    over the course of 180 business days, ending October 22,
                    2007.[8]

                    It's easy to laugh and think this is just Google being
                    Google again, but this is a serious problem. By pricing
                    these phones so high, people aren't going to buy them.
                    Google isn't going to keep them forever, and in the end,
                    they end up being stripped of any material that's easy to
                    get while the rest goes into a landfill.

                    [...] Google can afford to sell these refurbs dirt cheap and
                    it gets even more eyeballs on Google's services so Google
                    makes even more money selling ads. I don't know why the
                    company won't do it, but it should.

                    real quantum computer," the paper states. "Additionally,
                    this is the first instance where quantum computing attacks
                    on multiple SPN structure symmetric cipher algorithms have
                    achieved the performance of the traditional mathematical

                    The main contribution in the September paper is the process
                    the researchers used to find integral distinguishers in up
                    to nine rounds of the three previously mentioned algorithms.

                    [...] The paper makes no reference to AES or RSA and never
                    claims to break anything. Instead, it describes a way to use
                    D-Wave-enabled quantum annealing to find the integral
                    distinguisher. Classical attacks have had the optimized
                    capability to find the same integral distinguishers for
                    years. David Jao, a professor specializing in PQC at the
                    University of Waterloo in Canada, likened the research to
                    finding a new lock-picking technique. The end result is the
                    same, but the method is new.

                    [...] This isn't the first time the South China Morning Post
                    has fueled undue panic about the imminent fall of widely
                    used encryption algorithms.

                      >Last year's hype train</a
                    >, mentioned earlier in this article, was touched off by
                    coverage by the same publication that claimed researchers
                    found a factorization method that could break a 2,048-bit
                    RSA key using a quantum system with just 372 qubits. People
                    who follow PQC should be especially wary when seeking news
                    there.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The coverage of the September paper is especially overblown
                    because symmetric encryption, unlike RSA and other
                    asymmetric siblings, is are widely belived to be safe from
                    quantum computing, as long as bit sizes are sufficient. PQC
                    experts are confident that AES-256 will resist all known
                    quantum attacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As a reminder, current estimates are that quantum
                    cracking of a single 2048-bit RSA key would require a
                    computer with 20 million qubits running in superposition for
                    about eight hours. For context, quantum computers maxed out
                    at 433 qubits in 2022 and 1,000 qubits last year. (A qubit
                    is a basic unit of quantum computing, analogous to the
                    binary bit in classical computing. Comparisons between
                    qubits in true quantum systems and quantum annealers aren't
                    uniform.) So even when quantum computing matures
                    sufficiently to break vulnerable algorithms, it could take
                    decades or longer before the majority of keys are cracked.

                  <p>
                    The upshot of this latest episode is that while quantum
                    computing will almost undoubtedly topple many of the most
                    widely used forms of encryption used today, that calamitous
                    event won't happen anytime soon. It's important that
                    industries and researchers move swiftly to devise
                    quantum-resistant algorithms and implement them widely. At
                    the same time, people should take steps not to get
                    steamrolled by the PQC hype train.

                    and by claiming subsidies for thousands of subscribers who

                    The settlement fully resolves the FCC investigation into

                A Russia court claims that Google currently owes them 2000000
                0000000000 0000000000 0000000000, or 2 undecillion if you will
                -- a number with 36 trailing zeros, rubles.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is due to a fine of 100 000 rubles per day exponentially
                growing since sometimes in 2021 due to Google blocking various
                Russian sites from Youtube.
              </p>
              <p>
                The slight problem is that the fine is now so large that it is
                many, many, times the entire worlds combined GDP. I don't think
                they should expect to get paid anytime soon.

                    Scientists in China have pulled off a remarkable feat worthy
                    of Victor Frankenstein: reviving pigs’ brains up to 50
                    minutes after a complete loss of blood circulation. The
                    macabre accomplishment could someday lead to advances in
                    keeping people’s brains intact and healthy for longer while
                    resuscitating them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Past studies have suggested that liver function plays
                    a key role in how well the rest of the body does during a
                    cardiac arrest. People with pre-existing liver disease, for
                    instance, seem to have a higher risk of dying from a cardiac
                    arrest. So the researchers, based primarily at Sun Yat-Sen
                    University, decided to test whether keeping the livers of
                    Tibetan minipigs functionally alive could have a positive
                    effect on their brains’ survivability after resuscitation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All of the pigs had blood flow to their brains stopped, but
                    some were hooked up to a life support system that kept their
                    liver’s circulation going. The scientists then tried to
                    revive the pigs’ brains after a certain period of time using
                    the same life support system. Afterward, the pigs were
                    euthanized and compared to a control group of pigs that had
                    their blood flow left alone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the pigs had blood flow to both organs shut down, their
                    brains were substantially more damaged following
                    resuscitation, the researchers found. But the brains of pigs
                    that had their livers supported tended to fare much better,
                    with fewer signs of injury and a restoration of electrical
                    activity that lasted up to six hours. The researchers were
                    also able to restore brain activity in these pigs up to 50
                    minutes after blood flow to the brain was stopped.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Of course, this doesn’t mean that scientists can now
                    return anyone back from the dead perfectly intact with just
                    a little boost to their liver. There are many damaging
                    bodily changes that occur soon after a cardiac arrest, not
                    just those in the brain and liver. And certainly more
                    research will have to be done to confirm the team’s
                    conclusions that the liver is critical to restored brain
                    function. But if this work does continue to pay off, it
                    could someday lead to practical interventions that improve
                    the odds of successful resuscitation in people.

                    [...] That's not to say all the big-name AI companies are
                    lying about their open source street cred. For example,
                    <a

                    >
                    really are open source under the Apache 2 license.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Why is this important? Why do people like me insist that we
                    properly use the term open source? It's not like, after all,
                    the OSI is a government or regulatory organization. It's
                    not. It's just a nonprofit that has created some very useful
                    guidelines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] If we need to check every license for every bit of
                    code, "developers are going to go to legal reviews every
                    time you want to use a new library. Companies are going to
                    be scared to publish things on the internet if they're not
                    clear about the liabilities they're encountering when that
                    source code becomes public."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lorenc continued: "You might think this is only a big
                    company problem, but it's not. It's a shared problem.
                    Everybody who uses open source is going to be affected by
                    this. It could cause entire projects to stop working.
                    Security bugs aren't going to get fixed. Maintenance is
                    going to get a lot harder. We must act together to preserve
                    and defend the definition of open source. Otherwise, the
                    lawyers are going to have to come back. No one wants the
                    lawyers to come back."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I must add that I know a lot of IP lawyers. They do not need
                    or want these headaches. Real open source licenses make life
                    easier for everyone: businesses, programmers, and lawyers.
                    Introducing "open except for someone who might compete with
                    us" or "open except for someone who might deploy the code on
                    a cloud" is just asking for trouble.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the end, open washing will dirty the legal, business, and
                    development work for everyone. Including, ironically, the
                    shortsighted companies now supporting this approach. After
                    all, almost all their work, especially in

                    The other thing is that in order to learn, children need to
                    have fun. But they have fun by really being pushed to
                    explore and create and make new things that are personally
                    meaningful. So you need open-ended environments that allow
                    children to explore and express themselves.

                Being able to code is a new literacy, remarks Professor Bers,
                and like with reading and writing, we need to adapt our learning
                tools to children's developmental ages. One idea here is that of
                a "coding playground" where it's not about following
                step-by-step plans, but about inventing games, pretend play and
                creating anything children can imagine. She is currently working
                on
                <a href="https://sites.bc.edu/devtech/smart-playgrounds/"
                  >a project</a
                >
                to bring such a playground <i>outside</i>: integrating motors,
                sensors and other devices in physical playgrounds, "to bolster
                computational thinking through play".

                Given how fast complicated toys are being thrown aside by young
                children, in contrast to a simple ball -- or a meccano set, for
                the engineering types -- I have my doubts.
              </p>
              <p>
                At least one of the tools mentioned above is aimed at toddlers.
                So put aside your model steam locomotive, oh fellow 'lentil, and
                advice me: from what age do you think we should try to steer
                kids into "coding" or "developing", and which tools should or
                could be used for this?

                    produce Shakespeare. So, while the Infinite Monkey Theorem

                    A monkey randomly pressing keys on a typewriter for an
                    infinite amount of time would eventually type out the
                    complete works of Shakespeare purely by chance, according to

                    This widely known thought experiment is used to help us
                    understand the principles of probability and randomness, and
                    how chance can lead to unexpected outcomes. The idea has
                    been referenced in pop culture from "The Simpsons" to "The

                    However, a new study reveals it would take an unbelievably

                    Voyager 1 can't seem to catch a break. The interstellar
                    traveler recently recovered from a thruster glitch that
                    nearly ended its mission, and now NASA's aging probe stopped
                    sending data to ground control due to an unknown issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Monday, NASA
                    <a
                      href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/voyager/2024/10/28/after-pause-nasas-voyager-1-communicating-with-mission-team/"

                    that Voyager 1 recently experienced a brief pause in
                    communication after turning off one of its radio
                    transmitters. The space agency is now relying on a second
                    radio transmitter that hasn't been used since 1981 to
                    communicate with Voyager 1 until engineers can figure out
                    the underlying issue behind the glitch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The flight team behind the mission first realized something
                    was amiss with Voyager 1's communication when the spacecraft
                    failed to respond to a command. On October 16, the team used
                    NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN)—a global array of giant
                    radio antennas—to beam instructions to Voyager 1, directing
                    it to turn on one of its heaters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Voyager 1 should've sent back engineering data for the team
                    to determine how the spacecraft responded to the command.
                    This process normally takes a couple of days, as the command
                    takes about 23 hours to travel more than 15 billion miles
                    (24 billion kilometers) to the spacecraft and another 23
                    hours for the flight team to receive a signal back. Instead,
                    the command seems to have triggered the spacecraft's fault
                    protection system, which autonomously responds to onboard
                    issues affecting the mission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spacecraft's fault protection system lowered the rate at
                    which its radio transmitter was sending back data to use
                    less power, according to NASA. However, while conserving the
                    spacecraft's power, this mode also changes the X-band radio
                    signal, a frequency range within the electromagnetic
                    spectrum that the DSN's antennas listen for.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The flight team was able to locate the signal a day later
                    but then, on October 19, communication with Voyager 1
                    stopped entirely. Voyager 1's fault protection system
                    appeared to have been triggered twice more, and it turned
                    off the X-band transmitter altogether. The spacecraft
                    switched to a second radio transmitter called the S-band,
                    which uses less power but transmits a significantly fainter
                    signal. Voyager 1's S-band transmitter hadn't been used
                    since 1981, and the flight team was not sure its signal
                    could be detected due to the spacecraft being much farther
                    away today than it was 43 years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the team of engineers didn't want to risk sending
                    another signal to the X-band transmitter, and decided to
                    give it a shot. On October 22, the team sent a command to
                    confirm whether the S-band transmitter is working and was
                    finally able to reconnect with Voyager 1 two days later.
                    NASA engineers are currently working to determine what may
                    have triggered the spacecraft's fault protection system in
                    its attempt to resolve the issue.

                  <p>
                    Voyager 1 launched in 1977, less than a month after its twin
                    probe, Voyager 2, began its journey to space. The spacecraft
                    took a faster route, exiting the asteroid belt earlier than
                    its twin and making close encounters with Jupiter and
                    Saturn. Along the way, it discovered two Jovian moons, Thebe
                    and Metis, as well as five new moons and a new ring called

                    interstellar space in August 2012, becoming the first

                    Voyager 1 is no spring chicken, and its upkeep has not been
                    an easy task over the years, especially from billions of
                    miles away. But all-in-all, humanity's long-standing
                    interstellar probe is well worth the effort.

                    telecom monopolies to affix a sort of “nutrition label” on
                    to broadband connections. The labels will clearly disclose
                    the speed and latency (ping) of your connection, any hidden
                    fees users will encounter, and whether the connection comes
                    with usage caps or “overage fees.”

                    Initially just a voluntary measure, bigger ISPs had to start
                    using the labels back in April. Smaller ISPs had to start
                    using them as of October 10. In most instances they’re

                  <p>
                    As far as regulatory efforts go, it’s not the worst idea.
                    Transparency is lacking in broadband land, and U.S.
                    broadband and cable companies have a 30+ year history of
                    ripping off consumers with an absolute cavalcade of weird
                    restrictions, fees, surcharges, and connection limitations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here’s the thing though:
                    <em
                      >transparently knowing you’re being ripped off doesn’t
                      necessarily stop you from being ripped off</em
                    >. A huge number of Americans live under a broadband
                    monopoly or duopoly, meaning they have no other choice in
                    broadband access. As such, Comcast or AT&amp;T or Verizon
                    can rip you off, and you have absolutely no alternative
                    options that allow you to vote with your wallet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That wouldn’t be as much of a problem if U.S. federal
                    regulators had any interest in reining in regional telecom
                    monopoly power, but they don’t. In fact, members of both
                    parties are historically incapable of even admitting
                    monopoly harm exists. Democrats are notably better at at
                    least trying to do something, even if that something often
                    winds up being decorative regulatory theater.

                  <p>
                    The other problem: with the help of a corrupt Supreme Court,
                    telecoms and their Republican and libertarian besties are
                    currently engaged in an effort to

                    >
                    under the pretense this unleashes “free market innovation.”
                    It, of course, doesn’t; regional monopolies like Comcast
                    just double down on all of their worst impulses, unchecked.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If successful, even fairly basic efforts like this one won’t
                    be spared, as the FCC won’t have the authority to enforce
                    much of anything.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It’s all very demonstrative of a U.S. telecom industry
                    that’s been broken by monopoly power, a lack of competition,
                    and regulatory capture. As a result, even the most basic
                    attempts at consumer protection are constantly undermined by
                    folks who’ve dressed up greed as some
                    <em>elaborate and intellectual ethos</em>.

                Rich countries are countries which have accumulated superior
                knowledge for producing highly-complex leading edge
                technologies. With that go successful enterprises and high pay,
                high quality jobs, and a more diversified economy. Diverting
                money into manufacturing does not need to harm other sectors of
                the economy: look at Silicon Valley. Now the global software
                powerhouse, it started with manufacturing transistors.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Acts passed during this Administration do help: the private
                sector invested approximately $80bn into manufacturing
                construction in 2019; in 2024 that has increased to an
                annualized $220bn.
              </p>
              <p>
                The other two witnesses -- both connected to the Cato Institute
                -- have a different outlook though. Policies where you target
                specific sectors of the economy rarely work, they claim. They
                are bound to stimulate waste and corruption, and direct funds
                away from companies who really could use them: and that's
                without even talking about fiscal deficits and such. Better turn
                those funds towards generalized tax reductions, which will
                ultimately stimulate more investment into the broader economy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, one should take into account the reaction of the outside
                world here: the EU is already working on its own industrial
                policies, largely in response to the Biden Administration's
                Acts. We might very well end-up in a zero-sum game, where the
                only benefactors are a range of companies which are artificially
                kept alive with grant money.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, dear reader, it may come as a surprise to you, but you have
                just been urgently asked -- by a prominent US Presidential
                Candidate -- to give your advice on a

                    A group of researchers in the UK affiliated with the BSS

                    <a

                    >
                    this week calling for the permanent abolition of Daylight
                    Saving Time (DST) and adherence to Greenwich Mean Time
                    (GMT), in large part because modern evidence suggests having
                    that extra hour of sunlight in the evenings is worse for our
                    health than we thought back in the 1970s when the concept
                    was all the rage in Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not only does GMT more closely align with the natural
                    day/light cycle in the UK, the boffins assert, but decades
                    of research into sleep and circadian rhythms have been
                    produced since DST was enacted that have yet to be
                    considered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The human circadian rhythm, the 24-hour cycle our bodies go
                    through, drives a lot about our health beyond sleep. It
                    regulates hormone release, gene expression, metabolism, mood
                    (who isn't grumpier when waking up in January?), and the
                    like. In short, it's important. Messing with that rhythm by
                    forcing ourselves out of bed earlier for several months out
                    of the year can have lasting effects, the researchers said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to their review of recent research, having light
                    trigger our circadian rhythms in the mornings to wake us up
                    is far more important than an extra hour of light in the
                    evenings. In fact, contrary to the belief that an extra hour
                    of light in the evenings is beneficial, it might actually
                    cause health problems by, again, mucking about with the
                    human body's understanding of what time it is and how we
                    ought to feel about it.

                    The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has
                    finalized a rule that requires banks, credit card issuers,
                    and most other financial firms to provide consumers with
                    access to their personal financial data - and to help them
                    transfer it, generally at no cost.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the rule eventually takes effect – anywhere from 2026
                    to 2030 depending upon financial firm assets and revenue,
                    with the largest institutions having the least time to
                    comply – it aims to make financial services more competitive
                    by allowing consumers to move to different vendors more
                    easily.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under this "open banking" rule, covered financial firms:
                    "shall make available to a consumer, upon request,
                    information in the control or possession of the covered
                    person concerning the consumer financial product or service
                    that the consumer obtained from such covered person, subject
                    to certain exceptions."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This data has to be made available in an electronic form
                    usable by consumers and authorized third parties.

                    [...] "Too many Americans are stuck in financial products
                    with lousy rates and service," said CFPB director Rohit

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rule also outlines required privacy protections for
                    personal financial data, specifying that third parties can
                    only use data for a requested product or service.

                    "They cannot secretly collect, use, or retain consumers’
                    data for their own unrelated business reasons – for example,
                    by offering consumers a loan using consumer data that they
                    also use for targeted advertising," the CFPB said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rule prohibits data providers from making consumer data
                    available to third parties through screen scraping and it
                    requires that businesses delete consumer data when a person
                    revokes access.

                    Despite an official ban on Russian government workers using

                    government staff from using iPhones. Purportedly, it was
                    because the FSB believed the US was using the iPhone for
                    eavesdropping.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now according to <em>Reuters</em>, local Russian sources

                    the ban rather failed. While the figures have yet to be
                    confirmed by any other source, the
                    <em>Vedomosti</em> business daily claims that purchases of
                    iPhones from January 2024 to September would four times
                    higher year over year.

                  <p>
                    [...] That rather dispels any idea that Russian officials
                    are rebelling against the ban en masse. But it also points
                    to how the original ban was seemingly far from a blanket
                    one.

                  <p>
                    Equally, that destroys the idea that the FSB can be serious
                    in its allegations of iPhone wiretapping. It's always been
                    more likely that any ban is a retaliation for how Apple

                    a solid material to nearby quantum defects. They

                  <p>
                    The problem that the researchers aim to solve is the
                    diffraction limit of light in standard CDs and DVDs. Current
                    optical storage has a hard cap on data density because each
                    single bit can't be smaller than the wavelength of the
                    reading/writing laser.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers propose bypassing this limit by stuffing the
                    material with rare-earth emitters, such as magnesium oxide
                    (MgO) crystals. The trick, called wavelength multiplexing,
                    involves having each emitter use a slightly different
                    wavelength of light. They theorized that this would allow
                    cramming far more data into the same storage footprint.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers first had to tackle the physics and model
                    all the requirements to build a proof of concept. They
                    simulated a theoretical solid material filled with
                    rare-earth atoms that absorb and re-emit light. The models
                    then showed how the nearby quantum defects could capture and
                    store the returned light.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the fundamental discoveries was that when a defect
                    absorbs the narrow wavelength energy from those nearby
                    atoms, it doesn't just get excited – its spin state flips.
                    Once it flips, it is nearly impossible to revert, meaning
                    those defects could legitimately store data for a long time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While it's a promising first step, some crucial questions
                    still need answers. For example, verifying how long those
                    excited states persist is essential. Details were also light
                    on capacity estimates – the scientists touted
                    "ultra-high-density" but didn't provide any projections
                    against current disc capacities. Yet, despite the remaining
                    hurdles, the researchers are hyped, calling it a "huge first
                    step."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, turning all this into an actual commercial
                    storage product will likely take years of additional
                    research and development.

                    [...] As of this writing, asking Google for the best steak,
                    steakhouse, or steak sandwich in London (or similar) isn't
                    generating an AI Overview result for me. But when I searched
                    for the best steak sandwich in London, the top result is
                    from Reddit, including a thread from four days ago titled
                    "Which Angus Steakhouse do you recommend for their steak
                    sandwich?" and one from two days ago titled "Had to see what
                    all the hype was about, best steak sandwich I've ever had!"
                    with a picture of an Angus Steakhouse.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Again, at this point the Angus Steakhouse hype doesn't
                    appear to have made it into AI Overview. But it is appearing
                    in Search results. And while this is far from being a
                    dangerous attempt to manipulate search results or AI
                    algorithms, it does highlight the pitfalls of Google results
                    becoming dependent on content generated by users who could
                    very easily have intentions other than providing helpful
                    information. This is also far from the first time that
                    online users, including on platforms outside of Reddit, have
                    publicly declared plans to make inaccurate or misleading
                    posts in an effort to thwart AI scrapers.

                  <p>
                    This also presents an interesting position for Reddit, which
                    is banking heavily on AI deals to help it become profitable.

                    Steve Huffman said that he believes Reddit has some of the

                  <p>
                    When asked if he fears "low quality, shallow content
                    generated by AI" will make its way onto Reddit, Huffman
                    answered, in part, that the source of AI is "actual
                    intelligence," and that "there's a general lowering of
                    quality on the internet because more content is written by
                    AI. But I think that actually makes Reddit stand out more as
                    the place where there's all of this human content. What
                    people want is to hear from other people."

                    Not all winged dinosaurs were necessarily capable of full
                    flight, but this anatomical feature may have enabled them to
                    travel further by flapping or gliding
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tiny tracks in South Korea symbolise a moment 120 million
                    years ago when a dinosaur took advantage of its wings to
                    cover ground in large leaps – the oldest track evidence of
                    wing-assisted movement in these extinct

                    Whether the creature, which was a raptor and not part of the
                    lineage that led to birds, took full flight is uncertain.
                    But the tracks support previous ideas that aerodynamics
                    evolved multiple times across prehistoric lines, says

                    “It’s pretty rare to find these kinds of [pre-flight]
                    tracks, and then to find them in an animal that’s not even a
                    bird – that’s pretty special,” he says.

                    Velociraptors and other raptors (dromaeosaurids) are the
                    ancestors of modern birds, but their lineage split into
                    avian and non-avian, or “paravian”, lines about 170 million
                    years ago. Despite having feathers and wings, paravian
                    dinosaurs generally seemed to lack the wingspan needed to
                    offset their body weight, says team member

                      >suspected that some paravian dinosaurs could fly</a
                    >, or at least glide, before full flight evolved in birds,
                    based on muscles in their upper bodies. That suspicion grew
                    stronger as they investigated more than 2600 rows of
                    dinosaur tracks around the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One set of tracks, discovered during the construction of a
                    shopping centre in south-eastern South Korea, showed
                    surprisingly long spacing

                    [...] Further calculations and comparisons with fossil
                    anatomy suggested he was right: the animal could not have
                    made that stride with its legs alone. It was clearly
                    flapping or gliding, possibly while launching or landing,
                    says Pittman.

                    “I think the vast majority of feathered dinosaurs were
                    probably doing what this guy was doing – using the wings to
                    augment running, jumping, braking and turning,” says

                    [...] In September, Ono and two collaborators — William
                    Craig and Jan-Willem van Ittersum — published
                    <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2409417121"

                    for partition identities. Rather than looking for a new
                    source from which these identities would spring, they were
                    able to use them for an entirely different purpose: to
                    detect prime numbers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They took functions that counted partitions and used them to
                    build a special formula. When you plug any prime number into
                    this equation, it spits out zero. When you plug in any other
                    number, it instead spits out a positive number. In this way,
                    the partition identities can give you a way to pick out the
                    entire set of primes from the integers, Ono said. “Isn’t
                    that crazy?”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Partitions are about adding and counting,” he said. “Why
                    would they be able to detect which numbers are prime or not,
                    on the nose, which is a multiplication thing?”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By tapping into the rich mathematical theory of
                    <a
                      href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/behold-modular-forms-the-fifth-fundamental-operation-of-math-20230921/"
                      >modular forms</a
                    >, he and his colleagues found that this formula was just a
                    glimpse of a much larger class of prime-detecting functions
                    — infinitely many, in fact. “That’s mind-blowing to me,” Ono
                    said. “I hope people find it beautiful.” It indicates a
                    deeper relation between the partitions and multiplicative
                    number theory that mathematicians are now hoping to explore.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In some ways, it makes sense that partitions keep
                    infiltrating every corner of mathematics. “The theory of
                    partitions is so basic,” Andrews said. “Counting stuff and
                    adding stuff up happens in almost every branch of
                    mathematics.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the precise nature of those connections is hard to
                    work out. “It’s really about getting the perspective right,”
                    Ono said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “This is the great thing about Ramanujan’s work,” Kanade
                    said. “It’s not just one identity he discovered, and a dead
                    end. It’s always the tip of an iceberg. You just have to
                    follow it through.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Ramanujan is someone who can imagine things that someone
                    like me cannot,” Mourtada said. But the development of new
                    fields of mathematics has “given us the possibility to find
                    new partition identities that Ramanujan could probably have
                    found just by imagination.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “That’s why mathematics is so important,” he added. “It
                    allows ordinary people like me to find these miracles, too.”

                    claiming that locking phones to a carrier's network makes it
                    possible to provide cheaper handsets to consumers. "If the

                    "consumers risk losing access to the benefits of free or
                    heavily subsidized handsets because the proposal would force

                    the FCC judicial deference when interpreting ambiguous laws.
                    The end of Chevron makes it harder for agencies to issue
                    regulations without explicit authorization from Congress.
                    This is a potential problem for the FCC in its fight to

                    Scientists in China have created a mind-bogglingly powerful
                    resistive magnet that has officially broken the world record
                    by sustaining an incredible 42.02 tesla. That is over
                    800,000 times stronger than the magnetic field produced by
                    Earth itself, which has a flux density of about 50
                    microtesla.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new record was set on September 22 at the Steady High
                    Magnetic Field Facility (SHMFF) in Hefei, narrowly edging
                    out the previous record of 41.4 tesla held by another
                    resistive magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Lab in
                    Florida since 2017.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for why scientists are so determined to push the limits
                    of magnetism, physicist Joachim Wosnitza from Germany's
                    Dresden lab
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03382-6"
                      >explained</a
                    >
                    that it opens up all kinds of bizarre new realms of physics
                    to explore. Essentially, the stronger the magnetism, the
                    greater the chances of discovering new states of matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another physicist noted that high magnetism allows
                    scientists to engineer and manipulate entirely new phases of
                    matter that simply don't exist under normal conditions. Each
                    additional tesla achieved also makes instruments
                    exponentially more sensitive for detecting faint phenomena.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The SHMFF's new champion is available for international
                    researchers to test on advanced materials like
                    superconductors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The only drawback of such resistive magnetic systems is that
                    they are real power hogs. The SHMFF's creation consumed a
                    staggering 32.3 megawatts to achieve that record. However,
                    scientists continue to use them because they can sustain
                    high magnetic fields much longer than their newer
                    superconducting counterparts, which eventually reach their
                    limits. The older magnets can also be ramped up quickly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nonetheless, the enormous power requirements are a
                    significant problem. Therefore, teams like those at the
                    SHMFF are also working on hybrid and fully superconducting
                    designs that could achieve extreme strengths while consuming
                    much less energy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is not to say that hybrid or superconducting designs
                    are less powerful than resistive magnetic systems. In fact,
                    China debuted a hybrid resistive/superconducting magnet in
                    2022 that achieved a 45.22 tesla field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the other side of the world, the US National Lab's mini
                    superconducting prototype managed a brief 45.5 tesla burst
                    back in 2019. However, making these new low-power systems
                    reliable and affordable – while also keeping them cool –
                    remains a major technical challenge, underscoring the
                    continued need for resistive magnets.

                Over the coming days and weeks we will be switching servers from
                Linode to our own hardware. The first switch will take place
                tomorrow. This will also require some DNS changes but you just
                keep using the same URLs that you are using today. Other than
                that services should look and behave exactly as they do now.
                There may well be minor disruptions to connections and we ask
                you to please bear with us if they occur. There will be pauses
                of a day or more in between each service being switched over,
                while we continue to monitor that everything is working as
                expected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moving the data from a live server to a new server means that
                there will be a finite time between making a backup and
                installing it on the new server. The site will indicate that
                maintenance is being carried out. That implies that posts made
                during this interval will be lost. The process will begin around
                1600 UTC on Monday 28 October. We will attempt to make the
                switch over as quickly as possible and there should always be a
                live server online. If you lose access to the site completely
                remember that you can still contact us via email ('nickname' [@]
                soylentnews.org), on IRC, or by shouting VERY loudly.

                If your comment is lost please do not believe those in the
                community who will no doubt claim that comments are being

                small number of persistent spammers).
              </p>
              <p>
                Once each switch is completed I would hope that we can inform
                you immediately. However, that might not always be possible -
                everyone has to sleep sometime! Please make any observations
                regarding problems, or even compliments if the system is
                responding better than before, in the comments for this Meta.
                However, our testing so far indicates that the new servers are
                more responsive than the existing servers but of course they
                have not yet been placed under quite the same load.

              <p>
                <b>UPDATE</b>: You should all be accessing the new server.
                Please let us know if you experience any problems. A big

                valley, or got very poor taste in women. It's apparently
                important to note that it is a (or resembles) human female. Not

                does female robots differ from male robots anyway? 0s or 1s ?

                Since it was founded nearly two decades ago, 23andMe has grown
                into one of the largest biotechnology companies in the world.
                Millions of people have used its simple genetic testing service,
                which involves ordering a saliva test, spitting into a tube, and
                sending it back to the company for a detailed DNA analysis.

                    soon and that older browser versions could become a security
                    and usability nightmare in a few months. Starting March 14,
                    2025, Firefox versions older than 128 (ESR 115.13)
                    containing the expired certificate will likely cause
                    "significant" issues with add-ons, content signing, and
                    streaming of DRM-protected media.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Failing to update Firefox before next March means losing
                    features relying on remote functionality. Many installed
                    add-ons will become disabled, and other systems that require
                    content verification could also break. The issue

                    Firefox editions for Android and Windows operating systems,
                    including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Those with iPhone or
                    iPad versions of Firefox should be okay.

                  <p>
                    Mozilla's FAQs explain that a root certificate authenticates
                    browser content as trusted. When a certificate expires,
                    Firefox cannot verify content anymore. The newest versions
                    of Firefox and other Mozilla software using the same
                    root-of-trust model include a new root certificate that will
                    prevent the expiration issue in March 2025.

                  <p>
                    Mozilla is likely trying to prevent the chaos experienced by
                    Firefox users in 2019 when an expired certificate suddenly

                    of users potentially becoming vulnerable to the expiration
                    issue.

                    Some add-on developers have expressed concern over how
                    Mozilla is managing the problem. One developer said Firefox

                    >
                    what could happen on all the affected platforms. Otherwise,
                    disgruntled users could direct their complaints directly to
                    add-on programmers. One-star review bombing campaigns after
                    the certificate expires could also be part of the deal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mozilla advises users to update to Firefox 128 on each
                    device with the browser installed, which is the best
                    practice to avoid this and other issues. The latest release
                    always provides significant performance improvements and
                    important security fixes. Mozilla released Firefox 128 and
                    ESR 115.13 on July 9, 2024, so there have been minor
                    incremental updates since then. The most

                    The final rule adopted by Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden
                    was based on recommendations made by Shira Perlmutter, the
                    register of copyrights and director of the US Copyright
                    Office. The ruling came in the ninth triennial proceeding to
                    determine exemptions under Section 1201 of the Digital
                    Millennium Copyright Act. The process provides exemptions
                    for the next three years to "the prohibition against
                    circumvention of technological measures that effectively
                    control access to copyrighted works."

                    commercial food preparation equipment because proponents
                    sufficiently showed, by a preponderance of the evidence,

                Opposition to the change came from McDonalds corporate and the

                Entertainment Software Association, Motion Picture Association,

                    activity and enable businesses to better serve their
                    customers," Rose said. "While we are disappointed that the
                    Register recommended a narrower exemption than we had
                    proposed, this does not soften our enthusiasm. We will
                    continue to chip away at half-baked laws blocking the right

                    There are multiple settings that phone users must choose to
                    close off the constant leaking of their locations. For users
                    of either Android or iOS, the first step is to audit which
                    apps currently have permission to access the device
                    location. This can be done on Android by accessing Settings
                    &gt; Location &gt; App location permissions and, on iOS,
                    Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services.

                  <p>
                    For most users, there's usefulness in allowing an app for
                    photos, transit, or maps to access a user's precise
                    location. For other classes of apps—say those for Internet
                    jukeboxes at bars and restaurants—it can be helpful for them
                    to have an approximate location, but giving them precise,
                    fine-grained access is likely overkill. And for other apps,
                    there's no reason for them ever to know the device's
                    location. With a few exceptions, there's little reason for
                    apps to always have location access.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not surprisingly, Android users who want to block intrusive
                    location gathering have more settings to change than iOS
                    users. The first thing to do is access Settings &gt;
                    Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Ads and choose "Delete
                    advertising ID." Then, promptly ignore the long, scary
                    warning Google provides and hit the button confirming the
                    decision at the bottom. If you don't see that setting, good
                    for you. It means you already deleted it. Google provides

                    "Very few Yugoslavians had access to computers in the early
                    1980s: they were mostly the preserve of large institutions
                    or companies. Importing home computers like the Commodore 64
                    was not only expensive, but also legally impossible, thanks
                    to a law that restricted regular citizens from importing
                    individual goods that were worth more than 50 Deutsche Marks
                    (the Commodore 64 cost over 1,000 Deutsche Marks at launch).
                    Even if someone in Yugoslavia could afford the latest home
                    computers, they would have to resort to smuggling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1983, engineer Vojislav "Voja" Antonić was becoming more
                    and more frustrated with the senseless Yugoslavian import
                    laws.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Antonić was pondering this while on holiday with his wife in
                    Risan in Montenegro in 1983. "I was thinking how would it be
                    possible to make the simplest and cheapest possible
                    computer," says Antonić. "As a way to amuse myself in my
                    free time. That's it. Everyone thinks it is an interesting
                    story, but really I was just bored!" He wondered whether it
                    would be possible to make a computer without a graphics chip
                    – or a "video controller" as they were commonly known at the
                    time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead of having a separate graphics chip, Antonić thought
                    he could use part of the CPU to generate a video signal, and
                    then replicate some of the other video functions using
                    software. It would mean sacrificing processing power, but in
                    principle it was possible, and it would make the computer
                    much cheaper."

                  <p>
                    German air-taxi developer Lilium said on Thursday two of its
                    subsidiaries in the country have decided to file for
                    insolvency following unsuccessful talks with state and
                    federal governments to solve its cash crisis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company's U.S.-listed shares fell 57% to 23 cents after
                    the subsidiaries - Lilium GmbH and Lilium eAircraft GmbH -
                    told the parent they are over-indebted and will be unable to
                    pay debts over the coming days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lilium is now "reviewing whether there are grounds for its
                    own insolvency as well," it said in a regulatory filing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company, among a handful of air-taxi makers that are
                    seeking to upend urban travel, was staring at a cash crunch
                    as it is still developing aircraft that is yet to receive
                    approval to carry passengers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lilium had asked the German federal government to guarantee
                    50 million euros ($54 million) of a contemplated 100 million
                    euro convertible loan from KfW, the German state-owned
                    development bank.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the company received indications that the federal
                    government would not approve it, Lilium said. Talks with
                    Bavaria, where Lilium is based, for guarantee of at least 50
                    million euros have not yielded an agreement so far.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The filing for insolvency in Germany could result in the
                    company's ordinary shares being delisted from the Nasdaq, or
                    having its shares suspended, Lilium said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Founded in 2015, Lilium is targeting the regional transport
                    market with a 250 kilometer-range (155 miles) jet that can
                    carry up to six passengers, unlike many rivals which are
                    mainly looking at shorter trips between cities and suburbs.

                    A long-lost story from Bram Stoker, the Irish author of one
                    of the world's best known gothic horror stories 'Dracula',
                    has been found in Dublin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a remarkable discovery, the short story by Stoker, has
                    been unearthed 130 years after it was first printed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The haunting tale, titled 'Gibbet Hill', was found in the
                    1890 Christmas supplement of the Dublin Daily Express.

              <p>It's almost as if Halloween was upon us soon ... oh right.</p>
              <p>
                If it was printed, and then forgotten about (or lost) for 130
                years. How good can it really be? This is around the time he
                also wrote 'Dracula'. Considering it was a bit of a hit it seems
                odd that his other writing was then lost. Did they work contrary
                to how writers work today that if they make one hit then all
                their other writings become "gold" and are reprinted or
                rereleased etc etc.

                This isn't really tech-centric but, sadly, it reflects on the

                    [...] this new twist belongs to one county in Texas, which
                    has given certain people the power to unilaterally decide
                    what is or isn't factual.
                  </p>
                  <ul>

                        [A] decision made this month in a county near Houston
                        left us stunned. The Montgomery County Commissioners
                        Court ordered librarians there to reclassify the
                        nonfiction children's book "Colonization and the
                        Wampanoag Story" as fiction.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        This reclassification decision is a consequence of a
                        contentious policy change in March. Right-wing activists
                        pressured the Montgomery County Commissioners Court to
                        remove librarians from the review process for challenged
                        children's, young adult and parenting books.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        [...] Shortly thereafter, the newly formed Montgomery
                        County "Citizens Review Committee" reclassified
                        "Colonization and the Wampanoag Story" as fiction. The
                        committee reviewed the book in a closed meeting — all
                        its meetings are closed to the public — and it offered
                        no explanation for its decision. The new policy does not
                        allow decisions made by the Citizens Review Committee to
                        be appealed.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    That's how you start erasing your own history. You take the
                    librarians out of the equation. Next, you remove the public
                    from the conversation by making these discussions private.
                    Then you give only the citizens you want to hear from —
                    including any non-residents who want to challenge content
                    they don't like — the only invitation to the discussion: the
                    blanket permission to challenge books and/or their
                    classifications. Then you seal it with a court order and
                    pretend this is just citizens protecting each other, rather
                    than the government engaging in censorship on behalf of
                    people who love censorship as long as it only silences the
                    people they don't like.

                    The challenges don't stop there. Hertz's heavy debt load is
                    tying its hands, potentially forcing the company to navigate
                    choppy waters without the lifeline of share buybacks. With
                    used-vehicle prices on shaky ground and high refinancing
                    costs, Hertz is bracing for more cash outflows. Throw in a
                    recent adverse court ruling that resurrected litigation
                    risks from its bankruptcy, and the financial landscape looks
                    even more daunting. The path to stability isn't just steep;
                    it's laden with obstacles.

                    But it's not just China making moves. The US semiconductor
                    industry, propped up by the Inflation Reduction Act, saw its
                    own patent filings rise by 9 percent, reaching 21,269 in
                    2023-24. With US policies pouring cash into domestic chip
                    production – TSMC's Arizona plant being one high-profile
                    example – the US is keen to keep its supply chain fortified
                    while ramping up its R&amp;D efforts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's not clear whether the current patent push will result
                    in feature parity or processor independence for China in the
                    next several years. Both the US and China are seeking to
                    bring fabrication of sub-10nm nodes to their own turf, and
                    the US Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) predicted in
                    a report out earlier this year that the US would be a bigger
                    winner by far. SIA
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/08/us_china_sia/"
                      >predicted</a
                    >
                    that by 2032, the US would produce 28 percent of the world's
                    advanced processors, compared to just 2 percent from China.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    China's patent surge isn't solely driven by geopolitics. The
                    rise of AI, and particularly the explosion of generative AI,
                    has sparked a push to innovate in semiconductor design. AI
                    accelerators and high-performance chips are hot commodities,
                    and chipmakers everywhere are scrambling to file patents for
                    the next big thing in AI hardware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So while global semiconductor patents are on the rise,
                    China's 42 percent leap is an indication that it's gunning
                    for self-sufficiency. But as the US shores up its own
                    chipmaking prowess, the race is on – and it's only set to
                    intensify if current trends are anything to go by. ®

                About a dozen developers based in Russia have been removed in a
                commit by Greg Kroah-Hartman to the Linux Kernel MAINTAINERS
                file, Phoronix reports:

                  >https://www.phoronix.com/news/Russian-Linux-Maintainers-Drop</a
                >. The reason given for the removal is vague: "Remove some
                entries due to various compliance requirements."

                Controversial Linux VLogger Bryan Lunduke reports that this has
                happened due to US presidential executive order 14071, which
                sanctions IT collaborations with Russian residents (<a

                Linus himself backed the actions, The Register quotes him with
                "I'm Finnish. Did you think I'd be *supporting* Russian
                aggression?"

                This will likely have far reaching consequences, going vastly
                beyond the Linux kernel, with any FLOSS organization in the US
                or under direct US influence having to ban Russian contributors
                before the end of the year.

                    [...] <br />The main evidence presented by Hoback in support
                    of the theory that Todd created Bitcoin is a forum thread
                    from December 2010 in which Todd appears to be "finishing
                    Satoshi's sentences," as Hoback puts it. The topic of that
                    thread—a way to prioritize transactions based on the fee
                    paid—is something Todd would later go on to build into
                    Bitcoin as a contributing developer, responding to a request
                    posted by another forum user, John Dillon, whom Hoback
                    alleges to be another of Todd's alter egos.<br />[...]<br />It
                    was Todd's reaction to being confronted with the theory that
                    ultimately solidified Hoback's conviction in the conclusion
                    he had reached. "The end scene is really about his body
                    language—his expressions. Were you ever caught in a lie?
                    That's what Peter's reaction reads like to me," says
                    Hoback.<br />[...]<br />"[Todd] throws so much shit at the
                    wall that nothing sticks," alleges Hoback. "It's a pretty
                    effective technique—it's hard to pin down someone who's a
                    contrarian and constantly makes opposite statements." (Todd
                    rejects Hoback's assessment as "wooly conspiracy
                    thinking.")<br />[...]<br />"If you assume a sophisticated
                    enough Satoshi, practically any theory is possible," says
                    Todd. "It's a useless question, because Satoshi would simply
                    deny it."

                    Police use of automated license-plate reader cameras is
                    being challenged in a lawsuit alleging that the cameras
                    enable warrantless surveillance in violation of the Fourth
                    Amendment. The city of Norfolk, Virginia, was sued yesterday
                    by plaintiffs represented by the Institute for Justice, a
                    nonprofit public-interest law firm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Norfolk, a city with about 238,000 residents, "has installed
                    a network of cameras that make it functionally impossible
                    for people to drive anywhere without having their movements
                    tracked, photographed, and stored in an AI-assisted database
                    that enables the warrantless surveillance of their every
                    move. This civil rights lawsuit seeks to end this dragnet
                    surveillance program," said the complaint filed in US
                    District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like many other cities, Norfolk uses cameras made by the
                    company Flock Safety. A 404 Media article said Institute for
                    Justice lawyer Robert Frommer "told 404 Media that the
                    lawsuit could have easily been filed in any of the more than
                    5,000 communities where Flock is active, but that Norfolk
                    made sense because the Fourth Circuit of Appeals—which
                    Norfolk is part of—recently held that persistent,
                    warrantless drone surveillance in Baltimore is
                    unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment in a case called
                    Beautiful Struggle v Baltimore Police Department."

                    other species that have gone extinct relatively recently:

                      >the thylacine</a
                    >. Because of significant differences in biology, not the
                    least of which is the generation time of Proboscideans,
                    these other efforts may reach many critical milestones well
                    in advance of the work on mammoths.<br />[...]<br />Colossal
                    has branched out from its original de-extinction mission to
                    include efforts to keep species from ever needing its
                    services. In the case of marsupial predators, the
                    de-extinction effort is incorporating work that will benefit
                    existing marsupial predators: generating resistance to the
                    toxins found on the cane toad, an invasive species that has
                    spread widely across Australia.<br />[...]<br />For the
                    de-extinction process, the goal would be to ensure that the
                    thylacine could survive in the presence of the cane toad.
                    But Colossal has also begun a conservation effort, called
                    the Colossal foundation, that aims to keep threatened
                    species from needing its services in the future.<br />[...]<br />Colossal
                    has obtained a nearly complete genome sequence from a
                    thylacine sample that was preserved in ethanol a bit over a
                    century ago. According to Pask, this sample contains both
                    the short fragments typical of older DNA samples (typically
                    just a few hundred base pairs long), but also some DNA
                    molecules that were above 10,000 bases long. This allowed
                    them to do both short- and long-read sequencing, leaving
                    them with just 45 gaps in the total genome sequence, which
                    the team expects to close shortly.<br />[...]<br />The final
                    thing the company announced was that it was working on
                    getting dunnart embryos to develop outside of the womb.<br />[...]<br />At
                    this point, they've got immature neural cells and have
                    started forming the cells that will go on to form muscles
                    and the vertebrae. But many critical events need to happen
                    in the remaining one-third of the pregnancy, and Colossal
                    isn't ready to talk about what goes wrong to stop
                    development here.<br />[...]<br />Hopefully, over time, the
                    company will continue to submit some of its work to
                    peer-reviewed journals.

                    In the meantime, the clear indications of progress suggest
                    that some of the unique features of the
                    marsupials—relatively rapid generation times, accessible
                    reproductive system, and many similarities to well-studied
                    placental mammals—are helping this project move ahead at a
                    reasonably rapid clip.

                    [...] The combined results also speak to a more fundamental
                    goal. For decades, the quantum computing community has been

                    — a task that quantum computers can do that a classical one
                    would struggle with. Usually, researchers understand quantum
                    advantage to mean that a quantum computer can do the task in
                    far fewer steps.

                  <p>
                    The new papers show that quantum memory lets a quantum
                    computer perform a task not necessarily with fewer steps,
                    but with less data. As a result, researchers believe this in
                    itself could be a way to prove quantum advantage. “It allows
                    us to, in the more near term, already achieve that kind of
                    quantum advantage,” said

                    But researchers are excited about the practical benefits
                    too, as the new results make it easier for researchers to
                    understand complex quantum systems.

                    experienced invasive hacking of their devices by individuals
                    who took physical control of the cleaning bots and used
                    their internal audio features to shout racial slurs at
                    people in their homes. Owners first heard garbled voices
                    coming from their devices, then noticed the vacuum's live
                    feed camera and remote controls were turned on via the
                    device's app.

                  <p>
                    All of the affected devices were manufactured by brand
                    Ecovac, specifically the company's Deebot X2 model. The hack
                    was confirmed to one customer after they filed a complaint

                    Smart devices have long worried security experts and users
                    for their potential vulnerabilities. In August, cyber
                    security researchers uncovered multiple vulnerabilities in
                    Ecovacs products (including lawn mowers) that could allow
                    hackers to take control of microphones and cameras via
                    mobile Bluetooth connections — to put it simply, researchers
                    concluded the company's security was "really, really,
                    really, really bad."

                    could be easily switched off.
