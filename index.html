                    that The New York Times was considering joining the growing
                    legion of creators that are suing AI companies for
                    misappropriating their content. The Times had reportedly
                    been negotiating with OpenAI regarding the potential to
                    license its material, but those talks had not gone smoothly.
                    So, eight months after the company was reportedly
                    considering suing,
                    <a
                      href="https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf"
                      >the suit has now been filed</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Times is targeting various companies under the OpenAI
                    umbrella, as well as Microsoft, an OpenAI partner that both
                    uses it to power its Copilot service and helped provide the
                    infrastructure for training the GPT Large Language Model.
                    But the suit goes well beyond the use of copyrighted
                    material in training, alleging that OpenAI-powered software
                    will happily circumvent the Times' paywall and ascribe
                    hallucinated misinformation to the Times.
                  </p>
                  <p><i>Journalism is expensive</i></p>
                  <p>
                    The suit notes that The Times maintains a large staff that
                    allows it to do things like dedicate reporters to a huge
                    range of beats and engage in important investigative
                    journalism, among other things. Because of those
                    investments, the newspaper is often considered an
                    authoritative source on many matters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All of that costs money, and The Times earns that by
                    limiting access to its reporting through a robust paywall.
                    In addition, each print edition has a copyright
                    notification, the Times' terms of service limit the copying
                    and use of any published material, and it can be selective
                    about how it licenses its stories. In addition to driving
                    revenue, these restrictions also help it to maintain its
                    reputation as an authoritative voice by controlling how its
                    works appear.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The suit alleges that OpenAI-developed tools undermine all
                    of that. "By providing Times content without The Times's
                    permission or authorization, Defendants' tools undermine and
                    damage The Times's relationship with its readers and deprive
                    The Times of subscription, licensing, advertising, and
                    affiliate revenue," the suit alleges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Part of the unauthorized use The Times alleges came during
                    the training of various versions of GPT. Prior to GPT-3.5,
                    information about the training dataset was made public. One
                    of the sources used is a large collection of online material
                    called "Common Crawl," which the suit alleges contains
                    information from 16 million unique records from sites
                    published by The Times. That places the Times as the third
                    most references source, behind Wikipedia and a database of
                    US patents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    OpenAI no longer discloses as many details of the data used
                    for training of recent GPT versions, but all indications are
                    that full-text NY Times articles are still part of that
                    process. [...] Expect access to training information to be a
                    major issue during discovery if this case moves forward.

                    the material ingested during training can come back out
                    during use. "Defendants' GenAI tools can generate output
                    that recites Times content verbatim, closely summarizes it,
                    and mimics its expressive style, as demonstrated by scores
                    of examples," the suit alleges.

                    Axon CEO Rick Smith claims his highly successful Taser
                    company was inspired by the death of two school friends
                    gunned down years ago. But much of the tale is false,
                    Reuters found, part of a pattern of misrepresentations and
                    self-serving behavior among top Axon executives.<br />...<br />He
                    started the company, he said, after "two of my high school
                    friends were shot and killed." Projected behind him were
                    photographs of the slain youths, marked with the dates of
                    their short lives.<br />...<br />Smith was not friends with
                    the deceased, Todd Bogers and Cory Holmes, according to
                    three immediate family members and a close friend of the
                    young men. They were gunned down after a road rage incident
                    in 1991, not 1990, as indicated on Smith's slide in Las
                    Vegas. Smith played on the same football team as the boys at
                    Chaparral in Scottsdale, Arizona – but not at the same time,
                    according to school yearbooks seen by Reuters. The boys who
                    were killed graduated in 1986. Smith does not appear in the
                    yearbooks until the school year that ended in 1987.<br />Axon
                    "ran a whole advertising campaign based on the murder of my
                    son," Todd's father John Bogers said in an interview,
                    recalling feelings of bereavement that the ads triggered.
                    "They profited off that, and they didn't ask for
                    permission."<br />...<br />Shelby Bogers and Christopher
                    Holmes, siblings of the football players Todd and Cory, said
                    the story came as news to them: They did not learn about
                    Smith's narrative until more than 15 years after their
                    brothers' deaths, they said.
                    <b
                      >Smith wasn't close with Todd or Cory, didn't attend their
                      joint funeral and never offered a hand during the

                    >
                    Shelby Bogers said. Now Axon is "calling them his childhood
                    friends," she said. "That word pisses me off."<br />...<br />Smith's
                    wife ...was employed by the company in the role of "CEO

                    [...] It is important to note that, despite the hype, to
                    exploit these vulnerabilities it is necessary to have access
                    to the system in the first place, and in that access, to
                    have privileges to write to the EFI partition and UEFI
                    non-volatile ram (nvram). The keen-eyed reader will realize
                    that, if you already have that level of access, then it's
                    not necessarily the LogoFAIL exploit itself that is the
                    problem, but rather the persistence that it enables for
                    other malware to abuse. Consider, for example, a ransomware
                    that persists even system reimaging attempts after an
                    infrastructure-wide attack. It would cripple recovery
                    operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Adding insult to injury, the vulnerabilities exist across
                    multiple platforms and architectures. It impacts both x86
                    and ARM-based devices. BIOS vendors like AMI, Phoenix, and
                    others, create firmware that is affected by LogoFAIL. In
                    turn, this makes motherboards using that firmware to also be
                    affected by it – it doesn't matter if server-grade or
                    consumer-grade hardware, as the same BIOS vendors will
                    provide software for all of them. Vendors like Intel, Dell,
                    Supermicro, Acer, and many others are therefore affected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These findings highlight another dimension of software
                    supply chain risks. Directly targeting hardware adds to the
                    already complex array of threats affecting software supply
                    chains, from developer tools to source code repositories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fact that a given workload is potentially affected by
                    vulnerabilities all throughout this large dependency and
                    environment chain is something that we seem to turn a blind
                    eye to – either through a lack of awareness or an inability
                    to effectively prevent it – but which doesn't make it any
                    more secure.

                    Hundreds of Windows and Linux computer models from virtually
                    all hardware makers are vulnerable to a new attack that
                    executes malicious firmware early in the boot-up sequence, a
                    feat that allows infections that are nearly impossible to
                    detect or remove using current defense mechanisms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The attack—dubbed LogoFAIL by the researchers who devised
                    it—is notable for the relative ease in carrying it out, the
                    breadth of both consumer- and enterprise-grade models that
                    are susceptible, and the high level of control it gains over
                    them. In many cases, LogoFAIL can be remotely executed in
                    post-exploit situations using techniques that can't be
                    spotted by traditional endpoint security products. And
                    because exploits run during the earliest stages of the boot
                    process, they are able to bypass a host of defenses,
                    including the industry-wide Secure Boot, Intel's Secure
                    Boot, and similar protections from other companies that are
                    devised to prevent so-called bootkit infections.
                  </p>
                  <p>Game over for platform security</p>
                  <p>
                    LogoFAIL is a constellation of two dozen newly discovered
                    vulnerabilities that have lurked for years, if not decades,
                    in Unified Extensible Firmware Interfaces responsible for
                    booting modern devices that run Windows or Linux. The
                    vulnerabilities are the product of almost a year's worth of
                    work by Binarly, a firm that helps customers identify and
                    secure vulnerable firmware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As its name suggests, LogoFAIL involves logos,
                    specifically those of the hardware seller that are displayed
                    on the device screen early in the boot process, while the
                    UEFI is still running. Image parsers in UEFIs from all three
                    major IBVs are riddled with roughly a dozen critical
                    vulnerabilities that have gone unnoticed until now. By
                    replacing the legitimate logo images with identical-looking
                    ones that have been specially crafted to exploit these bugs,
                    LogoFAIL makes it possible to execute malicious code at the
                    most sensitive stage of the boot process, which is known as
                    DXE, short for Driver Execution Environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Once arbitrary code execution is achieved during the DXE
                    phase, it's game over for platform security," researchers
                    from Binarly, the security firm that discovered the
                    vulnerabilities, wrote in a whitepaper. "From this stage, we
                    have full control over the memory and the disk of the target
                    device, thus including the operating system that will be
                    started."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From there, LogoFAIL can deliver a second-stage payload that
                    drops an executable onto the hard drive before the main OS
                    has even started.

                    IT security teams are assessing new UEFI vulnerabilities
                    that affect Windows and Linux systems. The vulnerabilities
                    are collectively called LogoFAIL because they exist in UEFI
                    image parsers that display the manufacturer logo when the
                    system boots up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Affected vendors include UEFI suppliers AMI, Insyde, and
                    Phoenix and device manufacturers such as Lenovo, Dell, and
                    HP. Some vendors have already issued advisories, but we
                    should expect the list to expand as more vendors assess
                    their exposure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Defenders need to know which systems are affected by
                    LogoFAIL vulnerabilities and the associated severity. The
                    CERT Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon has
                    <a href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/811862"
                      >a dynamic list of affected vendors</a
                    >
                    and associated security advisories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So far, it is difficult to determine the severity as no
                    public exploit has been published, and some of the now
                    public vulnerabilities have been scored differently by the
                    researchers from Binarly who discovered the LogoFAIL
                    vulnerabilities, the UEFI firmware vendors (Phoenix
                    Technologies, Insyde, and AMI), and the National
                    Vulnerability Database (NVD). The severity and
                    exploitability of each LogoFAIL vulnerability will likely
                    depend on how affected firmware vendors and equipment
                    manufacturers (OEMs) store and process logo images. An
                    attacker's ability to modify these logo images or paths to
                    them may depend on malicious software running locally on a
                    system (with administrative or root-level privileges), by an
                    attacker remotely accessing the system, or by an attacker
                    who gained physical access to a target.

                    8.2 (High). The difference in CVSS score appears to result
                    from differences in perceived potential impact on
                    confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

                    The severity rating for the AMI vulnerabilities is higher
                    than the CVE in Insyde firmware due to stated impact on
                    confidentiality and integrity.

                    are flowing uphill, we calculated what the stresses are that
                    cause them to move in that direction. If you have a negative
                    angle of repose, then you must have cohesion to give a
                    negative coefficient of friction. These granular flow
                    equations were never derived to consider these things, but
                    after calculating it, what came out is an apparent
                    coefficient of friction that is negative.”

                    It's an intriguing proof of principle that could one day
                    lead to new ways to control how substances mix or separate,
                    as well as potential swarming microrobotics applications.
                    The scientists have already started building tiny staircases
                    with laser cutters and videotaping the micro-rollers
                    climbing up and down the other. One micro-roller can't
                    overcome the height of each step, but many working
                    collectively can do so, per Gilchrist.

                    Python's been around in one form or another for over 30
                    years. Over that time, it has accumulated a wide and
                    powerful set of modules in its standard library. These
                    modules help developers get started with many common tasks.

                    But over the years, some of those batteries have
                    died—meaning they've gone out of maintenance, or been used
                    for technologies that are now obsolete. Some of these "dead

                    Reindeer appear to snooze throughout the day while chewing
                    their cud. This may be an adaptation to their Arctic
                    habitat, where food is abundant in the summer and they must
                    constantly eat to gain enough weight to survive the winter.

                    ruminate – that is, they regurgitate food from their stomach
                    back into their mouth for extra chewing. And they often take
                    on a trance-like stare as they chomp. “You can sort of see
                    it in their face, they’re a bit gone,” says
                    <a href="https://www.nibio.no/en/employees/gabriela-wagner"

                    at the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research. “But
                    nobody knew if they were actually asleep because no one has
                    ever measured the brainwaves of reindeer before.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wagner and her colleagues used an electroencephalograph
                    (EEG) – metal electrodes attached to the heads of four
                    captive Eurasian tundra reindeer (Rangifer tarandus
                    tarandus), which recorded electrical pulses in their brains
                    over the next few days as they ate, slept and moved around.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The reindeer's brainwave patterns revealed that, when
                    ruminating, they were in a light stage of sleep known as
                    non-REM sleep, suggesting the animals can recharge while
                    chewing their cud. "It looks very much like human sleep –
                    it's got the same stages of sleep spindles and slow wave
                    activity," says Wagner, describing bursts of brain activity
                    visible on the EEG. They also found that the more time the
                    reindeer spent ruminating, the less they needed additional
                    rest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Resting while ruminating may also explain why, unlike
                    most other species that sleep more in winter, reindeer
                    appear to sleep the same amount regardless of the season.

                    Google faces yet another looming threat as it awaits a
                    judge’s ruling on the Justice Department case

                    appearance by Page and Brin, who created Google’s search
                    tool and held top executive roles as it rose to market
                    dominance.

                  <p>
                    Instead, Justice Department’s antitrust lawyers grilled a
                    number of current and former executives on Google’s payroll
                    — as well as higher-ups from firms like Apple and Microsoft.

                  <p>
                    One prominent industry source who has been tracking the
                    proceedings described the Justice Department’s decision not
                    to call the founders to the stand as a “tactical mistake.”
                    The source argued the feds missed an opportunity to grill
                    the notoriously reclusive Page – an enigmatic figure who
                    former friend Elon Musk once

                    [...] The co-founders’ physical absence from the search
                    trial, while notable and surprising to some outsiders, may
                    have made more sense for federal antitrust lawyers aiming to
                    build a laser-focused case about Google’s search business
                    practices, experts told The Post.

                    “In a case that’s already 10 weeks long, you really want to
                    walk the line between providing enough information and
                    carrying your burden of proof as the government and dragging
                    on and boring the judge,” said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, an
                    antitrust law expert and professor at Vanderbilt Law School.

                    “Especially when it’s a bench trial, you don’t want to be in
                    a situation where you’re putting irrelevant proof. You have
                    to pick and choose your strongest witnesses,” Allensworth
                    added.

                    There are only a handful of trusted end-to-end encrypted
                    email providers. Of those, Tuta (which has long been known
                    as "Tutanota" but recently rebranded ) is one of the more
                    well-known. This week, the company found itself on the
                    defensive after being labeled a "front" for law enforcement
                    and intelligence services. In an attempt to clear its name,
                    the company released a statement denying that it's a
                    honeypot operation, after a former, highly placed Canadian
                    intelligence official alleged in court that was the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cop in question, Cameron Ortis, formerly ran a "highly
                    secret unit" within the Royal Canadian Mountain Police, but
                    is now on trial for allegedly having attempted to sell
                    government intelligence to criminals, CBC reports.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ortis has denied that he was actually attempting to sell
                    state secrets. In his testimony, which was made public this
                    week, Ortis instead said that he was involved in a special
                    operation. As part of that operation, agents used Tuta,
                    which he described as a "storefront"—or a kind of
                    honeypot—to lure in prospective criminals for surveillance,
                    he said. CBC describes the former government official's
                    allegations like this:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        ...according to Ortis, [another agent] briefed him about
                        a "storefront" that was being created to attract
                        criminal targets to an online encryption service. A
                        storefront, said Ortis, is a fake business or entity,
                        either online or bricks-and-mortar, set up by police or
                        intelligence agencies. The plan, he said, was to have
                        criminals use the storefront — an online end-to-end
                        encryption service called Tutanota — to allow
                        authorities to collect intelligence about them.

                  <p>
                    "So if targets begin to use that service, the agency that's
                    collecting that information would be able to feed it back,
                    that information, into the Five Eyes system, and then back
                    into the RCMP," Ortis claimed, in reference to the Five Eyes
                    intelligence-sharing alliance, of which Canada is a
                    prominent member. Ortis has claimed that some unnamed Five
                    Eyes foreign agent introduced him to the honeypot operation
                    and that he didn't notify his superiors at the RCMP about
                    it. Follow-up questions about the whole thing have mostly
                    led him to say things like "I don't recall," and "that's
                    something I can't talk about."

                Some of you will have enjoyed a good meal over Christmas,
                perhaps also at Thanksgiving if you are an American. It possibly
                included potatoes in some form; mashed, boiled, roasted, baked
                or in some other form of cooking. You would have probably
                considered them a vegetable. But the US Dietary Guidelines
                Advisory Committee is planning to change that.

                    What an insult to potatoes everywhere. The US Dietary
                    Guidelines Advisory Committee is expected in 2025 to declare
                    that potatoes aren't actually vegetables and instead will
                    lump them in with grains and rice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic
                    Research Service, the primary vegetables consumed by
                    Americans are potatoes and tomatoes. In 2019, the average
                    American consumed nearly 50 pounds of potatoes and
                    approximately 31 pounds of tomatoes throughout the year.

                    not grounded in any scientific metric," Kam Quarles, CEO of
                    the National Potato Council, testified at a Dietary
                    Guidelines Advisory Committee meeting. "This unsupported
                    notion, if acted upon, will confuse consumers, could result
                    in nutrient gaps and also decreased vegetable consumption.
                    We ask the Committee to avoid this chaotic outcome and
                    continue to acknowledge the fact that potatoes are a
                    vegetable."

                Do you agree with this reclassification? Should the same 'logic'
                be applied to other root vegetables which today are commonly
                thought to be correctly described already? Parsnips, beet, sweet
                potato, onion, etc. Or is this a case of a government body
                thinking that it must make changes to justify its existence?

                  <p>Chips are not getting cheaper.</p>
                  <p>
                    Increasingly sophisticated wafer fab tools are needed to
                    produce chips on leading-edge process technologies, thus
                    intensifying costs with each new node. Analysts from
                    International Business Strategies believe that the situation
                    will worsen at 2nm, with chip costs growing by around 50%
                    compared to 3nm processors, reports <a
                      href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/The-great-nanometer-chip-race"
                      >Nikkei</a
                    >, ultimately resulting in a $30,000 price tag for each
                    wafer of 2nm chips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    IBS estimates that a 2nm-capable fab with a capacity of
                    roughly 50,000 wafer starts per month (WSPM) costs around
                    $28 billion, up from around $20 billion for a 3nm fab with a
                    similar production capacity. The cost increase will be
                    driven by the increased number of EUV litho tools required
                    to maintain a 50,000 WSPM capacity for a 2nm-class
                    technology. This will significantly increase production
                    costs per wafer and per chip, which will inevitably affect
                    companies that use leading-edge fabrication technologies,
                    such as Apple, which is currently the only company that mass
                    produces processors for smartphones and PCs using TSMC's
                    latest N3B (3nm-class fabrication process). 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, IBS seems to be a little dramatic with its
                    per-chip cost estimate. The company believes that Apple's
                    current 3nm per-chip cost is around $50, but it does not
                    define the chip's die size. <a

                    > estimates that Apple's latest A17 Pro system-on-chip for
                    smartphones has a die size between 100mm^2 and 110mm^2,
                    which is in line with die sizes of the company's
                    previous-generation A15 (<a
                      href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/apple-a15-die-shot-and-annotation"
                      >107.7mm^2</a
                    >) and A16 (around 5% larger than A15, so, approximately <a
                      href="https://www.eetasia.com/express/techinsights-2023062973/"
                      >113mm^2</a
                    >) SoCs. If Apple's A17 Pro has a die size of 105mm^2, then
                    one 300-mm wafer can fit 586 of these, which brings their
                    cost to approximately $34 at an unrealistic 100% yield and
                    $40 at a more realistic 85% yield.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Even with very rough estimates about 2nm fab costs and
                    wafer costs, it is clear that chips made using a 2nm node
                    will be more expensive than processors produced on a
                    3nm-class process technology. That said, expect companies
                    like AMD and Intel to accelerate the adoption of
                    multi-chipset designs comprised of chiplets made on
                    different nodes in the coming years, thus defraying the
                    costs associated with leading-edge nodes. Meanwhile, it is
                    likely that smartphone processors will retain monolithic
                    designs for a while as advanced packaging costs are still
                    quite high.

                    Qualcomm and four other significant semiconductor firms have
                    officially joined forces to establish Quintauris, a company
                    focused on developing "next-generation hardware" based on
                    the RISC-V open-standard architecture (via

                      >Business Wire</a
                    >). The self-stated mission of Quintauris is to provide a
                    single source for enabling RISC-V devices and promote
                    standards for the RISC-V industry, which has been criticized
                    for being prone to fragmentation.

                    RISC-V is an open-standard (or open-source, depending on who
                    you ask) instruction set architecture (ISA) for CPUs that
                    was first established in 2014, and is maintained by RISC-V
                    International. The basic premise for RISC-V is that any
                    company can take the ISA and make their own CPUs, bypassing
                    the closed ecosystems of Arm, AMD, and Intel. Since its
                    debut, RISC-V has grown extremely quickly, with

                    Qualcomm is invested in the production of Arm
                    architecture-based chips, so it might seem unintuitive for
                    the company to get into RISC-V too. However, Qualcomm has
                    actually been using RISC-V for five years for its
                    microcontrollers, as have many other companies. Qualcomm is
                    also using RISC-V for its

                    is what RISC means), RISC-V is inherently minimalistic, and
                    it's found a niche in small chips.

                    [...] According to its
                    <a href="https://www.quintauris.eu/">official website</a>,
                    Quintauris says its products will initially focus on the
                    automotive industry and then later cater to mobile and
                    Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The company is also
                    focused on promoting standards for the RISC-V
                    hardware-software ecosystem, and the implication appears to
                    be that the launch of successful products developed by
                    several big companies will help realize standardization.

                    Quintauris isn't the only organization seeking to inject
                    standards into the world of RISC-V however, as there is also

                    The publication says this duel has “raised questions in
                    Washington about whether Apple has used its market dominance
                    over iMessage to block competition and force consumers to
                    spend more on iPhones than lower-priced alternatives.”

                    People familiar with the matter told the Justice
                    Department’s antitrust lawyer met with Eric Migicovsky, the
                    co-founder of Beeper, about this possible anticompetitive
                    behavior by Apple. At the same time, the FTC posted in its
                    blog that it would scrutinize “dominant” players that “use
                    privacy and security as a justification to disallow
                    interoperability” between services.

                    Although ultimately, this fight has more to do with
                    Americans being used to texting through the Messages app
                    instead of WhatsApp, Telegram, or another alternative, the
                    government is worried about anticompetitive behavior from
                    Apple, as it has been questioning the company about the App
                    Store, Apple Pay monopoly, and so on.

                Multiple sites are reporting from Reuters that new digital

                estimated 480 million kg of otherwise viable desktops and

                    Multiple key barriers prevent Windows 10-compatible PCs from
                    running Windows 10, including a need for a 64-bit processor
                    listed by Microsoft as a 'supported CPU,' at least 4 GB of
                    RAM, a minimum of 64GB storage, and UEFI firmware with
                    Secure Boot capability instead of the older BIOS.
                    Additionally, a crucial requirement is TPM version 2.0 for
                    enhanced

                    >, which supersedes the TPM 1.2 version supported by some
                    Windows 10 devices. In addition, Windows 11 also demands a

                    12-compatible GPU with a WDDM 2.x driver, which leaves out
                    many older iGPUs. Many systems are still running outdated
                    CPUs and using BIOS instead of UEFI with no SecureBoot
                    support.

                    Canalys believes that a staggering 240 million PCs do not
                    comply with Windows 11's requirements and are set to be
                    rendered obsolete by Windows 10's October 14, 2025 support
                    deadline. While recycling remains a viable option for
                    these systems, the lack of compatibility with the latest
                    Windows iteration significantly devalues them, making
                    refurbishment less feasible. Consequently, despite growing
                    capabilities in the refurbishment sector, many of these
                    devices are still destined for landfills. This situation
                    highlights a critical challenge in managing and disposing of
                    electronic waste, Canalys believes.

                    Interesting as Reddit and Twitter are, they are much less

                    – the closest service in terms of usage is Tiktok with 63%
                    and Snapchat with 60%. While YouTube has a good,
                    well-documented API, there’s no good way to get a random,
                    representative sample of YouTube. Instead, most research on
                    YouTube either studies a collection of videos (all videos on
                    the channels of a selected set of users) or videos
                    discovered via recommendation (start with

                    recommended videos.) You can do excellent research with
                    either method, but you won’t get a sample of all YouTube
                    videos and you won’t be able to calculate the size of
                    YouTube.

                    I brought this problem to Jason Baumgartner, creator of
                    PushShift, and prince of the dark arts of data collection.
                    One of Jason’s skills is a deep knowledge of undocumented
                    APIs, ways of collecting data outside of official means.
                    Most platforms have one or more undocumented APIs, widely
                    used by programmers for that platform to build internal
                    tools. In the case of YouTube, that API is called
                    <a
                      href="https://gizmodo.com/how-project-innertube-helped-pull-youtube-out-of-the-gu-1704946491"
                      >“Inner Tube”</a
                    >
                    and its existence is an open secret in programmer
                    communities. Using InnerTube, Jason suggested we do
                    something that’s both really smart and really stupid: guess
                    at random URLs and see if there are videos there.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                As seen in his charts, the amount of videos there grows
                exponentially. Thus one could also conclude that the storage
                costs also grow in proportion.

                    in an email message from an authenticated attacker to a
                    recipient at email service B, and that propagates those
                    broken line endings verbatim when it forwards that message

                    "smuggled" SMTP MAIL/RCPT/DATA commands and message header
                    plus body text, email service B is tricked into receiving

                    holding that the North Carolina Board of Examiners for
                    Engineers and Surveyors violated the First Amendment when it
                    ordered retired engineer Wayne Nutt to stop expressing
                    opinions about engineering without a state license. Nutt,
                    represented by the Institute for Justice (IJ), filed the
                    lawsuit after the Board sent him a series of threatening
                    letters ordering him to stop publicly offering opinions
                    about engineering without a license, on pain of potential
                    criminal punishment. Today's ruling confirms that those
                    letters—and the law they were based on—violate the First
                    Amendment.

                    "State licensing boards nationwide increasingly act as if
                    they are boards of censors, deciding who may or may not
                    speak about the topics they regulate," explained IJ Attorney
                    Joe Gay. "Today's ruling is a powerful reminder that in this
                    country we rely on people to decide who they want to listen
                    to. We don't rely on government boards to decide who gets to
                    speak."

                    [...] "The First Amendment protects everyone's right to
                    speak their minds, whether they're talking about politics or
                    talking about math," explained IJ Deputy Director of
                    Litigation Robert McNamara. "Regulators often seem to forget
                    that basic fact, but we always stand ready to remind them."

                    Here at Popular Science we celebrate innovation. Whether
                    it's a new medical treatment, infrastructure project,
                    consumer product, or big idea, they almost always spring up
                    as the solution to a problem. Some honorees address age-old
                    annoyances while others speak to larger and even existential
                    issues that profoundly affect people around the globe. This
                    year, we've selected honorees that exemplify this desire to
                    improve people's lives, just as we have every year since

                    [...] Those of us who live in industrialized societies have
                    changed the habitats of our gut microbes to a fairly drastic
                    degree. We use antibiotics and antibacterials and eat a diet
                    of novel ingredients and heavily processed foods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result, microbiologists believe, we’ve been killing off
                    some of the microbes that humans once carried. Compare
                    modern-day fecal samples with ancient ones, and there are
                    clear differences. The microbiomes of today are less
                    diverse, with more of some bugs and fewer of others.
                    Scientists believe that some of the ones that are missing
                    have very important functions, like breaking down certain
                    carbohydrates and producing chemicals that might be
                    important for gut health.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some people call it a great extinction. And the decline in
                    these microbes has been
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nri.2017.77"
                      >linked to an uptick in a range of chronic diseases</a
                    >
                    like asthma, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Aleksandar Kostic, a microbiologist at Harvard Medical
                    School, wants to know what microbes our ancestors did have.
                    A couple of years ago, he and his colleagues looked for
                    microbial DNA in eight samples of ancient human feces
                    collected from the southwestern United States and Mexico.
                    These remains, known as paleofeces, were estimated to be
                    between 1,000 and 2,000 years old. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Kostic and his colleagues compared the fossilized poo
                    with modern-day microbiome samples from people from eight
                    different countries, they found significant differences. But
                    some samples were more similar than others. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Specifically, modern-day samples from people who live in
                    “nonindustrialized” communities had a lot more in common
                    with the ancient feces. “The paleofeces and the Yanomami
                    samples almost matched,” says Emma Allen-Vercoe, a
                    microbiologist at the University of Guelph in Canada, who
                    was not an author of the study. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “Taking advantage of an Indigenous population and
                    using their microbes to try to reinstate health in somebody
                    from a wealthy, industrialized nation, I think, is a
                    problematic thing to do,” says Sonnenburg. He doesn’t think
                    such experiments should never be done—just that the ethical
                    implications should be thoroughly explored, and that the
                    Hadza should be fully informed and consent to the research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Yanomami have had experiences similar to those of
                    the Hadza. “They’re angry that scientists have come, taken
                    their samples, and never come back,” says Good. The results
                    of the research aren’t shared with them. And neither are any
                    potential profits. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He is working to redress that with the
                    <a href="https://www.yanomamifoundation.org/"
                      >Yanomami Foundation</a
                    >, a nonprofit organization that aims to conduct ethical
                    research with the Yanomami by seeking consent and addressing
                    the wishes and needs of the community. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Even if these ethical problems are ever solved,
                    scientific ones will endure. For a start, while we believe
                    that microbial diversity is important, we haven’t firmly
                    established anything other than a correlation between health
                    and a more diverse microbiome. Is this diversity responsible
                    for a lack of chronic disease, or is it a consequence of a
                    particular diet that might not even benefit everyone in the
                    same way? 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We know that antibiotics can disrupt our gut health. But the
                    details of the link between microbial diversity and health
                    are still largely a mystery. Even if you assume diversity is
                    good, it’s not clear how much is needed—or what’s the best
                    way to foster it. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not too long ago, the line of thinking was that the more
                    diverse your diet, the better. Now Allen-Vercoe isn’t so
                    sure. People who live in big cities have such a wide range
                    of food options that they can eat a different meal every day
                    of the month. But they are thought to have some of the
                    “least healthy” microbiomes, she says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And for all we know, people in industrialized societies may
                    have lost microbes because they no longer serve any purpose
                    in our diet. Maybe they would be likely to cause an
                    infection. Maybe doing away with some of them is really no
                    great loss after all. Maybe the rise of chronic illness is
                    only correlated with the loss of microbial diversity, and
                    other factors are responsible.

                    Because microbes evolve and adapt to their environments, we
                    should expect the microbiomes of people who live in cities
                    to look different from those of people who live in forests.
                    “There is no archetypal microbiome that everyone should
                    [aspire to],” says Good. “Your microbiome is a reflection of
                    your intimate interaction with your surrounding ecosystem,
                    including the foliage, the air, the water, the food—and that
                    all plays a role in driving the diversity of the microbiome
                    within your gut and on your skin.”

                    Your snack habit may be even more calorie-dense than you
                    think, recent research suggests. A study estimated that
                    snacking contributes to around 20% of an average American’s
                    daily caloric intake, and these snacks often add little
                    nutritional value. The scientists found, though, that people
                    with type 2 diabetes seem to eat fewer snack-related
                    calories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study was led by scientists from The Ohio State
                    University. Research has consistently shown that Americans’
                    diets have gotten

                      >bigger over time</a
                    >. And it’s likely that these extra calories have
                    contributed to a rise in obesity and other metabolic
                    disorders like type 2 diabetes. But the study authors say
                    that little work has been done to specifically quantify the
                    snacking patterns of adults with type 2.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers found that people reported eating an
                    average two snacks a day, no matter their diabetes status.
                    Those without type 2 consumed roughly 500 calories from
                    their snacks, while those with diagnosed diabetes or
                    prediabetes ate slightly fewer. Overall, between 19.5% and
                    22.4% of a person’s daily calorie intake came from snacking,
                    or about the same amount we might get from a full meal. And
                    people’s snacks were typically not filled with the
                    healthiest ingredients. Nearly half of the calories consumed
                    in-between meals came from foods considered snacks and
                    sweets, for instance, while 15% of these calories were from
                    alcohol beverages in those without diabetes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The findings suggest that people with diabetes often
                    make a conscious effort to cut down on snacking, and that
                    further indicates that people are willing to listen to and
                    heed advice on what kinds of foods they should eat or avoid,
                    the study authors say. But they note that everyone could
                    benefit from these lessons.

                    “Diabetes education looks like it’s working, but we might

                    diabetes and even to people with normal blood glucose levels

                    [...] Taiwan's extraordinary success - the island ships more
                    than half of those trillion-plus chips, and nearly all of
                    the most advanced ones - has been driven by its mastery of
                    volume. In other words, Taiwanese manufacturing is
                    incredibly efficient.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Over time Taiwanese manufacturers have managed to cram
                    more and more circuits into mind-bogglingly smaller spaces.
                    Using the latest extreme-ultraviolet light lithography
                    machines, TSMC can etch 100 billion circuits on to a single
                    microprocessor, or over 100 million circuits per square
                    millimetre.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Why are Taiwanese companies so good at this? No-one seems to
                    know exactly why.

                  <p>
                    Dr Shih thinks it's simple: "We had brand new facilities,
                    with the most up-to-date equipment. We recruited the best
                    engineers. Even the machine operators were highly skilled.
                    And then we didn't just import technology, we absorbed the
                    lessons from our American teachers and applied continuous
                    improvement."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A young man who spent several years working at one of
                    Taiwan's largest electronics companies agrees: "I think
                    Taiwan's companies are bad at making big breakthroughs in
                    technology. But they are very good at taking someone else's
                    idea and making it better. This can be done by trial and
                    error, continuously tweaking small things."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But the young man, who did not want to reveal his
                    name, or that of the company, says Taiwanese companies have
                    another advantage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Compared to software engineers in the US, even at the best
                    companies here, engineers are paid quite badly," he said.
                    "But compared to other industries in Taiwan the pay is good.
                    So, if you work for a big electronic company after a few
                    years, you'll be able to get a mortgage, buy a car. You'll
                    be able to get married. So, people suck it up."

                    [...] "If people weren't willing to do the job the company
                    would be finished. It's because people are willing to put up
                    with hardship that these companies succeed."

                    restructure global chip production misunderstand its
                    success.

                    "If you look at the history of semiconductors, no one
                    country dominates this industry," he says. "Taiwan may
                    dominate the manufacturing sector. But there is a very long
                    supply chain and innovation from every part of it
                    contributes to the growth of the industry. "

                  <p>
                    [...] Dr Shih is doubtful Beijing can recreate this supply
                    chain - from materials to design to high-end production -
                    inside China.

                    "If they want to create a different model then I wish them
                    luck," he says with a shrug. "Because if you really want
                    innovation, you need everyone to work together from all
                    around the world. It's not one company or one country."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He is just as doubtful about cutting China out as the US has
                    been doing.

                  <p>
                    "I think that's probably a major mistake," he says. "When I
                    look back, I feel lucky to have witnessed the extraordinary
                    growth of Taiwan's economy and this long period of peace.
                    Now I see conflict in other parts of the world, and I worry
                    it may come to Asia.

                    Although China cannot flood the global market with chips
                    produced with cutting-edge fabrication technologies, strong
                    subsidies for the semiconductor sector in China make it
                    possible for the country to flood the market with chips made
                    on legacy process technologies, thus undercutting
                    much-needed sales that generate revenue that is vital for
                    R&amp;D at Western firms. This tactic could spur the U.S.

                    [...] China is known for providing hefty funds to its
                    chipmakers. For example, China-based SMIC invested $24
                    billion in capital expenditures from 2020 to 2023 with
                    support from banks, local governments, and state-controlled

                    from the government, which is how they can quickly expand
                    production capacity using tools that they can procure
                    without any limitations and start producing chips like
                    display driver ICs (DDICs) or power management ICs (PMICs)

                    tariffs or the use of other trade tools to counteract
                    China's aggressive expansion in the semiconductor industry.
                    Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has already indicated that
                    the U.S. is ready to use every tool it has to stop China
                    from flooding the market with low-cost legacy chips.
                    However, she clarified that the most stringent export
                    controls would remain reserved for more advanced process
                    technologies and not for these older generation nodes, so
                    Chinese companies will still be able to procure legacy

                    The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
                    has, after years of voicing its intent, officially submitted
                    an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking surrounding
                    anti-drunk-driving technology. This marks the first formal
                    salvo in its bid to ensure every new vehicle sold in America
                    comes with some form of built-in inebriation detection and
                    possibly an interlock that prevents the car from being
                    driven if the driver is determined to be impaired.

                    Alcohol-related vehicle crashes are among the leading cause
                    of injury and death on America's roadways, which already
                    have seen a precipitous backsliding in term of safety in
                    recent years. After decades of progress reducing roadway
                    deaths, America has seen car-related fatalities soar,
                    leaving policymakers stumped and scrambling for solutions.

                    rulemaking that would gather the information necessary to
                    develop performance requirements and require that new
                    passenger motor vehicles be equipped with advanced drunk and
                    impaired driving prevention technology through a new Federal
                    Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS)." The agency adds

                    "The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Bipartisan

                    rule establishing a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard
                    (FMVSS) that requires new passenger vehicles to have
                    'advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology'
                    by 2024. The BIL also provides that an FMVSS should be
                    issued only if it meets the requirements of the National

                Most likely solution are cameras that watch the driver for
                warning signs, these already exist on some cars. It will be
                interesting to see if other solutions are also put forward.

                    Of course, this opens many cans of worms. Will NHTSA
                    advocate a warning system onboard that alerts the driver
                    that they're impaired? An ignition interlock that prevents
                    the car from starting and driving at all? What if there are
                    false readings? A sober passenger taking whatever onboard
                    test exists in the driver's place? One also could imagine
                    the sort of arguments advocates of unfettered freedom might
                    come up with: Someone eluding an attacker, but who had
                    previously had a drink, being locked out of their means of
                    escape due to technological misunderstanding. Of course,
                    these concerns must be weighed against the more than 10,000
                    preventable deaths from drunk drivers annually.

                    The revelation raises grave medical privacy concerns,

                    working to criminalize reproductive health care. Even if
                    people in states with restrictive laws cross state lines for

                    Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.)—said their investigation pulled
                    information from briefings with eight big prescription drug
                    suppliers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All eight of the pharmacies said they do not require law
                    enforcement to have a warrant prior to sharing private and
                    sensitive medical records, which can include the
                    prescription drugs a person used or uses and their medical
                    conditions. Instead, all the pharmacies hand over such
                    information with nothing more than a subpoena, which can be
                    issued by government agencies and does not require review or
                    approval by a judge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For now, HIPAA regulations grant patients the right to
                    know who is accessing their health records. But, to do so,
                    patients have to specifically request that information—and
                    almost no one does that. "Last year, CVS Health, the largest
                    pharmacy in the nation by total prescription revenue, only
                    received a single-digit number of such consumer requests,"
                    the lawmakers noted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The average American is likely unaware that this is even a
                    problem," the lawmakers said.

                    For Terrapin to be viable, the connection it interferes with
                    also must be secured by either "ChaCha20-Poly1305" or "CBC
                    with Encrypt-then-MAC," both of which are cipher modes added
                    to the SSH protocol (in 2013 and 2012, respectively). A scan
                    performed by the researchers found that 77 percent of SSH
                    servers exposed to the Internet support at least one of the
                    vulnerable encryption modes, while 57 percent of them list a
                    vulnerable encryption mode as the preferred choice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At its core, Terrapin works by altering or corrupting
                    information transmitted in the SSH data stream during the
                    handshake—the earliest stage of a connection, when the two
                    parties negotiate the encryption parameters they will use to
                    establish a secure connection. The attack targets the BPP,
                    short for
                    <a
                      href="https://www.scribd.com/document/59627915/Ssh-Security"
                      >Binary Packet Protocol</a
                    >, which is designed to ensure that adversaries with an
                    active position can't add or drop messages exchanged during
                    the handshake. Terrapin relies on prefix truncation, a class
                    of attack that removes specific messages at the very
                    beginning of a data stream.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers note that they aren't the first people
                    to describe a prefix truncation attack on a network protocol
                    by manipulating sequence numbers. In 2015, researcher Cédric
                    Fournet
                    <a
                      href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/extoO9ETJLnEm3MRDTO23x70DFM"
                      >envisioned a similar attack</a
                    >
                    on a draft of the upcoming version 1.3 of TLS. Fournet's
                    technique increased sequence numbers by fragmenting messages
                    rather than injecting them as Terrapin does. (Terrapin
                    injects an IGNORE message to asymmetrically increase the
                    sequence number on one side of the communication.) Fournet's
                    attack was deemed theoretical because the manipulation in
                    this case was likely to cause TLS handshakes to fail. The
                    possibility of a successful exploit nonetheless prompted
                    engineers to follow Fournet's advice to revert back to 1.2's
                    practice of resetting record-layer sequence numbers to 0
                    whenever new keys were installed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In response to recommendations provided by the researchers
                    ahead of the publication of Monday's paper, the developers
                    of SSH software, including the nearly ubiquitous OpenSSH,
                    have updated their implementations to support an optional
                    strict key exchange. It provides for sequence number resets
                    and also prevents an attacker's capability to inject packets
                    during the initial unencrypted handshake. For the fix to
                    take effect, both client and server must support this
                    backward-compatible change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] People who want to know if the SSH client or server
                    they use is vulnerable to Terrapin can use a
                    <a href="https://terrapin-attack.com/#scanner"
                      >custom scanner</a
                    >
                    developed by the researchers. It connects to a server or
                    monitors the incoming client connection to determine whether
                    one of the vulnerable encryption modes is available and if
                    the countermeasure requiring a strict key exchange is
                    supported. The scanner doesn't perform a full-fledged
                    handshake or carry out the attack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While the risk Terrapin poses varies, it invalidates
                    proofs published in 2016 that concluded such attacks weren't
                    possible. The real lesson is that practical evaluations,
                    like the one provided in Monday's research, are crucial for
                    revealing previously overlooked flaws in such proofs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In any case, proofs need to be updated over time to reflect
                    changes and extensions to the protocol," the researchers
                    wrote. "Although we suggest backward-compatible
                    countermeasures to stop our attacks, we note that the
                    security of the SSH protocol would benefit from a redesign
                    from scratch, guided by all findings and insights from both
                    practical and theoretical security analysis, in a similar
                    manner as was done for TLS 1.3."

                    Extreme, inappropriate, and harmful content continues to be
                    easily and widely accessible by children and adolescents.
                    This can be spread through direct pushes, unwanted content
                    exchanges, and algorithmic designs. In certain tragic cases,
                    childhood deaths have been linked to suicide- and
                    self-harm-related content and risk-taking challenges on
                    social media platforms. This content may be especially risky
                    for children and adolescents who are already experiencing
                    mental health difficulties. Despite social media providing a
                    sense of community for some, a systematic review of more
                    than two dozen studies found that some social media
                    platforms show live depictions of self-harm acts like
                    partial asphyxiation, leading to seizures, and cutting,
                    leading to significant bleeding. Further, these studies
                    found that discussing or showing this content can normalize
                    such behaviors, including through the formation of suicide
                    pacts and posting of self-harm models for others to follow.

                    Social media may also perpetuate body dissatisfaction,
                    disordered eating behaviors, social comparison, and low
                    self-esteem, especially among adolescent girls. A synthesis
                    of 20 studies demonstrated a significant relationship
                    between social media use and body image concerns and eating
                    disorders, with social comparison as a potential
                    contributing factor. Social comparison driven by social
                    media is associated with body dissatisfaction, disordered
                    eating, and depressive symptoms. When asked about the impact
                    of social media on their body image, nearly half (46%) of
                    adolescents aged 13–17 said social media makes them feel
                    worse, 40% said it makes them feel neither better nor worse,
                    and only 14% said it makes them feel better.

                    When it is very windy, the grid cannot handle the extra
                    power generated. Wind farms are paid to switch off and
                    gas-powered stations are paid to fire up. The cost is passed
                    on to consumers.

                    The government said major reforms will halve the time it
                    takes to build energy networks to cope with extra wind

                    Most of the UK's offshore wind farms are in England -

                    is the largest in the world. Meanwhile, around half of
                    onshore wind farms are in Scotland but most electricity is
                    used in south-east England.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Carbon Tracker said the main problem in getting electricity
                    to where it is needed is a bottleneck in transmission
                    between Scotland and England.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The practice of switching off wind farms and ramping up
                    power stations is known as "wind curtailment" and the costs
                    are passed on to consumers, it said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The problem is, there are not enough cables. The
                    logical solution would be to build more grid
                    infrastructure," said Lorenzo Sani, analyst at Carbon
                    Tracker.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's not even that expensive," he added, compared with
                    mounting wind curtailment costs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, historically it has taken between 10 and 15
                    years for new transmission cables to be approved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In November, the government set out a plan to reduce
                    the time it takes to build new infrastructure from 14 to
                    seven years, "speeding up grid connections, supporting
                    thousands of jobs and reducing electricity bills for
                    households across Great Britain", a spokesperson said.

                  <p>
                    Energy regulator Ofgem said there was a "long queue" of
                    energy projects "which could generate almost 400GW of
                    electricity - well in excess of what is needed to power the
                    entire British energy system".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The watchdog said new rules "will allow stalled or
                    speculative 'zombie' projects to be forced out of the queue,
                    meaning viable projects can be connected quicker".

                  <p>
                    Mr Sani from Carbon Tracker said it was unclear how much
                    difference these projects would make before 2030.

                    tried to refute the competitor's statements with new

                    its own version of the story, refuting Nvidia's statements
                    about H100 superiority. Nvidia used TensorRT-LLM on H100,
                    instead of vLLM used in AMD benchmarks, while comparing
                    performance of FP16 datatype on AMD Instinct MI300X to FP8
                    datatype on H100. Furthermore, Team Green inverted AMD's
                    published performance data from relative latency numbers to
                    absolute throughput.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AMD suggests that Nvidia tried to rig the game, while it is
                    still busy identifying new paths to unlock performance and
                    raw power on Instinct MI300 accelerators. The company
                    provided the latest performance levels achieved by the Llama
                    70B chatbot model on MI300X, showing an even higher edge
                    over Nvidia's H100.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By using the vLLM language model for both accelerators,
                    MI300X was able to achieve 2.1x the performance of H100
                    thanks to the latest optimizations in AMD's software stack
                    (ROCm). The company highlighted a 1.4x performance advantage
                    over H100 (with equivalent datatype and library setup)
                    earlier in December. vLLM was chosen because of its broad
                    adoption within the community and the ability to run on both
                    GPU architectures.

                    [...] Another encouraging development on the otherwise
                    daunting topic of climate change is the growing recognition
                    that cutting methane pollution is one of the most powerful
                    levers we can pull to limit global warming over the coming
                    years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Carbon dioxide has long overshadowed methane, since we emit
                    so much more of it. But methane traps about 80 times as much
                    heat over a 20-year period and accounts for at least a
                    quarter of overall warming above our preindustrial past.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the other hand, it also breaks down far faster in the
                    atmosphere. Together, those qualities mean that rapid cuts
                    in methane emissions today could deliver an outsize impact

                    least we can ask of an industry. But it's a step forward
                    that promises to eliminate the warming equivalent of about

                    [...] As with every issue when it comes to climate change,
                    none of this is enough, too much of it is voluntary, and
                    complications abound. But these announcements, along with

                  <p>
                    While the world scrambles to slow our emissions, it's
                    becoming ever more clear that the damage from climate change
                    is happening in the present tense, with wildfires, floods,
                    and heat waves making headlines.

                  <p>
                    So it was welcome news that this year's UN climate
                    conference started with a historic milestone for vulnerable
                    countries struggling to deal with these problems. On day one
                    of the talks, the long-anticipated loss and damage fund was
                    officially launched.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The purpose of this fund is to help poor and
                    developing countries address the increasing harm from
                    climate disasters. Many of these countries—which have
                    contributed the least amount of emissions—are the most
                    vulnerable to climate impacts and often lack adequate
                    resources to manage them. The funds can help them rebuild in
                    the aftermath of events like drought or floods, and improve
                    a nation's ability to withstand future catastrophes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] By the end of COP28 on December 12, countries had
                    collectively committed nearly $800 million. The United Arab
                    Emirates and Germany each pledged $100 million, the United
                    Kingdom offered $75 million, and the United States
                    contributed $17.5 million.

                    have made a sports analogy that puts this all in
                    perspective. On December 9, a baseball player, Shohei
                    Ohtani, signed a $700 million contract with the LA Dodgers.
                    The fact that a worldwide effort to address climate change
                    is even remotely comparable to the amount spent by a sports
                    team on a single athlete should be a global embarrassment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] That being said, the fund is still a step toward
                    equitable climate resilience. Now the focus is on continuing
                    to scale up the commitments and making the funds more
                    accessible to those who need them.

                    [...] Alex Haffner, competition partner at UK law firm
                    Fladgate, told <em>The Register</em> in an email that the
                    announcement reflects broad regulatory consensus that the
                    tie-up would have harmed competition.

                    "People seeing today’s announcement by Adobe may view it as
                    an anti Big Tech stance from the CMA, following on from the

                    was both the CMA and the European Commission who were
                    expecting significant concessions in the form of a
                    structural divestment in order to clear the deal and that
                    was not a price Adobe could pay.

                    "Moreover, unlike in the Microsoft case, Figma appears to be
                    quite willing to retain its independence (and take any break
                    up fee it negotiated from Adobe). Certainly the regulatory
                    landscape for Big Tech has become somewhat more complicated
                    in recent times, but, on this occasion at least, the
                    regulators appear to be talking with a unified voice in
                    their opposition to the proposed deal."

                    As some cars gain more autonomy, it's probably helpful if
                    they have a way to signal their intentions to other road

                    the headlight and taillight clusters as well as the side

                    [...] News that Google will soon move its users' location
                    data to their devices was met with cautious praise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has challenged the
                    constitutionality of geofence warrants in court, said
                    <a
                      href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/12/end-geofence-warrants"
                      >in a blog post</a
                    >
                    that "for now, at least, we'll take this as a win." But the
                    EFF noted that there are other ways that Google can still
                    turn over sensitive personal data on its users. Law
                    enforcement uses similar legal demands, dubbed "reverse
                    keyword" warrants, to identify Google accounts that searched
                    for a particular keyword in time, such as prior to a crime
                    being committed. Google has not said if it plans to close
                    the loophole that allows police and law enforcement to serve
                    so-called "reverse keyword" warrants for users' search
                    queries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's not to say that geofence warrants will fizzle out
                    overnight. Google still retains huge banks of historical
                    location data that police can tap into any time, up until
                    whenever Google decides it no longer wants to keep it. And
                    all the while tech companies store vast troves of users'
                    location data, they too can be subject to similar legal
                    demands.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But there is hope that Google shutting the door on geofence
                    warrants — at least going forward — could significantly
                    curtail this surveillance loophole.

                    is often seen as a direct competitor to Arm. Most people
                    view the two ISAs as being engaged in a winner-take-all,
                    zero-sum contest, where only one can prevail. However, we
                    believe that, at least for the foreseeable future, the
                    industry will witness a greater degree of mixing and
                    matching. Both ISAs are likely to coexist side by side
                    within increasingly heterogeneous chips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Admittedly, the entire history of technology is against us
                    on this one. Over the past 40 years, we have seen a
                    recurring pattern: software ecosystems tend to consolidate
                    around a single platform. No one wants to write the same
                    software twice, and not just write but design, test, and
                    debug. So, developers have generally followed their own
                    paths to maximize profits, which, over time, leads to the
                    dominance of a single platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, this old truism is not entirely accurate... ISAs
                    are not exactly software.

                    (though not entirely, but close enough for our discussion).
                    By mixing and matching the two systems, chip designers can
                    find more optimal paths for their needs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is not just theory; we have seen it in practice.
                    Apple's A- and M-Series processors, as well as Google's
                    TPUs, appear to incorporate both Arm and RISC-V cores. This
                    trend is evident in many other chips as well.

                    [...] Will this remain the case forever? Ask anyone on
                    either side, and they are quick to say no. Highlander rules
                    apply, there can be only one. However, in practice, we are
                    not so certain.

                    This has opened up the door to a rethinking of past rules.
                    Therefore, we expect that for a long time to come, we will
                    see both RISC-V and Arm sitting next to each other in many
                    chips.

                    Arctic people today travel along sea ice on dog sleds and
                    snow mobiles. Early Americans may also have used the 'sea
                    ice highway' to get around and hunt marine mammals, slowly
                    making their way into North America in the process,
                    Praetorius said. The climate data suggest conditions along
                    the coastal route may have been conducive to migration
                    between 24,500 and 22,000 years ago and 16,400-14,800 years
                    ago, possibly aided by the presence of winter sea ice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While proving that people were using sea ice to travel will
                    be tricky, given most of the archaeological sites are
                    underwater, the theory provides a new framework for
                    understanding how humans may have arrived in North America
                    without a land bridge or easy ocean travel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And the sea ice highway isn't mutually exclusive with other
                    human migrations further down the line, says Praetorius. The
                    team's models show the Alaskan current had calmed down by
                    14,000 years ago, making it easier for people to travel by
                    boat along the coast.

                I came across an interesting blog post that suggests the Web is
                splitting into two with an offshoot made up of a commercial
                dystopia that is increasingly viewed as the "normal web,"
                leaving an insurmountable chasm developing between the two.
                Regular readers of SN will appreciate the points made, but do
                you agree with them, particularly where you'll eventually need
                to pick one side or the other?

                    There's an increasing chasm dividing the modern web. On one
                    side, the commercial, monopolies-riddled, media-adored web.
                    A web which has only one objective: making us click. It
                    measures clicks, optimises clicks, generates clicks. It
                    gathers as much information as it could about us and spams
                    every second of our life with ads, beep, notifications,
                    vibrations, blinking LEDs, background music and fluorescent
                    titles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A web which boils down to Idiocracy in a Blade Runner
                    landscape, a complete cyberpunk dystopia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then there's the tech-savvy web. People who install
                    adblockers or alternative browsers. People who try
                    alternative networks such as Mastodon or, God forbid,
                    Gemini. People who poke fun at the modern web by building
                    true HTML and JavaScript-less pages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Between those two extremes, the gap is widening. You have to
                    choose your camp. When browsing on the "normal web", it is
                    increasingly required to disable at least part of your
                    antifeatures-blockers to access content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Something strange is happening: it's not only a part
                    of the web which is disappearing for me. As I'm blocking
                    completely google analytics, every Facebook domain and any
                    analytics I can, I'm also disappearing for them. I don't see
                    them and they don't see me!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Think about it! That whole "MBA, designers and marketers
                    web" is now optimised thanks to analytics describing people
                    who don't block analytics (and bots pretending to be those
                    people). Each day, I feel more disconnected from that part
                    of the web.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It feels like everyone is now choosing its side. You
                    can't stay in the middle anymore. You are either dedicating
                    all your CPU cycles to run JavaScript tracking you or
                    walking away from the big monopolies. You are either being
                    paid to build huge advertising billboards on top of yet
                    another framework or you are handcrafting HTML.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Maybe the web is not dying. Maybe the web is only splitting
                    itself in two.

                    Ramsey numbers can be thought of as representing the
                    boundaries of disorder. And it's notoriously hard to figure

                    invite to a party so that at least three people will either
                    already be acquainted with each other or at least three
                    people will be total strangers to each other.

                  <p>
                    Here, the Ramsey number, r, is the minimum number of people
                    needed at the party so that either s people know each other
                    or t people don't know each other. This can be written as
                    r(s,t), and we know the answer to r(3,3) = 6.

                    will find three people who all know each other or three

                    [...] After almost a year and several math obstacles, they
                    found r(4,t) is close to a cubic function of t. For a party
                    with four people who all know each other or t people who
                    don't, you need t<sup>3</sup> people.

                    An EV from Chinese manufacturer Nio will soon go on sale
                    with a "semi-solid state" 150kWh battery (140kWh usable)
                    that's the largest in any passenger car,
                    <a
                      href="https://carnewschina.com/2023/12/17/nio-et7-with-150-kwh-semi-solid-state-battery-achieves-a-1044-km-range/"
                      ><em>Car News China</em></a
                    >
                    reported. To show [how] much range that will deliver, Nio
                    CEO William Li drove a prototype version of the
                    <a href="https://www.nio.com/et7">ET7</a> 1,044km (650
                    miles) in 14 hours, a distance surpassing many gas-powered
                    vehicles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The test was run in relatively cool temperatures (between 28
                    – 54 F) and livestreamed. Driving was done mainly in
                    semi-autonomous (or Navigate-on-Pilot+, as Nio calls it),
                    and speed-limited to 90 km/h (56 MPH). The average speed was
                    83.9 km/h (a respectable 52.4 MPH), with a travel time of
                    12.4 hours excluding stops.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The completion of this endurance challenge proves the
                    product power of the 150kWh ultra-long endurance battery
                    pack," said Li in a
                    <a href="https://weibo.com/1679013335/NxB38DRUX"
                      >Weibo post</a
                    >
                    (Google translation). "More importantly, all models on sale
                    can be flexibly upgraded to 150kWh batteries through the Nio
                    battery swap system."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In fact, the ET7's 150kWh battery will only be available on
                    a lease separate from the car, much as we've seen with some
                    cars sold in Europe. Previously, the company said that the
                    battery alone would cost as much as an entire car (the
                    company's entry-level ET5 EV), or around $42,000.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Nio is a luxury EV manufacturer in China that offers
                    vehicles without a battery, letting you sign up to a
                    battery-as-a-service (BAAS) monthly subscription. That
                    service also allows you to swap out your battery at any time

                    to have accessed "88 consoles from another account" when
                    logging into the Unifi portal. The user had full access to
                    these devices until refreshing their browser. After that,
                    the client returned to normal, with only owned devices

                    [...] The company claims the problem happened due to an
                    upgrade to Ubiquiti's UniFi Cloud infrastructure, which it
                    has since resolved. So, customers should no longer worry
                    about their other users accessing their cameras and UniFi
                    accounts. While the company claimed the bungle affected
                    1,216 accounts in one group and 1,177 in another, supposedly
                    fewer than a dozen instances of improper access occurred. It
                    added that it would notify those customers about the breach.

                in February 2024. This is a significant turning point because
                Usenet predates the Internet. Much of the Internet and, later,
                the WWW, was designed and built around Usenet discussions. That
                includes Linus Torvalds' now famous announcement about his then
                hobby, which he asserted at the time would not be big and
                professional like GNU:

                    If you don't actively engage with Usenet content, you don't
                    need to do anything. Current Usenet users will need to do
                    two things before February 22, 2024 if they want to continue
                    engaging with Usenet content:

                      <strong>Find a new Usenet client. </strong>Several free
                      and paid alternatives are available, both web-based and
                      application-based. To find a client, do a web search for
                      "how do I find a usenet text client"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Find a new public Usenet server. </strong> The new
                      client you choose will likely have a default server or a
                      set of curated options for you. If not, to find a server,
                      do a web search for "public NNTP servers."

                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    Because Usenet is a distributed system,
                    <strong>you do not need to migrate data</strong>. All of the
                    Usenet content you can access today on Google Groups should
                    already be synced to the new server you choose. After you
                    select a new client and server, you can reselect the groups
                    you're interested in.

                For the time being, you will be able to continue to view and
                search for the many decades of historical Usenet content posted
                before February 22, 2024 which Google acquired itself combined
                with the vast, historically important archives from Deja News.

              <p>
                Usenet remains a distributed, decentralized, peer-to-peer
                messaging network. The news readers contact an NNTP server in a
                client-server relation but the NNTP servers themselves
                communicated as peers. One thorn in the side for the powers
                which be is that it is essentially uncensorable. In the old days
                it was sufficient to get a floppy or two across the border to
                complete the circuit via sneakernet. One downside, sometimes
                humorous, was that propagation delays resulting from the
                distributed, decentralized nature of the peer-to-peer network
                meant that sometimes one saw a response hours or days before the
                original message showed up.

                  <p>
                    The SBOM and its contents must be validated and verified.
                    Validation assures that the SBOM data is appropriately
                    formatted and can be integrated into various tools and
                    automation. Verification ensures the content within the SBOM
                    is accurately described and all components and related
                    information on a product for licensing and exporting are
                    represented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many organizations are increasingly incorporating tools into
                    the build and source repository facility to automate this
                    process and provide artifacts which can attest to the
                    verification of the SBOM being delivered. Both the content
                    of the package, the executables, libraries and configuration
                    files, and the actual format of the SBOM, should be
                    validated. Any open-source software components should be
                    verified for license or export restrictions. In some
                    organizations, validation is performed first by the
                    developer during build/packing of the product and then by
                    the developer/supplier before customer delivery to verify
                    the integrity of the SBOM being delivered. For more
                    information on the formats and tools available for
                    validation, refer to section 5.1.5 of this document "<i
                      >SBOM Validation</i
                    >."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A good reference on guidance for the SBOM process can be
                    found in NTIA's publication "<i
                      >Software Suppliers Playbook: SBOM Production and
                      Provision</i
                    >" guidance. It is important that developers understand the
                    end-user requirements for SBOM generation and how this
                    information might be used by both suppliers and customers.
                    Additional process information relating to SBOMs and
                    acquisitions can be found in the "<i

                    It's hard to know exactly how dire the financial situation
                    is at Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter). However, insider
                    sources recently revealed
                    <a
                      href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-12/musk-s-x-2023-ad-sales-projected-to-slump-to-about-2-5-billion"
                      >to Bloomberg</a
                    >
                    that the social media platform expects to end 2023 with
                    "roughly" $2.5 billion in advertising revenue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's "a significant slump from prior years," sources said.
                    It's also about half a billion short of the $3 billion that
                    X executives expected to make in ad sales in 2023, one
                    source said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last year, Twitter raked in more than $1 billion in ad
                    revenue per quarter, sources said. But in each of the first
                    three quarters of 2023, X only managed to generate "a little
                    more than $600 million" in ad revenue.

                    apologized, but he never removed his controversial

                    Among the major brands pausing advertising on X is Disney,
                    which seems to have particularly offended Musk. He's spent
                    the past week targeting Disney CEO Bob Iger in a series of X
                    posts, calling out Disney for boycotting X. Musk appears
                    particularly frustrated that Disney is advertising on Meta
                    platforms after New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez
                    filed a lawsuit
