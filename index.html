                    From the information contained in Bruno's comment, it
                    appears as though the work to correct the ground systems to
                    fuel Vulcan—the first stage propellant is methane, which
                    United Launch Alliance has not worked with before—will take
                    long enough that it will preclude another fueling test ahead
                    of the rocket's late December launch window. Thus, the next
                    launch attempt will likely occur no earlier than January 8.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It has been a slow year for United Launch Alliance, which
                    dominated the US launch industry a decade ago. The company
                    is going to launch just three rockets this calendar year:
                    the classified NROL-68 mission on a Delta IV Heavy rocket in
                    June, the "Silentbarker" mission for the National
                    Reconnaissance Office on an Atlas V in September, and two
                    Project Kuiper satellites for Amazon on an Atlas V in
                    October.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That is the company's lowest total number of launches since
                    its founding in 2006, when the rocket businesses of Lockheed
                    Martin and Boeing were merged.

                  <p>
                    "The appeal with the Higher Regional Court in Dresden
                    follows a decision by the Regional Court in Leipzig, in
                    which Sony prevailed, and Quad9 was convicted as a
                    wrongdoer. "
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From a practical perspective, Quad9 has removed the blocks
                    on all domains previously noted by Sony and documented in
                    the lower courts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ...the servers in question in this case were not located in
                    Germany, and the links they pointed to were on servers also
                    not in Germany.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sony Entertainment further asserted that we block the
                    domains globally, not just in Germany
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Quad9 has no office or standing in Germany (we are a Swiss
                    entity), but due to the Lugano Convention treaty it was
                    possible for Sony to serve an injunction in Switzerland and
                    drag Quad9 into legal proceedings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The court has also ruled that the case cannot be taken
                    to a higher court and their decision is the final word in
                    this particular case. Sony may appeal the appeal closure via
                    a complaint against the denial of leave of appeal and then
                    would have to appeal the case itself with the German Federal
                    Court. So while there is still a possibility that this case
                    could continue, Sony would have to win twice to turn the
                    decision around again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Quad9 have received a notice from a consortium of
                    Italian rightsholders (Sony Music Italy, Universal Music
                    Italy, Warner Music Italy, and Federation of Italian Music
                    Industry) who have demanded that Quad9 block domains in
                    Italy, and there is potentially another court process ahead
                    of us."

                <div>
                  <p>
                    [...] So what is L4S, and how would it make my internet
                    faster?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    L4S stands for Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput,
                    and its goal is to make sure your packets spend as little
                    time needlessly waiting in line as possible by reducing the
                    need for queuing. To do this, it works on making the latency
                    feedback loop shorter; when congestion starts happening, L4S
                    means your devices find out about it almost immediately and
                    can start doing something to fix the problem. Usually, that
                    means backing off slightly on how much data they're sending.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As we covered before, our devices are constantly speeding
                    up, then slowing down, and repeating that cycle because the
                    amount of data that links in the network have to deal with
                    is constantly changing. But packets dropping isn't a great
                    signal, especially when buffers are part of the equation —
                    your device won't realize it's sending too much data until
                    it's sending <em>way</em> too much data, meaning it has to
                    clamp down hard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    L4S, however, gets rid of that lag between the problem
                    beginning and each device in the chain finding out about it.
                    That makes it easier to maintain a good amount of data
                    throughput without adding latency that increases the amount
                    of time it takes for data to be transferred.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    L4S lets the packets tell your device how well their journey
                    went
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For everyone else, I'll try to boil it down as much as I can
                    without glossing over too much. The L4S standard adds an
                    indicator to packets, which says whether they experienced
                    congestion on their journey from one device to another. If
                    they sail right on through, there's no problem, and nothing
                    happens. But if they have to wait in a queue for more than a
                    specified amount of time, they get marked as having
                    experienced congestion. That way, the devices can start
                    making adjustments immediately to keep the congestion from
                    getting worse and to potentially eliminate it altogether.
                    That keeps the data flowing as fast as it possibly can and
                    gets rid of the disruptions and mitigations that can add
                    latency with other systems.

                    Research also has shown that the retina selectively
                    accumulates lutein and zeaxanthin from the diet, forming
                    visible yellow macular pigment that enhances vision and
                    protects photoreceptors. By noninvasively measuring
                    patients' macular pigment optical density, researchers can
                    estimate the concentration of lutein and zeaxanthin in the
                    brain.

                    "Recent advances in new therapies for Alzheimer's disease
                    show exciting promise as an effective way to slow disease
                    progression," Dorey said. "I'd be thrilled if our data
                    motivated people to keep their brains in optimum condition
                    with a colorful diet with abundant carotenoids and regular
                    exercise. Available studies suggest this may also reduce
                    risk for dementia."

                    Investing.com, a Tel Aviv-based site owned by Joffre
                    Capital, is a financial news and information hub that
                    provides a mix of markets data and investing tips and
                    trends. But increasingly, the site has been relying on AI to
                    create its stories, which often appear to be thinly-veiled
                    copies of human-written stories written elsewhere.

                  <p>
                    [...] Pere Monguió, the head of content at FXStreet, told
                    Semafor in an email that he and his team noticed several
                    months ago that Investing was publishing stories similar to
                    their site's articles. FXStreet's 60-person team monitors
                    and quickly analyzes developments in global currencies. By
                    pumping out AI articles, Investing was eroding FXStreet's
                    edge, Monguió said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Using AI to rewrite exclusive content from competitors is a
                    threat to journalism and original content creation," he
                    said.

                    senior vice president and chief legal officer at The Motley
                    Fool, said in an email. "We have seen, and acted against,
                    people plagiarizing our content from time to time, and if
                    you're right about what's going on, AI has achieved a level
                    of human intelligence that copies good content and makes it
                    mediocre."

                    Verizon Wireless gave a female victim's address and phone
                    logs to an alleged stalker who pretended to be a police
                    officer, according to an affidavit filed by an FBI special
                    agent. The man, Robert Michael Glauner, was later arrested
                    near the victim's home and found to be carrying a knife at
                    the time, according to the affidavit submitted in court
                    yesterday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Glauner allegedly traveled from New Mexico to Raleigh, North
                    Carolina, after finding out where she lived and, before
                    arriving, sent a threatening message that said, "if I can't
                    have you no one can." He also allegedly threatened to send
                    nude photos of the victim to her family members.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Glauner and the victim met in August or September 2023
                    on xhamster.com, a porn website with dating features, and
                    "had an online romantic relationship," the affidavit said.
                    The victim ended the relationship, but Glauner "continued to
                    contact or try to contact" her, the document said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Glauner tricked Verizon into providing sensitive information
                    by sending an email and fake search warrant to
                    vsat.cct@one.verizon.com, the email address for the Verizon
                    Security Assistance Team (VSAT), which handles legal
                    requests. Verizon didn't realize the request was fraudulent
                    even though it came from a Proton Mail address rather than
                    from a police department or other governmental agency,
                    according to the affidavit filed yesterday by FBI Special
                    Agent Michael Neylon.

                  <p>
                    An email to Verizon from "steven1966c@proton.me" on
                    September 26, 2023, said, "Here is the pdf file for search
                    warrant. We are in need if the [<em>sic</em>] this cell
                    phone data as soon as possible to locate and apprehend this
                    suspect. We also need the full name of this Verizon
                    subscriber and the new phone number that has been assigned
                    to her. Thank you."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The email's attached document contained a fake affidavit
                    written by "Detective Steven Cooper" of the Cary, North
                    Carolina Police Department. The Cary Police Department
                    confirmed that no officer named Steven Cooper is employed by
                    their agency, Neylon wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But after reviewing the email and document sent by
                    "Cooper," Verizon provided an address and phone logs. "On
                    October 5, 2023, Verizon Wireless provided Victim 1's phone
                    records, including address and phone logs, to Glauner,"
                    according to Neylon's affidavit.

                    When a material exists as an ultrathin layer—a mere one or a
                    few atoms thick—it has totally different properties from
                    thicker samples of the same material. That's because
                    confining electrons to a 2D plane gives rise to exotic
                    states. Because of their flat dimensions and their broad
                    compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies, such
                    2D materials are promising for harnessing new phenomenon in
                    electronic devices.

                    These states include quantum spin Hall insulators, which
                    conduct electricity along their edges but are electrically
                    insulating in their interiors. Such systems when coupled
                    with superconductivity have been proposed as a route toward
                    engineering topological superconducting states that have
                    potential application in future topological quantum
                    computers.

                    Now, Michael Randle at the RIKEN Advanced Device Laboratory,
                    along with co-workers from RIKEN and Fujitsu, have created a
                    2D Josephson junction with active components entirely from a
                    material known to be a quantum spin Hall insulator. The work
                    is published in the journal Advanced Materials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Josephson junction is generally made by sandwiching a
                    material between two elemental superconductors. In contrast,
                    Randle and team fabricated their device from a single
                    crystal of monolayer 2D tungsten telluride, which had
                    previously been shown to exhibit both a superconducting
                    state and a quantum spin Hall insulator one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We fabricated the junction entirely from monolayer tungsten
                    telluride," says Randle. "We did this by exploiting its
                    ability to be tuned into and out of the superconducting
                    state using electrostatic gating."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The next step involves the implementation of
                    ultraflat pre-patterned gate structures by using, for
                    example, chemical–mechanical polishing," explains Randle.
                    "If this is achieved, we hope to form Josephson junctions
                    with precisely tailored geometries and to use our
                    cutting-edge microwave resonator experiment techniques to
                    observe and investigate the exciting topological nature of
                    the devices."

                    A series of attacks against Microsoft Active Directory
                    domains could allow miscreants to spoof DNS records,
                    compromise Active Directory and steal all the secrets it
                    stores, according to Akamai security researchers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We're told the attacks - which are usable against servers
                    running the default configuration of Microsoft Dynamic Host
                    Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers - don't require any
                    credentials.

                  <p>
                    Akamai says it reported the issues to Redmond, which isn't
                    planning to fix the issue. Microsoft did not respond to
                    <em>The Register</em>'s inquiries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] DHCP is a commonly used network management protocol,
                    and Microsoft's DHCP server is widely used in corporate
                    networks. Organizations can create DNS record using a DHCP
                    feature called DHCP DNS Dynamic Updates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Whenever a client is given an IP address by the DHCP
                    server, the latter can contact the DNS server and update the
                    client's DNS record," Akamai's Ori David explained.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the DHCP server registers or modifies a DNS record on
                    behalf of its clients, it uses DNS Dynamic Updates — and
                    therein lies the problem. DHCP DNS Dynamic Updates does not
                    require any authentication by the DHCP client, and Microsoft
                    DHCP servers enable DHCP DNS Dynamic Updates by default.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "So an attacker can essentially use the DHCP server to
                    authenticate to the DNS server on behalf of themself," David
                    said. "This grants the attacker access to the ADIDNS zone
                    without any credentials."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In addition to creating non-existent DNS records,
                    unauthenticated attackers can also use the DHCP server to
                    overwrite existing data, including DNS records inside the
                    ADI zone in instances where the DHCP server is installed on
                    a domain controller, which David says is the case in 57
                    percent of the networks Akamai monitors.

                    The Hubble Space Telescope is expected to resume science
                    operations on Friday, after a gyroscope glitch forced NASA
                    to suspend astronomical observations for weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "After analyzing the data, the team has determined science
                    operations can resume under three-gyro control," the US
                    space agency

                    in its latest update. "Based on the performance observed
                    during the tests, the team has decided to operate the gyros
                    in a higher-precision mode during science observations.
                    Hubble's instruments and the observatory itself remain
                    stable and in good health."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Launched in 1990, the telescope has been

                    multiple times over its decades-long lifetime. In 2009
                    Hubble was equipped with six new gyros. Only three remain
                    operational.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gyros measure how fast the telescope turns, and help it stay
                    fixed onto a cosmic target as it orbits in space. One of
                    them began behaving oddly, however, leading to faulty
                    readings – so Hubble automatically entered safe mode on
                    November 19.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "To date, three of those gyros remain operational,
                    including the gyro currently experiencing fluctuations.
                    Hubble uses three gyros to maximize efficiency, but could
                    continue to make science observations with only one gyro if
                    required," NASA explained.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The instrument should be able to keep studying stars and
                    galaxies and analyze their light in visible and ultraviolet
                    wavelengths until the end of this decade, and maybe into the
                    early 2030s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the telescope is slowly drifting from its intended orbit
                    – currently at about an altitude of 525 kilometers above
                    Earth's atmosphere. It's expected to drop to 500 kilometers
                    by 2025, and at this rate will be drawn down and reenter
                    Earth's atmosphere and be destroyed by the mid 2030s –
                    unless a rescue mission is carried out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA hasn't quite decided on what it will do before then,
                    but has suggested it might attach a

                    – either to help the Hubble execute a controlled reentry so
                    it's destroyed over the Pacific Ocean, or boost the
                    telescope higher into orbit so it can continue operating.

                    [...] The discovery also offers a rare clue into how
                    tyrannosaurs grew from one-meter-long at birth to some of
                    the biggest predators to have ever walked the Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This fossil is the first solid evidence that tyrannosaurids
                    drastically changed their diet as they grew from teenagers
                    to adults," Zelenitsky said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Young tyrannosaurs had slender heads and legs, sharp
                    knife-like teeth for dissecting carcasses, and could
                    probably run quite fast to catch their turkey-like prey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These youths probably looked more similar to the
                    velociraptors depicted in the movie "Jurassic Park" than the
                    giant T-Rex, Zelenitsky said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But at roughly 11 years old, as the tyrannosaurs hit their
                    middle-age, their bodies grew almost ten times in size,
                    ending up weighing more than 3,000 kilograms (6,600 pounds).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These kind of drastic dietary changes are not
                    necessarily rare in the animal kingdom—crocodiles and Komodo
                    dragons start out eating insects before switching to rodents
                    and eventually large mammals, Therrien said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers said the Gorgosaurus fossil supports the
                    theory that young tyrannosaurs—including the T-Rex—filled a
                    role in the food chain known as "mesopredators", before
                    later growing into apex predators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This change is "probably the reason why tyrannosaurs were so
                    successful and dominated their ecosystems at the end of the
                    Cretaceous in North America and Asia," Therrien said.

                    20 years ago, I got in a (friendly) public spat with Chris
                    Anderson, who was then the editor in chief of Wired. I'd
                    publicly noted my disappointment with glowing Wired reviews
                    of DRM-encumbered digital devices, prompting Anderson to
                    call me unrealistic for expecting the magazine to condemn
                    gadgets for their DRM:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I replied in public, telling him that he'd misunderstood.
                    This wasn't an issue of ideological purity – it was about
                    good reviewing practice. Wired was telling readers to buy a
                    product because it had features x, y and z, but at any time
                    in the future, without warning, without recourse, the vendor
                    could switch off any of those features:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I proposed that all Wired endorsements for DRM-encumbered
                    products should come with this disclaimer:
                  </p>

                    for its efforts to monopolize tractor repair. The lawsuits
                    noted that the company consistently purchased competing
                    repair centers in order to consolidate the sector and force
                    customers into using the company’s own repair facilities,
                    driving up costs and logistical hurdles dramatically for
                    farmers.

                    The market isn’t going to fix this problem by itself. It’s
                    clearly going to require a combination of antitrust reform,
                    regulatory action, new state/federal legislation, and
                    meaningful class action penalties before John Deere
                    executives finally get the message. And unfortunately for
                    them, right to repair reform continues to see stunning
                    levels of bipartisan public support.

                    Stealthy and multifunctional Linux malware that has been
                    infecting telecommunications companies went largely
                    unnoticed for two years until being documented for the first
                    time by researchers on Thursday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers from security firm Group-IB have named the
                    remote access trojan “Krasue,” after a nocturnal spirit
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasue"
                      >depicted in Southeast Asian folklore
                    </a>
                    “floating in mid-air, with no torso, just her intestines
                    hanging from below her chin.” The researchers chose the name
                    because evidence to date shows it almost exclusively targets
                    victims in Thailand and “poses a severe risk to critical
                    systems and sensitive data given that it is able to grant
                    attackers remote access to the targeted network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] During the initialization phase, the rootkit conceals
                    its own presence. It then proceeds to hook the
                    <b>`kill()`</b> syscall, network-related functions, and file
                    listing operations, thereby obscuring its activities and
                    evading detection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers have so far been unable to determine
                    precisely how Krasue gets installed. Possible infection
                    vectors include through vulnerability exploitation,
                    credential-stealing or -guessing attacks, or by unwittingly
                    being installed as trojan stashed in an installation file or
                    update masquerading as legitimate software.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Besides the rootkit functions, Krasue features an
                    installation file that's shielded inside a UPX, a so-called
                    packer that provides a cryptographic wrapper around the main
                    executable that can stymie detection by anti-virus software.
                    The Group-IB post provides indicators of compromise and
                    digital characteristics for detecting infected systems.

                    In the case of a captured asteroid origin, however, we are
                    more likely to find material on Phobos that is found on
                    other asteroids in our solar system. The prevailing
                    hypothesis in the #TeamCapture group is that the moons are
                    made up of the same rock as meteorites, called

                    Comparing meteorites and material brought back from Phobos
                    will be a fantastic tool for helping us understand the
                    origin of the two moons. Once we have material in the
                    laboratory, rigorous analytical techniques can be applied to
                    the samples.

                    are already firmly crossed for a successful launch, sample
                    acquisition, and sample return. Many scientists including
                    myself would absolutely love the possibility of one day
                    studying those samples.

                    That means that, in total, emissions from fossil fuels were
                    millions of times higher than carbon removal levels this
                    year. That ratio shows that it's "infeasible" for carbon
                    removal technologies to balance out emissions, O'Sullivan
                    says: "We cannot offset our way out of this problem."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The report also had bad news about nature-based approaches.
                    Efforts to pull carbon out of the atmosphere with methods
                    like reforestation and afforestation (in other words,
                    planting trees) accounted for more emissions removed from
                    the atmosphere than their technological counterparts.
                    However, even those efforts are still being canceled out by
                    current rates of deforestation and other land-use changes.

                  <p>
                    "The only way to solve this crisis is with major changes to
                    the fossil-fuel industry," O'Sullivan says. Technologies
                    like carbon removal "only become important if emissions are
                    drastically cut as well."

                    In August of 2023 EFF announced the
                    <a href="https://toruniversity.eff.org/"
                      >Tor University Challenge</a
                    >, a campaign to get more universities around the world to
                    operate Tor relays. The primary goal of this campaign is to
                    strengthen the Tor network by creating more high bandwidth
                    and reliable Tor nodes. We hope this will also make the Tor
                    network more resilient to censorship since any country or
                    smaller network cutting off access to Tor means it would be
                    also cutting itself off from a large swath of universities,
                    academic knowledge, and collaborations.

                So far they have established contact with more pre-existing
                relays at universities, increased the number of relays in
                general running at universities, and cultivated better contact
                with the national-level university Internet connectivity
                organizations (NRENs). Some of the institutions have established
                public relays, and others even added new exit relays.

                    worked. We had lots of margin on that main chute. It landed
                    safely—a beautiful pinpoint landing in the Utah desert."<br />[...]<br />"In
                    the design plans for the system, the word 'main' was used
                    inconsistently between the device that sends the electric
                    signals, and the device that receives the signals," NASA
                    said in a written statement. "On the signal side, 'main'
                    meant the main parachute. In contrast, on the receiver side
                    'main' was used as a reference to a pyrotechnic that fires
                    to release the parachute canister cover and deploy the

                    by VideoCardz—where it accuses AMD of selling "snake oil" by
                    using older processor architectures in ostensibly "new"

                    The "Core Truths" deck takes particular issue with the Ryzen
                    7020 series, released in late 2022 and into 2023 but using
                    Zen 2-based CPU cores that date back to mid-2019. Intel
                    argues, not inaccurately, that a 13th-generation Core
                    i5-1335U chip can perform much better than a Ryzen 5 7520U,
                    despite both being marketed as recent releases.

                    to back up its argument.<br />[...]<br />My second reaction,
                    arrived at almost simultaneously, was to wonder why Intel
                    was taking so much issue with a practice that Intel itself
                    regularly uses to "refresh" its processor lineups.<br />[...]<br />"Rebranding
                    old technology to make it seem newer" is a trick that
                    practically all big chipmakers have resorted to at one time,
                    and Intel has a particularly rich history with it. The
                    mid-to-late-2010s manufacturing problems that lost Intel its
                    chipmaking technology lead also resulted in a whopping

                    [...] It's clear to me from my experience that this
                    treatment is not made for everyone, though. To receive
                    exa-cel, I spent a total of 17 weeks in the hospital. Not
                    everyone will want to subject themselves to such a grueling
                    process or be able to take time away from family obligations
                    or work. And my treatment was free as part of the trial—if
                    approved, exa-cel could cost millions of dollars per
                    patient.

                    [...] The options for treating sickle cell disease are very
                    limited. Denying access to such a powerful and
                    transformative treatment based on someone's ability to pay,
                    or where they happen to live, strikes me as unethical. I
                    believe patients and health-care providers everywhere
                    deserve to know that the treatment will be available to
                    those who need it.

                    [...] Even as a direct beneficiary of gene therapy, I often
                    struggle with not knowing the full consequences of my
                    actions. I fundamentally, at a cellular level, changed who I
                    am. Where do we draw the line at playing God? And how do we
                    make the benefits of a God-like technology such as this more
                    widely available?

                Just when you thought the Do-Not-Track (DNT) privacy setting was
                gathering dust, a court in Berlin, Germany decided to exhume it.
                The Berlin Regional court ruled in favor of the Federation of
                German Consumer Organization (Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband,
                vzbv), in their lawsuit against LinkedIn for ignoring users who
                had enabled 'Do-Not-Track' in their browsers. According to the
                German judge, companies must respect DNT settings under the
                General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Different from the highly intrusive, often full-screen, GDPR
                    consent pop-ups that need to be addressed on each website
                    you visit, DNT is a single setting in your web browser that
                    works across all websites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a time where your every click is often scrutinized for
                    data collection or targeted ads, DNT puts the power of
                    privacy back in your hands. With this privacy flag, you're
                    able to browse the web on your terms while not having to
                    worry about who gets access to your personal information in
                    the process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ideally, websites should only prompt for permissions
                    contextually. For instance, it makes sense to ask for
                    permissions to share data with YouTube when you click play
                    on an embedded YouTube video. Also, well-designed websites
                    would ideally host videos themselves or use embedding
                    services that offer more control over privacy and data
                    collection than Google and its services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also, DNT does have its limitations because of its voluntary
                    nature because at the end of the day, websites can choose
                    whether or not to respect your request. It creates a
                    scenario similar to having a 'Keep Out' sign – some will
                    respect the warning and others will ignore it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, in light of the recent ruling in the Berlin
                    Regional Court against LinkedIn, this is a huge turning
                    point in the DNT initiative. This means LinkedIn can no
                    longer ignore its users' tracking preferences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This ruling potentially creates a legal implication that a
                    DNT signal is legally binding and must be respected by
                    websites.

                    One attraction of Binance, as the company grew from its 2017
                    founding into the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the
                    world, was the firm's freewheeling flouting of rules. As it
                    amassed well over 100 million crypto-trading users globally,
                    it openly told the United States government that, as an
                    offshore operation, it didn't have to comply with the
                    country's financial regulations and money-laundering laws.

                    [....] Connecticut-based Pioneer has developed parachutes
                    for space and other applications for decades. That work
                    ranged from parafoils developed in the 1960s for potential
                    use on Gemini spacecraft to parachutes flown on Mars lander
                    missions and the OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule. It also
                    supplied drogue chutes for SpaceX's Crew Dragon and its
                    cargo variant.

                    deal was likely an effort to preserve SpaceX's supply chain,
                    speculating that the cost to acquire Pioneer out of
                    bankruptcy may have been less than what SpaceX would have
                    spent on finding a new drogue chute supplier and
                    requalifying that component for use on crewed missions.

                (USWDS) guides those building US government web sites, but the
                influence extends much further in practice:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    With such a continuing free-fall, Firefox is inevitably
                    nearing the point where USWDS will remove it, like Internet
                    Explorer before it, from the list of supported browsers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "So what?" you may wonder. "That's just for web developers
                    in the U.S. government. It doesn't affect any other web
                    devs."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Actually, it very well could. Here's how I envision the
                    dominoes falling:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Once Firefox slips below the 2% threshold in the
                      government's visitor analytics, USWDS tells government web
                      devs they don't have to support Firefox anymore.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When that word gets out, it spreads quickly to not only
                      the front-end dev community but also the corporate IT
                      departments for whom some web devs work. Many corporations
                      do a lot of business with the government and, thus,
                      whatever the government does from an IT standpoint is
                      going to influence what corporations do.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Corporations see this change as an opportunity to lower
                      dev costs and delivery times, in that it provides an
                      excuse to remove <em>some</em> testing (and, in rare
                      cases, specific coding) from their development
                      workflow.<sup

                It also matters a lot in another way because without push back,
                due to either lack of will or lack of ability, there is not a
                counter balance to Google's Chromium / Chrome and thus the web
                has started to become[<i>sic</i>] under full control of a single
                entity, and a[<i>sic</i>] one which is a corporation at that.

                For those that have been following the saga, the CEO of Mozilla
                Corporation has maneuvered the once great browser from being a
                major presence to being barely a statistical error in market
                share. During that time Mozilla has also shifted from having a
                diverse funding base to being more or less fully financially
                dependent on its most serious competitor, Google.

                    Mr Krupski said he had found evidence in company data which
                    suggested that requirements relating to the safe operation
                    of vehicles that had a certain level of autonomous or
                    assistive-driving technology had not been followed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He added that even Tesla employees had spoken to him about
                    vehicles randomly braking in response to non-existent
                    obstacles - known as "phantom braking". This also came up in
                    the data he obtained around customer complaints.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mr Krupski said he had felt compelled to share what he had
                    found with data protection authorities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The US Department of Justice have been investigating Tesla
                    over its claims relating to its assisted driving features
                    since January.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tesla has also faced similar probes and questions from
                    agencies including the National Highway Traffic Safety
                    Administration about its autopilot system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    German newspaper Handelsblatt published the "Tesla Files"
                    after Mr Krupski shared 100GB of internal data he
                    discovered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The data protection authority in the Netherlands, where
                    Tesla's European headquarters are based, confirmed to the
                    BBC it had been notified of the data breach and was looking
                    into the claim.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [... ] Mr Krupski said the last six months and experience of
                    being a whistleblower had been "terrifying".
                  </p>
                  <p>"I barely sleep at night sometimes," he told the BBC.</p>
                  <p>
                    But his actions have been recognised by others - he has been
                    awarded the Blueprint for Free Speech Whistleblowing Prize.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jack Stilgoe, an associate professor at University College
                    London who researches autonomous vehicles, said Mr Krupski's
                    claims raised wider concerns about the technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is a sort of test case of artificial intelligence in
                    the wild, on the open road, surrounded by all the rest of
                    us," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The UK Government announced plans for an Automated Vehicles
                    Bill to outline a legal framework for self-driving cars in
                    the King's Speech in early November.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We'll have to see as the bill gets developed whether it
                    grapples with all of the novel things about the technology,"
                    Prof Stilgoe added.

                    Search vs. browse is a false dichotomy, since users employ
                    both strategies to achieve highly overlapping goals. For
                    example, a user looking for men's shoes on an ecommerce site
                    can either type the query "mens shoes" into the search box
                    or browse through the category hierarchy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In fact, the strategies that users employ often depend as
                    much on application design as on their personal preferences.
                    A larger, more prominent search box encourages search, while
                    a more prominent link to to view the category hierarchy
                    encourages browse. Autocomplete design can have a big impact
                    too — particularly the decision of whether or not to present
                    category browse pages as autocomplete suggestions. Also,
                    some applications redirect common keyword queries to browse
                    pages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So we should not assume that users set out to search vs.
                    browse.

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    One of the worse consequences of the sharp distinction
                    between search and browse is that two different teams tend
                    to be responsible for them — and sometimes those teams even
                    compete for glory and resources. Remember: it's not about
                    you or your organization. It's about helping users find what
                    they are looking for. So make sure that your org structure,
                    analytics, and other internal processes don't get in the way
                    of helping your users achieve their goals — through search,
                    browse, or both.

                In the early days of autonomous driving development, there was
                some press about researchers using the "trolley problem" (kill
                one person "on purpose" vs "do nothing" and kill many) to think
                about how robot cars should work. Now researchers at North
                Carolina State U have broken that big moral question down into
                smaller, more mundane pieces, in an attempt to see what ordinary
                human drivers think and do. Press release at:

                <div>
                  <p>
                    ... "The typical situation comprises a binary choice for a
                    self-driving car between swerving left, hitting a lethal
                    obstacle, or proceeding forward, hitting a pedestrian
                    crossing the street. However, these trolley-like cases are
                    unrealistic. Drivers have to make many more realistic moral
                    decisions every day. Should I drive over the speed limit?
                    Should I run a red light? Should I pull over for an
                    ambulance?"<br />[...]<br />"For example, if someone is
                    driving 20mph over the speed limit and runs a red light,
                    then they may find themselves in a situation where they have
                    to either swerve into traffic or get into a collision.
                    There's currently very little data in the literature on how
                    we make moral judgments about the decisions drivers make in
                    everyday situations."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To address that lack of data, the researchers developed a
                    series of experiments designed to collect data on how humans
                    make moral judgments about decisions that people make in
                    low-stakes traffic situations. The researchers created seven
                    different driving scenarios, such as a parent who has to
                    decide whether to violate a traffic signal while trying to
                    get their child to school on time. Each scenario is
                    programmed into a virtual reality environment, so that study
                    participants engaged in the experiment have audiovisual
                    information about what drivers are doing when they make
                    decisions, rather than simply reading about the scenario.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For this work, the researchers built on something called the
                    Agent Deed Consequence (ADC) model, which posits that people
                    take three things into account when making a moral judgment:
                    the agent, which is the character or intent of the person
                    who is doing something; the deed, or what is being done; and
                    the consequence, or the outcome that resulted from the deed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers created eight different versions of each traffic
                    scenario, varying the combinations of agent, deed and
                    consequence. For example, in one version of the scenario
                    where a parent is trying to get the child to school, the
                    parent is caring, brakes at a yellow light, and gets the
                    child to school on time. In a second version, the parent is
                    abusive, runs a red light, and causes an accident. The other
                    six versions alter the nature of the parent (the agent),
                    their decision at the traffic signal (the deed), and/or the
                    outcome of their decision (the consequence).

              <p>
                To date they have done small pilot studies, next is a much
                larger study with thousands of human subjects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Do we want robot cars to make the same routine decisions that
                some average human makes? I think it's a given that following
                some traffic rules (eg, speed limit) to the letter is likely to
                foul up traffic in many situations. How about in other
                situations?

                    Researchers have generally said that state-of-the-art
                    error-correction techniques will require more than 1,000
                    physical qubits for each logical qubit. A machine that can
                    do useful computations would then need to have millions of
                    physical qubits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But in recent months, physicists have grown excited about an
                    alternative error-correction scheme called quantum
                    low-density parity check (qLDPC). It promises to cut that
                    number by a factor of 10 or more, according to a preprint by
                    IBM researchers[1]. The company says it will now focus on
                    building chips designed to hold a few qLDPC-corrected qubits
                    in just 400 or so physical qubits, and then networking those
                    chips together.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The IBM preprint is “excellent theoretical work”, says
                    Mikhail Lukin, a physicist at Harvard University in
                    Cambridge, Massachusetts. “That being said, implementing
                    this approach with superconducting qubits seem to be
                    extremely challenging and it will likely take years before
                    even a proof-of-concept experiment can be tried in this
                    platform,” Lukin says. Lukin and his collaborators conducted
                    similar study on the prospect to implement qLDPC using
                    individual atoms instead of superconducting loops2.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The catch is that the qLDPC technique requires each qubit to
                    be directly connected to at least six others. In typical
                    superconducting chips, each qubit is connected only to two
                    or three neighbours. But Oliver Dial, a condensed-matter
                    physicist and chief technology officer of IBM Quantum, at
                    IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights,
                    New York, says that the company has a plan: it will add a
                    layer to the design of its quantum chips, to allow the extra
                    connections required by the qLDPC scheme.

                    A new IBM road map on the its quantum research unveiled
                    today sees it reaching useful computations — such as
                    simulating the workings of catalyst molecules — by decade’s
                    end. “It’s always been the dream, and it’s always been a
                    distant dream,” says Dial. “Actually having it come close
                    enough that we can see the path from where we are today for
                    me is enormous.”

              <p>
                        My car cost $40,000. It's absolutely the nicest,
                roomiest (except for the minivans) car I ever owned. My Dad had
                a Checker when I was about ten, they no longer make them. They
                were designed for taxicabs and I've never seen more back seat
                leg room than in one. My new Hyundai has more leg room except
                Dad's Checker than any other car I've ever seen, and although
                the '74 LeMans was a much bigger car, my new EV is much roomier.
                It's a lot roomier than the '02 Concorde that was the same size
                as my new car on the outside. Why aren't the auto companies
                advertising how roomy EVs are? I never realized how much space
                engines, transmissions, and gas tanks take up.
              </p>
              <p>
                        I started trying to buy one when I realized that you
                don't have to babysit them when you're charging. I didn't want
                to stand there in the snow filling a gas tank, but judging from
                most Facebook comments I've seen, I must be the only one who
                realized that. People seem to think you have to stand there when
                they charge. Why aren't they advertising this benefit?
              </p>
              <p>
                        Why aren't they telling you that your car can now heat
                your garage, unlike a piston car? Why aren't they advertising
                the fact that rather than the heat coming on when you get to
                where you're going, you have heat before you're out of the
                driveway?
              </p>
              <p>
                        Why aren't they telling you how well EVs handle, thanks
                to its crazy low center of gravity? Or how much faster they can
                stop, thanks to having two sets of brakes?
              </p>
              <p>
                        Why aren't they advertising the fact that electricity is
                five times cheaper than gasoline and diesel? The only way I
                found out was by buying one.
              </p>
              <p>
                        Why aren't they advertising all the advantages of EVs?
              </p>
              <p>
                        Why are only the top of the line autos like the Mustang
                or Cadillac EVs? That's an easy question to answer. The
                automakers are under laws from our and other governments that
                their fuel mileage average of all the vehicles they sell has to
                be under a certain number. The easiest way to do that is to make
                the expensive cars, the ones with big V-8s, electric. When your
                fastest car doesn't use traditional fuel...
              </p>
              <p>
                        But this, of course, begs a second question: why only
                the expensive ones? Because they don't want to make electric
                cars at all. The obvious reason is that they hate EVs. But why
                do they hate them and love the incredibly inefficient (my car
                will go 20 miles on the electricity it takes to refine a gallon
                of gasoline), obsolete Rube Goldberg device with thousands of
                moving parts to wear and break?

                        EVs threaten their business model. The businesses are
                set up so that GM makes almost as much profit from aftermarket
                parts, like spark plugs, belts, hoses, pumps, and so forth as
                they do on the cars themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                        Gasoline and diesel vehicles all need periodic
                maintenance. They're needy things, expensive to maintain, and
                the car company gets a cut of every repair of every car they
                sell. The drive train is a Rube Goldberg mess with thousands of
                moving, interlocking parts, any one of which fails can cripple
                the vehicle. A bad fuel pump stranded me in the bad part of town
                last year, and the repair was nearly $900 not counting the
                towing charge. The repair shop got half, Pontiac and other
                companies got the rest.
              </p>
              <p>
                        My new car doesn't have a fuel pump. Or spark plugs, or
                belts, or fuel injectors, or any of the other moving parts all
                the other cars I've owned since 1968 had and needed replacing.
                The motor's shaft IS its drive train! When was the last time
                your ceiling fan needed servicing?
              </p>
              <p>
                        More than likely that new 1976 Vega that cost $3,000
                garnered more than that for GM in aftermarket parts. There may
                still be some on the road still earning money for GM. An EV has
                few aftermarket parts; tires, brake pads, windshield wiper
                blades are all I can think of. Hyundai won't make any more money
                from my new EV like they would if it had a big six cylinder
                piston engine.
              </p>
              <p>
                        Which is a shame, because electric motors are all far,
                far superior to piston engines and transmissions in every way.
                But the nearly zero cost of maintenance is why the thieving
                billionaire car companies don't want to sell affordable EVs. In
                fact, they want to sell as few EVs as possible. If it wasn't for
                fuel mileage restrictions, Tesla and the Chinese would likely be
                the only electric cars you could buy.
              </p>
              <p>
                        But isn't this just a conspiracy theory? No, there was
                never a conspiracy, nothing needed to be said. Those people
                aren't moral, but they're not stupid, either. Ford and Chevy
                aren't making cars for a hobby, nor are they charitable
                organizations. All they care about is profit, and EVs threaten
                their gravy train.

                    It was back in 2022 when Broadcom, known for designing and
                    manufacturing semiconductor products, announced plans to buy
                    cloud computing and virtualization technology company VMware
                    in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at approximately $61
                    billion. The deal also sees Broadcom assuming VMware's $8
                    billion in debt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Broadcom said it had completed the acquisition of VMware
                    last November 22. As is often the case with mergers, one of
                    the first actions being taken by Broadcom is to implement
                    mass layoffs across the company it's just bought.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] If that isn't enough to anger VMware employees, those
                    who aren't being fired have been given an ultimatum by
                    Broadcom CEO Hock Tan: "If you live within 50 miles of an
                    office, you get your butt in here," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Collaboration is important and a key part of sustaining a
                    culture with your peers, with your colleagues," Tan added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    VMware has long been a remote-friendly company, a stark
                    contrast to Broadcom, which is so anti-work-from-home that
                    it ordered some employees back into the office in April
                    2020, despite California's stay-at-home orders.

                    details a new upgrade to Gmail's spam filters that Google is
                    calling "one of the largest defense upgrades in recent
                    years." The upgrade comes in the form of a new text
                    classification system called RETVec (Resilient &amp;
                    Efficient Text Vectorizer). Google says this can help
                    understand "adversarial text manipulations"—these are emails
                    full of special characters, emojis, typos, and other junk
                    characters that previously were legible by humans but not
                    easily understandable by machines. Previously, spam emails
                    full of special characters made it through Gmail's defenses
                    easily.

                  <p>
                    [...] Google says the efficiency here is a big deal.
                    Alternative approaches that used a "fixed vocabulary size"
                    or "lookup table" for homoglyphs made them very
                    resource-intensive to run. Imagine a list of every possible
                    spelling and misspelling of "congratulations" that swaps out
                    one or more characters for numbers, math symbols, Cyrillic,
                    Hebrew, or emojis and you have a nearly endless list. Google
                    says RETVec is only 200k "instead of millions of
                    parameters," so while Google's spam-filtering cloud is
                    probably big enough to run anything, this is small enough
                    that it could even run on a local device. RETVec

                    attacks, so even your local comment section could be running
                    it someday.

                    Spying and surveillance are different but related things. If
                    I hired a private detective to spy on you, that detective
                    could hide a bug in your home or car, tap your phone, and
                    listen to what you said. At the end, I would get a report of
                    all the conversations you had and the contents of those
                    conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put
                    you under surveillance, I would get a different report:
                    where you went, whom you talked to, what you purchased, what
                    you did.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before the internet, putting someone under surveillance was
                    expensive and time-consuming. You had to manually follow
                    someone around, noting where they went, whom they talked to,
                    what they purchased, what they did, and what they read. That
                    world is forever gone. Our phones track our locations.
                    Credit cards track our purchases. Apps track whom we talk
                    to, and e-readers know what we read. Computers collect data
                    about what we're doing on them, and as both storage and
                    processing have become cheaper, that data is increasingly
                    saved and used. What was manual and individual has become
                    bulk and mass. Surveillance has

                    Spying is another matter. It has long been possible to tap
                    someone's phone or put a bug in their home and/or car, but
                    those things still require someone to listen to and make
                    sense of the conversations. Yes, spyware companies like

                    After a spy camera designed to look like a towel hook was
                    purchased on Amazon and illegally used for months to capture
                    photos of a minor in her private bathroom, Amazon was sued.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The plaintiff—a former Brazilian foreign exchange student
                    then living in West Virginia—argued that Amazon had
                    inspected the camera three times and its safety team had
                    failed to prevent allegedly severe, foreseeable harms still
                    affecting her today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Amazon hoped the court would dismiss the suit,
                    <a
                      href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/west-virginia/wvsdce/3:2023cv00046/235914/24/"
                      >arguing</a
                    >
                    that the platform wasn't responsible for the alleged
                    criminal conduct harming the minor. But after nearly eight
                    months deliberating, a judge recently largely denied the
                    tech giant's motion to dismiss.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Amazon's biggest problem persuading the judge was seemingly
                    the product descriptions that the platform approved. An

                    included a photo from Amazon's product listing that showed
                    bathroom towels hanging on hooks that disguised the hidden
                    camera. Text on that product image promoted the spy cams,
                    boasting that they "won't attract attention" because each
                    hook appears to be "a very ordinary hook."

                    HP is squeezing more margin out of print customers, the
                    result of a multi-year strategy to convert unprofitable
                    business into something more lucrative, and says its
                    subscription model is "locking" in people.
                  </p>

                    [...] "We absolutely see when you move a customer from that
                    pure transactional model ... whether it's Instant Ink, plus
                    adding on that paper, we sort of see a 20 percent uplift on
                    the value of that customer because you're locking that
                    person, committing to a longer-term relationship."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] By pre-pandemic 2019, HP had grown weary of
                    third-party cartridge makers stealing its supplies business.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    HP also set in motion new subscriptions, and launched Smart
                    Tank hardware filled with a pre-defined amount of ink/toner.
                    These now account for 60 percent of total shipments.

                    Myers told the UBS Conference she was "really proud" that HP
                    could "raise the range on our print margins" based on "bold
                    moves and shifting models."
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    than a bottle of 1985 Dom Perignon. HP isn't alone in these
                    sorts of comparisons –

                  <p>
                    Something tells us that Myers' audience at the UBS gig might
                    not view the cost of printing the same way as the rest of
                    us.

                  <p>
                    Back in 2012, I decided to start this software development
                    blog. Because I am a do-it-yourselfer at heart, instead of
                    using Blogger or WordPress, I sat down and wrote my own blog
                    engine, using a then little known web framework called
                    Flask. I knew I wanted to code it in Python, and I first
                    tried Django, which was the most popular Python web
                    framework at the time. But unfortunately Django seemed too
                    big and too structured for my needs. I've found that Flask
                    gave me as much power, while being small, unopinionated and
                    unobtrusive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Writing my own blog engine was an awesome experience that
                    left me with a lot of ideas for topics I wanted to blog
                    about. Instead of writing individual articles about all
                    these topics, I decided to write a long, overarching
                    tutorial that Python beginners can use to learn web
                    development. And just like that, the Flask Mega-Tutorial was
                    born!

              <p>
                The double burial of an adult woman and an infant, dating to
                about 7000–6800 BCE, discovered in 1934 during construction
                works at the spa gardens of Bad Dürrenberg, is regarded as one
                of the outstanding burial finds of the Mesolithic in Central
                Europe. Because of the unusual equipment with the woman, who was
                buried in a seated position, and her bodily anomalies, the
                burial is interpreted as that of a shaman.
              </p>
              <p>
                Genetic research now reveals the relation of the woman and the
                child: the boy is not her son, but is a fourth- or fifth-degree
                relation. The phenotypic variants analyzed in the woman's genome
                inform us that she had a relatively dark skin complexion, dark,
                straight hair, and blue eyes.
              </p>
              <p>
                The unusual equipment buried with the woman comprises flint
                artifacts and solid rock tools, but also bone and antler
                artifacts, a piece of red ochre, a number of animal bones
                including the shell of at least three terrapins and partly
                pierced animal teeth. Together with deer antlers and originally
                six partly pierced boar's tusks, these finds are probably
                head/body ornaments. Due to the grave goods and bodily anomalies
                of the woman, the burial is interpreted as that of a shaman.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] Subsequent excavations at the site as part of the
                preparations for the State Garden Exhibition 2024 brought not
                only new revelations about the deposition and positioning of the
                body to light, but also revealed a multitude of new finds, which
                could be clearly attributed to the burial. Besides the pierced
                animal teeth, remains of fauna, lithic artifacts and a large
                amount of human skeletal remains could also be recovered.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the base of the skull, there is an anomaly at the edge of the
                great occipital hole, in the form of a small constriction. This
                area is the imprint of an abnormally developed blood vessel. The
                first cervical vertebra is incompletely formed due to a
                congenital growth defect and has only reached 40% of the arch.
                The rounded end of the vertebral arch corresponds to the
                previously observed defect at the large occipital hole.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] This can be caused intentionally by adopting a certain
                head posture. The consequences are unlikely to have been serious
                or hazardous to the person's health. However, it is conceivable
                that a nystagmus, i.e., an involuntary movement of the eyeballs,
                could be caused by the blockage of a blood vessel. This unusual
                feature might have been perceived as uncanny and when initiated
                on purpose may have reinforced or even justified her role as a
                shaman.

                  <p>
                    One of the most important discoveries of condensed matter
                    physics is that electrons lose their individuality in
                    solids. Electric interactions make the electrons combine to
                    form collective units. With enough energy, the electrons can
                    even form composite particles called plasmons with a new
                    charge and mass determined by the underlying electric
                    interactions. However, the mass is usually so large that
                    plasmons cannot form with the energies available at room
                    temperature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pines found an exception. If a solid has electrons in more
                    than one energy band, as many metals do, he argued that
                    their respective plasmons can combine in an out-of-phase
                    pattern to form a new plasmon that is massless and neutral:
                    a demon. Since demons are massless, they can form with any
                    energy, so they may exist at all temperatures. This has led
                    to speculation that they have important effects on the
                    behavior of multi-band metals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Demons' neutrality means that they do not leave a signature
                    in standard condensed matter experiments. "The vast majority
                    of experiments are done with light and measure optical
                    properties, but being electrically neutral means that demons
                    don't interact with light," Abbamonte said. "A completely
                    different kind of experiment was needed."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to Abbamonte, it was no accident that his
                    group discovered the demon "serendipitously." He emphasized
                    that he and his group were using a technique that is not
                    widely employed on a substance that has not been well
                    studied. That they found something unexpected and
                    significant is a consequence of simply trying something
                    different, he believes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It speaks to the importance of just measuring stuff," he
                    said. "Most big discoveries are not planned. You go look
                    somewhere new and see what's there."

                    [...] In addition to identifying potentially suitable
                    regions, Kamau also determined how production in each
                    individual area could be increased sustainably. "There are
                    two approaches to boosting production," she says. "The first
                    is extensification, which means expanding agricultural
                    areas. The other is intensification, i.e. ramping up
                    cultivation density. Depending on the region, diversified
                    farming practices can help make both extensification and
                    intensification more sustainable. But each approach has its
                    risks."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Which approach is more promising depends on the region in
                    question. Agricultural land in Western Europe, China, parts
                    of India and Brazil as well as Eastern Europe that is
                    already being intensively farmed could benefit from various
                    forms of extensification such as incorporating mixed
                    planting and lowering the cultivation density. While areas
                    in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Brazil, India, Tajikistan
                    as well as Canada, and Australia could benefit from
                    intensification according to the study. Other areas may be
                    suitable for both options, such as most parts of West
                    Africa.

                    Health data campaigners are preparing for a legal challenge
                    to the £330 million ($417 million) procurement of the
                    Federated Data Platform (FDP) by NHS England, awarded to US
                    spy-tech firm Palantir last month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The group led by Foxglove alleges there is no lawful basis
                    to create the FDP, as described in procurement documents,
                    within the current legal directions NHS Digital uses to
                    obtain and share data within the NHS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to NHS England, the "data platform" is the
                    software it plans to use to help NHS organizations collate
                    the operational data currently stored in separate systems in
                    order to help staff access the information they need. This
                    data includes the number of beds in a hospital, the size of
                    waiting lists for elective care services, or the
                    availability of medical supplies. The idea is every hospital
                    trust and integrated care system (ICS) will have their own
                    platform, but they will be able to connect and share
                    information between them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The controversial contract is set to last up to seven years.
                    NHS England said the new data platform would deliver better
                    joined-up care for millions of patients, help tackle waiting
                    lists, and reduce hospital discharge delays. Waiting lists
                    in the country have been at record levels since the
                    pandemic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In a statement to The Guardian, NHS England said it
                    has the legal authority to press ahead with the FDP without
                    further legislation and the legal concerns were "totally
                    incorrect."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An NHS spokesperson told the newspaper: "This letter
                    fundamentally misunderstands how the Federated Data Platform
                    will operate and is totally incorrect in both matters of law
                    and fact. The platform will use only existing data legally
                    collected by the NHS to support direct patient care, which
                    is lawful under all relevant data protection regulations."

                    is now working closely with Francesca, introduced the

                    But recently, the issue has reached a "tipping point," says
                    Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California,
                    Berkeley, because AI has grown much more sophisticated,
                    making the potential for harm much more serious. "The threat
                    vector has changed dramatically," says Farid. Creating a
                    convincing deepfake five years ago required hundreds of
                    images, he says, which meant those at greatest risk for
                    being targeted were celebrities and famous people with lots
                    of publicly accessible photos. But now, deepfakes can be
                    created with just one image.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Farid says, "We've just given high school boys the mother of
                    all nuclear weapons for them, which is to be able to create
                    porn with [a single image] of whoever they want. And of
                    course, they're doing it."

                    Clarke and Morelle, both Democrats from New York, have
                    reintroduced their bills this year. Morelle's now has 18
                    cosponsors from both parties, four of whom joined after the
                    incident involving Francesca came to light—which indicates
                    there could be real legislative momentum to get the bill
                    passed. Then just this week, Representative Kean, one of the
                    cosponsors of Morelle's bill, released

                    [...] Karen Barker, Head of Policy and Research at abrdn
                    Financial Fairness Trust, said, "It is particularly worrying
                    that many in serious financial difficulties continue to take
                    on debt just to pay for essentials. This group is also more
                    likely to borrow from friends and family, meaning their
                    loved ones may be going without to help keep them warm and
                    fed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Financial hardship has ripple effects through communities,
                    and in a small number of extreme cases, some of these
                    'friends' may actually be loan sharks. With headlines
                    showing January's energy bills are going to increase once
                    again, and government support for energy bills not available
                    this winter, there is a risk that those in serious financial
                    difficulties are going to be forced to fall even further
                    into debt to stay afloat."
