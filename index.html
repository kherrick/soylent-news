                    There was no indication of anything amiss on the infected
                    computer. Behind the scenes, however, the malicious payload
                    was not only intruding into some of the developer's most
                    private moments, but silently mocking the developer in
                    source code comments at the same time. Checkmarx explained:

                        The Discord bot includes a specific command to control
                        the computer's camera. It achieves this by discreetly
                        downloading a zip file from a remote server, extracting
                        its contents, and running an application called
                        WebCamImageSave.exe. This allows the bot to secretly
                        capture a photo using the webcam. The resulting image is
                        then sent back to the Discord channel, without leaving
                        any evidence of its presence after deleting the
                        downloaded files.

                      <p>
                        Among these malicious functions, the bot's malicious
                        humor emerges through messages that ridicule the
                        imminent destruction of the compromised machine. "Your
                        computer is going to start burning, good luck. :)" and
                        "Your computer is going to die now, good luck getting it
                        back :)"

                        But hey, at least there is a smiley at the end of these
                        messages.

                January 2024.
              </p>
              <p>
                Though the vast majority of people use the Standard view on
                their PCs without question, the HTML version of Gmail has its
                perks. The stripped-down Gmail experience loads quickly, and
                users can access it even on older machines or with much slower
                connections.
              </p>
              <p>
                The change appears to have been announced around September 19th
                in a Google support article, and users of the Basic HTML view
                were shown warnings that it will be discontinued, after which
                time they will be switched to the current standard view.
              </p>
              <p>
                The removal of Gmail's basic HTML view is the latest in a long
                line of products, features, services, and more to be admitted to
                the Google graveyard. The company has also recently buried its
                Pixel Pass phone upgrade program, Google Currents, and Nest
                Secure.

                    Amazon has been working on an in-house replacement for its

                    boasts, Roettgers writes that Amazon has been working on
                    Vega since at least 2019, is mostly done with the core
                    development, and is now focused on an SDK and developer
                    outreach. Vega would replace the Fire OS that is installed
                    on Fire TV sticks and televisions, Kindle Fire tablets, and
                    other Amazon devices. Vega, based on "a flavor of Linux,"
                    uses the popular JavaScript-based
                    <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a> as an
                    application framework. This could simplify development for
                    Fire devices alongside other React-ready platforms,
                    including smartphones, desktops, and other smart TVs.<br />[...]<br />While
                    an Android base provides a relatively familiar entry for
                    developers that already have Android apps, rebuilding the
                    AOSP project—meant to support a wealth of different devices
                    and carrying years of technical debt—seemingly became
                    frustrating enough for Amazon to push toward an in-house
                    solution.

                    The attack described in the paper published this month
                    clears the hurdle of missing key material exposed in faulty
                    SSH signatures by harnessing an advanced cryptanalytic
                    technique involving the same mathematics found in
                    lattice-based cryptography. The technique was first
                    described in 2009, but the paper demonstrated only that it
                    was theoretically possible to recover a key using incomplete
                    information in a faulty signature. This month's paper
                    implements the technique in a real-world attack that uses a
                    naturally occurring corrupted SSH signature to recover the
                    underlying RSA key that generated it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers traced the keys they compromised to
                    devices that used custom, closed-source SSH implementations
                    that didn't implement the countermeasures found in OpenSSH
                    and other widely used open source code libraries. The
                    devices came from four manufacturers: Cisco, Zyxel,
                    Hillstone Networks, and Mocana. Both Cisco and Zyxel
                    responded to the researchers' notification of the test
                    results before the completion of the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The important thing is that a single flip of a bit—in
                    which a 0 residing in a memory chip register turns to 1 or
                    vice versa—is all that's required to trigger an error that
                    exposes a secret RSA key. Consequently, it's crucial that
                    the countermeasures that detect and suppress such errors
                    work with near-100 percent accuracy. Ryan also said that
                    secret keys in post-quantum algorithms may be similarly
                    vulnerable to exposure caused by computational errors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our research reiterates the importance of defense in depth
                    in cryptographic implementations and illustrates the need
                    for protocol designs that are more robust against
                    computational errors, like is exhibited by TLS 1.3 or
                    certain configurations of IPSec," Ryan wrote. It
                    "illustrates the importance of protecting against
                    computational faults for any cryptographic implementation
                    going forward, even in usage scenarios where an attacker is
                    unlikely to have physical access."

                    The authors of the study therefore proposed a new hybrid
                    hypothesis for the origin of the Indo-European languages,
                    with an ultimate homeland south of the Caucasus and a
                    subsequent branch northwards onto the Steppe, as a secondary
                    homeland for some branches of Indo-European entering Europe
                    with the later Yamnaya and Corded Ware-associated
                    expansions. "Ancient DNA and language phylogenetics thus
                    combine to suggest that the resolution to the 200-year-old
                    Indo-European enigma lies in a hybrid of the farming and
                    Steppe hypotheses", remarked Gray.

                    Wolfgang Haak, a Group Leader in the Department of
                    Archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
                    Anthropology, summarizes the implications of the new study
                    by stating, "Aside from a refined time estimate for the
                    overall language tree, the tree topology and branching order
                    are most critical for the alignment with key archaeological
                    events and shifting ancestry patterns seen in the ancient
                    human genome data. This is a huge step forward from the
                    mutually exclusive, previous scenarios, towards a more
                    plausible model that integrates archaeological,
                    anthropological and genetic findings."

                    The recent transplant was performed by Eduardo Rodriguez,
                    director of the face transplant program and chair of the
                    department of plastic surgery at NYU Langone Health, and his
                    colleagues. The recipient was Arkansas-based military
                    veteran Aaron James, whose face touched a live wire while he
                    was working as an electrical lineman in Oklahoma in June
                    2021. The accident left him with severe burns to the left
                    side of his face, including his left eye, nose and lips, and
                    extensive damage to his left arm, his dominant limb. James
                    was transferred to a hospital in Texas, where he received
                    multiple reconstructive surgeries. His left eye was removed
                    because it was causing pain, and his left arm was amputated
                    above the elbow and fitted with a prosthetic hook. He was in
                    a medical coma for six weeks and he says he doesn't remember
                    anything from the accident and afterward until he woke up at
                    the hospital.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Two months after the accident, Rodriguez and his colleagues
                    at NYU Langone Health became aware of James's case. Over the
                    next year they discussed the possibility of a face
                    transplant with Aaron James and his wife, Meagan. The
                    decision was made to transplant the donor's eye as well,
                    because even if James never regained sight, the organ would
                    help restore his face's appearance. Like any transplant,
                    there was a chance his immune system would reject the
                    eye—but he would already need to take immunosuppressant
                    medication for the face transplant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] James has since made a good recovery. He is able to
                    talk, and although he does not have much ability to move his
                    lips and facial muscles yet, Rodriguez says he will recover
                    a lot of that ability with time. He can eat food on his own
                    again now, and his wife Meagan says he has a big appetite.
                    James was even able to attend his daughter's high school
                    graduation, and he says keeping his sense of humor has been
                    critical to his recovery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rodriguez and the rest of the surgical team are very pleased
                    with James's recovery. "Everything that we're seeing so far,
                    no one expected," he says. "Even if we don't get sight, I
                    will tell you at this point in time, everything seems
                    incredibly exciting."

                  <p>The "Man in the Moon" is older than we thought.</p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists have proposed resetting the lunar clock after
                    reassessing impact craters on the surface of the moon. This
                    means that some features of the moon, like the formation
                    that makes up the face of the "Man in the Moon" formation
                    could be 200 million years older than previously theorized.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new dating system could help to better tell the story of
                    the evolution of the lunar surface and has important
                    implications for our understanding of the violent and
                    turbulent early history of the solar system during which
                    bodies like Earth and the moon were subject to intense
                    bombardment by space rocks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new evaluation involved reexamining two separate ways of
                    dating the lunar surface: Counting the number of craters
                    caused by the impact of space rocks; and the assessment of
                    moon rocks collected by the Apollo missions. These two
                    dating methods have traditionally given different results,
                    especially for the ages of the heavily cratered and
                    mountainous highlands of the moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Looking at the signs of these impacts on the moon
                    shows what Earth would be like without the geological
                    churning of plate tectonics which took place here on Earth,"
                    Werner said. "What we have done is to show that large
                    portions of the lunar crust are around 200 million years
                    older than had been thought."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team behind the findings explains that the new dating
                    system doesn't change estimates of the moon's age as a
                    whole, which remains around 4.53 billion years. Instead, it
                    changes the age of all areas of the moon's surface but not
                    in a uniform way; the new dating system suggests older areas
                    are subject to the greatest shift in age due to the new
                    system.

                    [...] "Such a heavy bombardment period must have affected
                    the origin and early evolution of life on Earth and
                    potentially other planets such as Mars," Bouvier said in a
                    statement. "Bringing back rock samples from Jezero Crater on
                    Mars will be the next giant leap forward to search for signs
                    of ancient life on another planet in the solar system, and
                    when."

                    West Virginia University economists, whose research shows
                    flu deaths increase when a city becomes home to a new
                    professional sports team, say their data should make even
                    the biggest fans reconsider support for taxpayer-funded
                    stadium subsidies.
                  </p>

                    According to their paper in

                      >Sports Economic Review</a
                    >, U.S. cities that gained pro teams between 1962 and 2016
                    saw increased influenza mortality of up to 24% after the
                    teams came to town. The researchers analyzed cities with new
                    teams in the four major North American professional leagues:
                    Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the
                    National Basketball Association and the National Hockey
                    League.

                  <p>
                    [...] "Most, if not all, of the sports venues in the cities
                    we studied received direct and/or indirect public
                    financing," Humphreys said. "Since 2000, U.S. state and
                    local governments have committed nearly $20 billion to new
                    stadiums — roughly a billion dollars per year. These
                    subsidies usually come in the form of governments
                    essentially cutting team owners a check, funded by issuing
                    bonds, to build their stadiums. The fact that teams
                    basically extort cities to get these subsidies by
                    threatening to move elsewhere makes this of even more
                    interest to economists.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our finding, that people in cities with sports teams are
                    likely to be sicker than they would be without the team, has
                    the potential to shift how we think about hosting
                    professional sporting events. We hope taxpayers will be less
                    likely to subsidize professional sports facilities if they
                    realize those teams are making them sicker, burdening health
                    care systems and harming businesses' bottom lines as workers
                    use sick days."

                  <p>
                    When NFL teams moved to cities that never had pro sports
                    teams before, those cities saw an average increase in flu
                    deaths of 17%, or about 13 additional deaths a year.
                    Becoming home to an NBA team increased a city's flu
                    mortality by 4.7%, and MLB — whose games generally occur
                    outside flu season — had the smallest impact, driving three
                    additional deaths each year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The largest increase in a city's weekly flu mortality came
                    from the NHL. An NHL team moving into a city caused a 24.6%
                    increase in flu deaths per 100,000 residents, Ruseski said,
                    a total increase of about 20 flu deaths a year in each city.

                    "As for why hockey is so deadly, we believe it is both the
                    timing of the season and location of the teams," she said.
                    "The NHL season overlaps almost perfectly with the flu
                    season and NHL teams are more likely to be in colder

                  >YouTube's argument that banning ad blockers is done to help
                  content creators is disingenuous</b
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                YouTube's ban on ad blockers has been accompanied by increasing
                the frequency, duration, and intrusiveness of ads before and
                during videos. They have also raised the price of YouTube
                Premium, though the increased ads may be an effort to drive
                users to pay the higher subscription prices. YouTube justifies
                this as being necessary to support content creators. However,
                YouTube's policies toward content creators is exploitative, and
                YouTube is not comparable to other streaming services.
              </p>
              <p>
                Streaming platforms like Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime
                negotiate terms with their content providers, including the
                price of the content. YouTube does not negotiate with its
                content creators in the same way, and it has a history of
                changing the terms of its monetization programs in ways that
                adversely affect smaller channels. YouTube can also demonetize
                videos at their sole discretion.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am not suggesting that each content creator should get to
                negotiate their terms individually with YouTube. That's
                impractical. The problem is that YouTube has a de facto
                monopoly, meaning that content creators don't have viable
                alternatives to monetize their content on other platforms.
                Historically, YouTube had few ads and actually lost money, while
                potential competitors lost users because they had more
                advertising. Because YouTube has been successful in driving its
                competitors out of business through its anticompetitive
                behavior, content creators no longer have viable alternatives.
                There are a number of other video hosting sites, but they serve
                specific niches, have far fewer viewers, and hosting content on
                those services will generally be even less profitable for
                content creators. As such, YouTube can dictate terms to content
                producers with little recourse, which is not the case for other
                streaming services.
              </p>

                  privacy</b
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Don't forget, YouTube is owned by Google, which aggregates large
                amounts of data to serve people targeted advertisements. Google
                does not respect the privacy of users, and the ads you see on
                YouTube are generally targeted to you like any other ad Google
                displays. This is not necessary, and YouTube advertising might
                be more effective if it was contextual, primarily based on the
                content of the videos alongside which the ads are displayed.
                YouTube has chosen not to respect the privacy of its users. The
                collection and aggregation of data used to target ads is
                actively harmful to users and is all the more reason to continue
                blocking ads.
              </p>
              <p><b>YouTube has better solutions to many of its problems</b></p>
              <p>
                I believe that users are intelligent and understand that it is
                expensive for YouTube to host and distribute content, and that
                those bills need to be paid somehow. Instead of taking an
                adversarial position, YouTube should take users' concerns
                seriously and improve the quality of the ads they display. That
                means vetting ads before they're displayed to avoid NSFW content
                and obvious scams from being displayed to users. Many of the
                changes to YouTube's monetization system have been panned by
                content creators, and YouTube could show good faith by rolling
                back these changes and making it easier for small channels to
                monetize their content. YouTube could eliminate targeted
                advertising, automatically classify the content of videos, and
                only display contextual advertising. They could also offer
                intermediate options between being bombarded with massive
                amounts of ads and paying $13.99/month to remove all ads. For
                example, a cheaper plan could be offered to eliminate all
                mid-roll advertising, allowing some ads to remain while being
                much less obvious to users.

                    A pressing issue in Europe and the UK is the absence of
                    standardized regulations regarding these forever chemicals.
                    Only two of the most prevalent PFAS variants, PFOA and PFOS,
                    are currently monitored in the UK.

                    While the solution is complex, it is undoubtedly achievable.
                    We need stringent regulations, more research and a global
                    effort to eliminate PFAS. The pay off is worth it—a safer

                    In recent years, research showed that many professionals
                    consider their work to be socially useless. Various
                    explanations have been proposed for the phenomenon. The
                    much-discussed "bullshit jobs theory" by the American
                    anthropologist David Graeber, for example, states that some
                    jobs are objectively useless and that this occurs more
                    frequently in certain occupations than others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other researchers suggested that the reason people felt
                    their jobs were useless was solely because they were routine
                    and lacked autonomy or good management rather than anything
                    intrinsic to their work. However, this is only one part of
                    the story, as a recent study by sociologist Simon Walo of
                    the University of Zurich shows. It is the first to give
                    quantitative support to the relevance of the occupations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The original evidence presented by Graeber was mainly
                    qualitative, which made it difficult to assess the magnitude
                    of the problem," says Walo. "This study extends previous
                    analyses by drawing on a rich, under-utilised dataset and
                    provides new evidence. This paper is therefore the first to
                    find quantitative evidence supporting the argument that the
                    occupation can be decisive for the perceived pointlessness."
                    Walo also found that the share of workers who consider their
                    jobs socially useless is higher in the private sector than
                    in the non-profit or the public sector.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, Walo's study also confirms other factors that
                    influence employees' perceptions of their own work,
                    including, e.g., alienation, unfavorable working conditions
                    and social interaction. "Employees' assessment of whether
                    their work is perceived as socially useless is a very
                    complex issue that needs to be approached from different
                    angles," the author therefore concludes. "It depends on
                    various factors that do not necessarily have anything to do
                    with the actual usefulness of work as claimed by Graeber.
                    For example, people may also view their work as socially
                    useless because unfavorable working conditions make it seem
                    pointless."

                    [...] The changes mirror similar moves from others in the TV
                    maker industry.

                    Vizio has been shifting its business toward advertising for
                    the past few years. Its Q2 2023 earnings report showed its
                    ad business growing 28 percent compared to the same period
                    in 2022, versus a 15 percent increase for the device
                    business. The device business was still larger that quarter
                    ($252.1 million compared to $142.3 million), but it's clear
                    that the company is eyeing advertising as the way forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] TV giant LG is also moving that way, CEO William Cho
                    announced in July. In a press release that month, LG said it
                    "intends to transform its TV business portfolio into a
                    'media and entertainment service provider' by expanding
                    content, services, and advertisement in products."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And then there's Telly—the upcoming TV that has a second
                    screen geared toward showing advertisements, including if
                    the TV is turned off. The screen can also show other
                    content, like sports scores or the weather, but its primary
                    gimmick is that the device is given away for free. The cost,
                    instead, comes from a wealth of mandatory data collection
                    used for selling advertisements and products.

                    Amazon's Fire TV ad push is reflective of many parts of the
                    TV industry. With TV makers today increasingly focused on
                    selling ads on their devices, we'll continue seeing ads
                    stuffed into TV operating systems, potentially at the cost
                    of UI and hardware improvements. TV sellers, similar to the
                    streaming companies whose apps those TVs serve up, have
                    grown increasingly focused on pleasing advertisers and
                    investors with continuous growth and recurring revenue
                    sources. While those parties may smile, customers are left
                    stomaching more ads on TVs that are collecting more data on
                    them.

                    The groundbreaking Intel 386 processor (1985) was the first
                    32-bit processor in the x86 line. It has numerous internal
                    registers: general-purpose registers, index registers,
                    segment selectors, and more specialized registers. In this
                    blog post, I look at the silicon die of the 386 and explain
                    how some of these registers are implemented at the
                    transistor level. The registers that I examined are
                    implemented as static RAM, with each bit stored in a common
                    8-transistor circuit, known as "8T". Studying this circuit
                    shows the interesting layout techniques that Intel used to
                    squeeze two storage cells together to minimize the space
                    they require.

                    The global movement of the seas through tidal streams and
                    ocean currents generates a rich supply of energy that may be
                    transformed into a dependable and local renewable energy
                    source.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Aiming to further this mission, Swedish firm Minesto has now
                    completed onshore testing on its 1.2 MW Dragon 12 tidal
                    energy kite system. The system will be directly transferred
                    to the Faroe Islands in Denmark for installation and
                    commissioning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to the firm, its kite system technology is a
                    lightweight, flexible, and scalable solution to harvest
                    tidal energy, which unlocks a predictable renewable energy
                    resource.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The firm's power plant comprises a wing that houses a
                    <a
                      href="https://interestingengineering.com/culture/us-nuclear-launch-sites-threatened-wind-turbines"
                      >turbine</a
                    >
                    directly connected to a generator in a nacelle. The control
                    system directs the kite's trajectory by manipulating the
                    rudders and elevators at the back of the kite. The tether
                    holds the tether as well as communication and power lines.
                    The tether is attached to the seabed foundation via a simple
                    connection that is locked and unlatched for installation and
                    retrieval.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The kite is moved by the wing's utilization of the
                    hydrodynamic lift force provided by the underwater stream.
                    An onboard control system autonomously controls the kite in
                    a predefined figure-of-eight trajectory, dragging the
                    turbine through the water at a water flow several times
                    greater than the stream speed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The turbine shaft drives the generator, sending power to the
                    grid via a cable in the tether and a seabed umbilical to the
                    coast. According to Minesto, the subsea kite is intended to
                    fly in the opposite direction of the main flow, attaining a
                    relative speed several times that of the current rate.
                    Compared to a stationary turbine, this speed increase
                    minimizes the size of the kite and rotor necessary to
                    capture energy. As a result, it is inexpensive to install,
                    run, and maintain.

                    The evidence in this study supports the theory that the
                    first people living in the Americas came from Asia between
                    14,000 and 16,000 years ago and moved south into Central and
                    South America. However, other

                    NuScale Power and the Utah Associated Municipal Power
                    Systems announced Wednesday that they've agreed to terminate
                    the small modular reactor Carbon Free Power Project, or
                    CFPP.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Despite significant efforts by both parties to advance the
                    CFPP, it appears unlikely that the project will have enough
                    subscription to continue toward deployment. Therefore, UAMPS
                    and NuScale have mutually determined that ending the project
                    is the most prudent decision for both parties," NuScale and
                    UAMPS said in a press release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The project, which was expected to be the first
                    commercial SMR in the U.S. faced rising costs. In January,
                    NuScale raised the target price for power from the SMR to
                    $89/MWh from $58/MWh, citing a "changing financial landscape
                    for the development of energy projects nationwide."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite the termination of the CFPP, NuScale President and
                    Chief Executive Officer John Hopkins said Wednesday during
                    NuScale's Q3 earnings call that the company is focused on
                    deploying its SMR modules and is "poised to expand into new
                    markets, applications and capabilities." Hopkins highlighted
                    a number of other partnerships and projects, including plans
                    to develop two NuScale VOYGR-12 power plants that will have
                    a combined capacity of nearly 2 GW and power nearby data
                    centers in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Though there are risks to any project, the CFPP presented
                    unique challenges that NuScale does not expect will be
                    replicated with other customers," Diane Hughes, vice
                    president of marketing and communications at NuScale, said
                    in a statement to Utility Dive.

                    Industry groups expressed disappointment but understanding
                    of the decision.

                    Personal information that corporations collect from our
                    online behaviors sells for astonishing profits and
                    incentivizes online actors to collect as much as possible.
                    Every mouse click and screen swipe can be tracked and then
                    sold to ad-tech companies and the data brokers that service
                    them.

                  <p>
                    In an attempt to justify this pervasive surveillance
                    ecosystem, corporations often claim to de-identify our data.
                    This supposedly removes all personal information (such as a
                    person's name) from the data point (such as the fact that an
                    unnamed person bought a particular medicine at a particular
                    time and place). Personal data can also be aggregated,
                    whereby data about multiple people is combined with the
                    intention of removing personal identifying information and
                    thereby protecting user privacy.
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    However, in practice, any attempt at de-identification
                    requires removal not only of your identifiable information,
                    but also of information that can identify you when
                    considered in combination with other information known about
                    you. Here's an example:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      First, think about the number of people that share your
                      specific ZIP or postal code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Next, think about how many of those people also share your
                      birthday.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Now, think about how many people share your exact
                      birthday, ZIP code, and gender.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    According to one landmark study, these three characteristics
                    are enough to uniquely identify 87% of the U.S. population.
                    A different study showed that 63% of the U.S. population can
                    be uniquely identified from these three facts.

                    We cannot trust corporations to self-regulate. The financial
                    benefit and business usefulness of our personal data often
                    outweighs our privacy and anonymity. In re-obtaining the
                    real identity of the person involved (direct identifier)
                    alongside a person's preferences (indirect identifier),
                    corporations are able to continue profiting from our most
                    sensitive information. For instance, a website that asks
                    supposedly "anonymous" users for seemingly trivial
                    information about themselves may be able to use that
                    information to make a unique profile for an individual.

                    The US Commerce Department has promised to stop promoting
                    American-made commercial spyware to foreign governments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a letter sent to US Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), the federal
                    government dept finally provided details about the policies
                    adopted by its International Trade Administration (ITA)
                    intended to prevent any further promotion of US surveillance
                    technology overseas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For the first time the department is making clear that the
                    United States will not help companies find foreign markets
                    for products or services that undermine democracy or enable
                    repressive surveillance and discrimination," Wyden said in a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-successfully-presses-the-international-trade-administration-to-prevent-the-promotion-of-surveillance-technology-to-foreign-governments"
                      >statement</a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ITA, which is part of the Commerce Department, promotes
                    American goods and services abroad. In May, Wyden sent a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/26/wyden_ita_spyware_policy/"
                      >letter</a
                    >
                    to US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo demanding answers
                    about its pushing of commercial spyware overseas. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Last year, the ITA confirmed to Senator Wyden that it
                    has encouraged foreign governments to buy this type of tech,
                    but it refused to answer the senator's questions about which
                    products it endorsed and in which markets. The Department of
                    Commerce still seems to be stonewalling on both, but more on
                    that later.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Promoting the use of surveillance tech and spyware
                    under the guise of 'advocating for US businesses' smacks
                    uncomfortably of eroding global human rights for a profit,"
                    Schroeder said. "The very nature of the technology makes it
                    impossible to promote use of spyware in a way that does not
                    threaten human rights values." 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While a review process is "helpful," the US has no business
                    exporting things like spyware and facial recognition tech,
                    and others, including advanced data analytics and automated
                    license plate readers, should be added to the list, she
                    said. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We've repeatedly seen this technology abused and, once
                    exported, the ITA and the US as a whole has very little
                    control over whether it will be abused or fall into the
                    hands of repressive regimes," Schroeder said.

                    Imagine a skin cream that heals damage occurring throughout
                    the day when your skin is exposed to sunlight or
                    environmental toxins. That's the potential of a synthetic,
                    biomimetic melanin developed by scientists at Northwestern
                    University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new study, the scientists show that their synthetic
                    melanin, mimicking the natural melanin in human skin, can be
                    applied topically to injured skin, where it accelerates
                    wound healing. These effects occur both in the skin itself
                    and systemically in the body.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When applied in a cream, the synthetic melanin can protect
                    skin from sun exposure and heals skin injured by sun damage
                    or chemical burns, the scientists said. The technology works
                    by scavenging free radicals, which are produced by injured
                    skin such as a sunburn. Left unchecked, free radical
                    activity damages cells and ultimately may result in skin
                    aging and skin cancer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study, titled "Topical Application of Synthetic Melanin
                    Promotes Tissue Repair," is published Nov. 2 in
                    <em>npj Regenerative Medicine</em>.

                    Melanin in humans and animals provides pigmentation to the
                    skin, eyes and hair. The substance protects your cells from
                    sun damage with increased pigmentation in response to
                    sunlight—a process commonly referred to as tanning. That
                    same pigment in your skin also naturally scavenges free
                    radicals in response to damaging environmental pollution
                    from industrial sources and automobile exhaust fumes.

                    New research shows that a person's own behavior is the
                    primary driver of how they treat others during brief,
                    zero-sum-game competitions. Generous people tend to reward
                    generous behavior and selfish individuals often punish
                    generosity and reward selfishness – even when it costs them
                    personally. The study found that an individual's own
                    generous or selfish deeds carry more weight than the
                    attitudes and behaviors of others.

                    "The prevailing view before this study was that individuals
                    form expectations based on what they view as typical. If
                    everyone around me is selfish, then I'm going to learn to
                    accept selfishness and behave accordingly," Bogdan said.
                    "But we show that your judgments of other people's behavior
                    really depend on how you behave yourself."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Cultural norms toward self-interest or generosity do
                    influence people, as other studies have found, Florin Dolcos
                    said. "But we are not only observers. This study is showing
                    that we filter information about the world through our own
                    view."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those individuals whose behavior switched from generous to
                    selfish over time were more likely to punish generosity and
                    reward selfishness – but only after their own behavior
                    changed, the team found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This helps explain the phenomenon of social alignment, for
                    better and for worse, Florin Dolcos said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "You may have groups of selfish people who are more
                    accepting of other selfish people, and in order to be part
                    of that group, newcomers might display the same behavior,"
                    he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, the study finds that a person's own generous or
                    selfish nature drives their behavior in many arenas of life,
                    Sanda Dolcos said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is not just about decision-making," she said. "It has
                    practical relevance to many types of social interactions and
                    social evaluations."

                Former U.S. astronaut Frank Borman has died at the age of 95,
                NASA said on Thursday.
              </p>
              <p>
                He commanded the 1968 Apollo 8 mission that carried three
                astronauts farther from Earth than anyone had ever travelled.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm old enough to remember Apollo 8 (December 21–27, 1968, the
                first crewed spacecraft to leave low Earth orbit and the first
                human spaceflight to reach the Moon. The crew orbited the Moon
                ten times without landing, and then departed safely back to
                Earth. Three astronauts—Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William
                Anders—were the first humans to witness and photograph the far
                side of the Moon and an Earthrise.
              </p>
              <p>
                Born in Gary, Indiana, on March 14, 1928, he was the oldest
                American astronaut still living; that mantle now passes to Jim
                Lovell, who is also 95 but eleven days younger.

                    of the controls and protections Google has in place in

                    failed to pull the update when problems arose. Android has

                    Google's "boot failure" detection isn't accurate enough. The
                    company shipped a quick-fix patch via Google Play System
                    Updates in the Play Store, but because those passively wait
                    around for a reboot to get applied, users still got hit by
                    the bug days after that patch came out. Android is

                    well and isn't forced on every app, many users have no
                    backups at all.

                    We get sold technical explainers for all these features, but
                    when they were really needed, none of these poorly
                    thought-out, half-baked systems worked. This disaster is a
                    complete technical failure of several Android systems, and
                    many changes need to happen.

                    In a lengthy statement announcing the site's closure,
                    founder Leif K-Brooks reflected on how Omegle was meant to
                    connect people worldwide and "build on the things I loved
                    about the Internet." But, he added that a dark side of the
                    platform emerged.

                    "Virtually every tool can be used for good or for evil,"
                    Brooks wrote. "There can be no honest accounting of Omegle
                    without acknowledging that some people misused it, including
                    to commit unspeakably heinous crimes."

                    [...] As of Thursday morning, the Omegle website remained
                    live with Brooks' statement, but its online video chat
                    function was no longer visible.

                Astronomers have discovered evidence of a theorized type of
                black hole lurking in the distant universe. Known as an "Outsize
                Black Hole," this object could help explain some fundamental
                cosmic mysteries, including how supermassive monsters form.
              </p>
              <p>
                Black holes as we know them tend to fall into two categories:
                there's the stellar mass black holes, which as the name suggests
                have masses equivalent to a few stars. They form when large
                stars die in a supernova. Up the other end of the scale sits
                supermassive black holes, which contain the mass of millions or
                even billions of stars. These are found at the center of many
                galaxies, including our own.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was long thought that supermassive black holes form by
                growing out of stellar mass black holes as they slurp up matter
                over billions of years. This hypothesis was seemingly bolstered
                by recent observations of intermediate mass black holes, rare
                objects that slot in the middle of the mass range.
              </p>
              <p>
                But as astronomers peer farther away in space and time, they've
                increasingly spotted signs that the story isn't that simple. In
                2017, a black hole with a mass of 800 million Suns was
                discovered in a distant corner of space that meant it grew that
                big just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang – a
                growth rate that should be impossible according to our models.
                And it's far from alone, with over 100 contemporary giants found
                since then.
              </p>
              <p>
                One possible explanation is that some black holes may form
                through other methods, giving them a larger starting mass than a
                regular old supernova would allow. If massive clouds of gas
                collapse, the hypothesis goes, they could form black holes with
                masses between about 10,000 and 100,000 Suns.
              </p>
              <p>
                "There are physical limits on how quickly black holes can grow
                once they've formed, but ones that are born more massive have a
                head start," said Andy Goulding, co-author of the study. "It's
                like planting a sapling, which takes less time to grow into a
                full-size tree than if you started with only a seed."
              </p>
              <p>
                Now astronomers claim to have discovered the first evidence for
                just such an object, which they call an Outsize Black Hole. It's
                located in a galaxy called UHZ1, at the incredible distance of
                13.2 billion light-years from Earth – which also means we're
                seeing it as it was 13.2 billion years ago, or less than 500
                million years after the Big Bang.

                So in the National Archive in Kew (UK) they found a box of
                letters sent during the seven years' war between France and the
                UK. Long lost correspondence.

                Perhaps it's not that they are lost for 250ish years that is the
                interesting part. But how little things change. People still
                communicate about more or less the same things then as now, it's
                just the way we communicate that change for technological
                reasons.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nothing in there though if they tracked down the offspring,
                relatives etc of the letters and returned them to them. Guess
                that isn't a service offered.

                November 2, 1988 back when there were likely fewer than 100k
                systems connected to the Internet, though maybe even as few as
                60k. Some estimates suggest that around 1 out of 10 of those
                systems were infected, due to several holes in the target
                systems. Those which were infected ground to a halt due to a
                mistake in the worm itself.

                    those who lived through it. No major security incident had
                    ever occurred on such a scale before. The Worm was the top
                    news story in international media for days. The events

                    concern by authorities in the days following the Worm's
                    deployment regarding its origin and purpose. It seeded
                    significant changes in law enforcement, defense funding and
                    planning, and how we all looked at interconnectivity. In the
                    following years, malware (and especially non-virus malware)
                    became an increasing problem, from

                From a seasonal cold to a stomach bug, nobody likes catching a
                virus—and epidemics can be devastating. We need safe,
                sustainable antiviral options to treat the outbreaks of the
                future. Scientists in Finland have now shown that an extract of
                willow bark—a plant that has already provided several medicines,
                including the precursor to modern aspirin—has a broad-spectrum
                antiviral effect in cell sample experiments.
              </p>
              <p>
                The extract worked both on enveloped coronaviruses, which cause
                colds as well as COVID-19, and non-enveloped enteroviruses,
                which cause infections such as flu and meningitis. There are no
                clinically approved drugs that work against enteroviruses
                directly, so this extract could be a future game-changer.
              </p>
              <p>
                "We need broadly acting and efficient tools to combat the virus
                load in our everyday life," said Prof Varpu Marjomäki of the
                University of Jyväskylä, senior author of the study in Frontiers
                in Microbiology. "Vaccinations are important, but they cannot
                deal with many of the newly emerging serotypes early enough to
                be effective on their own."
              </p>
              <p>
                The scientists had previously tested willow bark extract on
                enteroviruses, and found it was highly successful. In this new
                study, they expanded the remit of their research to look at
                additional kinds of virus and to try to understand the mechanism
                of the extract's action.
              </p>
              <p>
                To make the extract, they harvested commercially grown willow
                branches. The bark was cut into pieces, frozen, ground, and then
                extracted using hot water. This produced the extract samples
                that the scientists tested against enteroviruses—strains of
                Coxsackievirus A and B—and coronaviruses—a seasonal coronavirus
                and COVID-19.

                    to unseal the amended complaint that the FTC still has to
                    prove that Kochava has violated the FTC Act, but its
                    arguments are sufficient to survive Kochava's motion for
                    sanctions, which the judge's order also denied.

                  <p>
                    According to Winmill, Kochava "has not offered any
                    compelling reason to maintain the amended complaint under
                    seal."

                    "Certainly, the FTC's allegations cast Kochava's services in
                    an unfavorable light," Winmill wrote. "But that is no reason
                    to shield the complaint from public view."

                So much for the temporary delay or ban on AI. Musk named his AI
                Grok. I'm surprised by the lack of X:es in the name. Perhaps it
                would have looked odd considering the name of the Musk AI
                Company is xAI.
              </p>
              <p>
                Somewhat unclear if the Grok is referring to Hitchhikers guide
                to the Galaxy Grok or to Heinleins Stranger in a Strange Land.
                If you take inspiration from Hitchhikers then it shouldn't be
                that hard to program. If all else fails, the answer to a query
                is always 42. So I guess we'll know what it will default to when
                it starts looping hallucinations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also Grok should apparently be really into sarcasm, so that will
                end well and not lead to any kind of misunderstandings or
                interpretations. None.

                    Chang noted that longer periods of sleep recovery may be
                    necessary to recover from multiple, consecutive nights of
                    sleep loss.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Sleep is a biological process, but it's also a behavioral
                    one and one that we often have a lot of control over," Chang
                    said. "Not only does sleep affect our cardiovascular health,
                    but it also affects our weight, our mental health, our
                    ability to focus and our ability to maintain healthy
                    relationships with others, among many other things. As we
                    learn more and more about the importance of sleep, and how
                    it impacts everything in our lives, my hope is that it will
                    become more of a focus for improving one's health."

                    All of the previous lanterns I've talked about use the flame
                    as a source of light - carbureted in various ways, but
                    "carbon in the flame glowing directly." A mantle is a device
                    that, when heated, glows brightly in the visible regions -
                    it puts out more light than a blackbody radiator at a given
                    temperature, because it uses materials that are low
                    emissivity in the infrared spectrum (heat), and high
                    emissivity in the visible spectrum (light, useful to
                    humans). There are also some benefits from helping contain
                    the flame and the heat within the enclosure, but the end
                    result is rather more light for a given amount of heat than
                    you'd otherwise get.

                I remember similar lanterns from my childhood, including the
                <a href="https://tilleylamp.co.uk/">Tilley Lamp</a>, but how
                many of our community have ever seen these lanterns anywhere
                other than on TV or in movies? Does anyone here still use a
                similar lamp? - JR

                    that time the KIM-1 was old, and definitely not state of the
                    art. After all, it was released in 1976.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it's a machine I enjoyed programming (which required
                    punching in code via the hex keypad, or, if you were lucky,
                    connecting a terminal (via a 20mA current loop designed to
                    talk to an actual Teletype) to it and using the very basic
                    monitor program). The KIM-1 could also interface to a
                    paper-tape reader/punch and a cassette for storing and
                    loading programs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have a tiny collection of machines that matter in my
                    personal computing history: a Sharp MZ-80K, a Research
                    Machines 380Z, a Research Machines 480Z, my original BBC
                    Micro and a KIM-1 (that's a picture of my machine above).
                    The (fully working) KIM-1 was made in 1976 and is serial
                    number 2,793. It's still sitting in its original packaging:

                    European space officials will convene on Monday and Tuesday
                    to discuss the future of space policy for the continent. The
                    "Space Summit" gathering in Seville, Spain, will encompass
                    several topics, including the future of launch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the decade since [the Ariane 6] agreement was
                    reached there have been at least three factors that have
                    precipitated a crisis in European launch. One is the rise of
                    SpaceX, which, through its reusable Falcon 9 rocket, has
                    come to dominate the commercial market with prices about
                    half those offered by the Ariane rockets. Because it has
                    optimized for speed, SpaceX can also launch far more
                    frequently and efficiently than Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Secondly, the Ariane 6 rocket has been delayed from its
                    original goal of launching in 2020. Now, if hot-fire tests
                    late this year go well, it is possible that the Ariane 6
                    rocket could make its debut launch by mid-2024, or about
                    four years late. With the retirement of the Ariane 5, and
                    the Russian Soyuz rocket off the market due to the war in
                    Ukraine, Europe finds itself in the embarrassing position of
                    having to rely on SpaceX to get some of its
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/07/europes-euclid-telescope-launched-to-study-the-dark-universe/"
                      >most valuable missions</a

                    into orbit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, there is the cost issue. The goal of reducing
                    operations costs by 50 percent has dropped to 40 percent.
                    And now, citing inflation, European officials say those cost
                    cuts are not sustainable. In fact, the Ariane 6 rocket's
                    primary contractor, ArianeGroup—which is co-owned by Airbus
                    and Safran—is asking for a significant subsidy to operate
                    the rocket.
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/10/oops-it-looks-like-the-ariane-6-rocket-may-not-offer-europe-any-launch-savings/"
                      >It wants 350 million euros a year</a
                    >, which would essentially wipe out any cost savings from
                    going to the Ariane 6 rocket.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So Europe has spent a decade and many billions of euros
                    developing the Ariane 6 rocket, but all it has gotten them
                    to date is a gap in the capability of launching satellites
                    to orbit. This has ratcheted up tensions heading into
                    Seville this week.

                    Representatives from 22 European countries reached an
                    agreement Monday to change the way the continent's rockets
                    are developed, moving from a government-driven approach to a
                    commercial paradigm that appears to be modeled after how
                    NASA and the US military do business.

                  Australia's news.com.au reports:</a
                ><br />During the Covid pandemic, restaurants introduced QR Code
                menu ordering in an attempt to minimize contact between staff
                and patrons. Australian restaurants have continued this trend
                while taking it to new levels of absurdity, sparking a recent
                flurry of criticism on social media.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I'm so f***ing tired of 'tech' being used to solve an 'issue'
                but only making everything worse and more inconvenient for
                everybody," one Aussie wrote. Followed by a deluge of replies
                and comments.
              </p>
              <p>
                His comment was in response to going to a restaurant and having
                only a QR code to order from - literally a menu at the table
                with only the QR code on it. The app required to order from it
                "proceeded to charge a 6.5% venue surcharge, a 2% payment
                processing fee, and then had the audacity to ask for a tip (10%,
                15%, 25%) as the cherry on top.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hundreds of others enthusiastically agreed and many added they
                also didn't like being asked to enter their personal details.
                "You're waiting your own table and paying an extra fee for the
                privilege. It's f***ed," one person responded. "It's also a big
                stinking FU to anyone old or not tech savvy. All just to hoover
                up your data," another added.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some, however, shared they preferred using QR codes to order
                their food - they removed the need to move to order more and
                limited engagement with staff. "I actually like the QR ordering
                because I don't like people, but the surcharges and tipping can
                f*** off," one said. "I love the QR codes - don't need to leave
                the table to order another beer," someone else wrote...
              </p>
              <p>
                Jonathan Holmes-Ross, owner of board game restaurant, The Lost
                Dice in Adelaide told news.com.au that the use of QR code
                ordering had let his eatery "reduce costs by around 25%... We no
                longer have to take orders, work out bills and manually take
                payments," he said. "This gives our wait staff more time to look
                after our customers, and the kitchen has excellent order
                information as the accuracy of the orders is great. We now have
                very few mistakes saving us time and waste. We can also mark
                items that have run out instantly on the app by using stock
                levels, again avoiding the disappointment of (the) customer."

                    Amazon and Meta have agreed to not use data collected from
                    their marketplaces to unfairly benefit themselves, the UK's

                    the Big Tech duo of not only gathering up information about
                    sellers using their respective online souks, they also -

                    In Amazon's case, the e-commerce giant used vendors' sales
                    figures to decide which items it should sell, and how much
                    to price products to get an edge over everyone else. The

                    charging extra costs if they wanted to use Amazon's Prime
                    delivery services, the CMA said.

                    the online souk will be prevented from using third-party
                    seller data that gives it an unfair commercial advantage,
                    and will allow rivals to negotiate rates with independent
                    delivery contractors working on behalf of Amazon.

                    The social media mega-corp was accused of exploiting
                    advertisers hawking wares on Facebook Marketplace, and using
                    competitors' data to improve its own products or services.

                  <p>
                    "Going forward, competitors of Facebook Marketplace that
                    advertise on Meta platforms can 'opt out' of their data
                    being used to improve Facebook Marketplace. Without these
                    measures in place, Meta risks having an unfair competitive
                    advantage that could distort competition," the CMA said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Having assessed the commitments and the feedback received,
                    including from sellers, advertisers and customers, we
                    believe both sets of commitments address the specific
                    competition concerns we had here in the UK," Ann Pope, the
                    watchdog's senior director for antitrust enforcement,
                    concluded.

                Youtubes anti-adblocking offensive appear to be working.<br />The
                developers of various adblockers are reporting record amounts of
                un-installation during October. A majority of the people
                uninstalling their adblockers claim that it is due to the
                Youtube crackdown.
              </p>
              <p>
                The cat-and-mouse game is sure to continue as new methods of

                    Previously unreported figures from ad blocking companies
                    indicate that YouTube's crackdown is working, with hundreds
                    of thousands of people uninstalling ad blockers in October.
                    The available data suggests that last month saw a record
                    number of ad blockers uninstalled - and also a record for
                    new ad blocker installs as people sought alternatives that
                    wouldn't trigger YouTube's dreaded pop-up.

                    Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a free alternative
                    that's guaranteed to work perfectly on an indefinite basis
                    right now.

                    One popular browser extension called
                    <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> seems
                    to be the easiest and best bet right now, with users
                    claiming it works best on Firefox (though it's worked for me
                    on Chrome, too).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some folks are switching browsers to Firefox or even
                    Microsoft Edge just to find a way to watch YouTube videos in
                    peace.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem with this is that YouTube will almost certainly
                    weed out working alternatives over time, so some degree of
                    adaptability may be required here on the user end. Or, you
                    could just give in and pay for YouTube Premium. It's not fun
                    or ideal, but you can at least guarantee it'll work.

                    of L3.

                    The other new chip in AMD's portfolio is the Ryzen 3 7440U,
                    which is a 4-core, 8-thread part with a base clock of 3GHz
                    and a boost clock of up to 4.7GHz. It has the same TDP range
                    of 15-30W as the Ryzen 5 part, but only offers 12MB of total
                    cache, including 8MB of L3. Like the 7545U, the 7440U also
                    comes with Radeon 740M integrated graphics.

                    The new hybrid core architecture has thrown a spotlight on
                    the new Zen 4c cores, with obvious questions about how they
                    differ from Zen 4. According to AMD, the new cores are
                    designed for density and power efficiency and are 35 percent
                    smaller than Zen 4. The new core architecture also offers
                    better scalability, with the potential for allowing higher
                    core counts in future high-end mobile processors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company claimed that Zen 4c is a great option for
                    entry-level devices, as the smaller cores with the same IPC
                    consume less power than Zen 4, allowing the chips to deliver
                    more performance below 15W. However, Zen 4 still supports a
                    higher absolute clock limit compared to Zen 4c, enabling the
                    new hybrid chips to offer optimized performance in heavy
                    workloads while delivering a high degree of efficiency.

                Sunflowers famously turn their faces to follow the sun as it
                crosses the sky. But how do sunflowers "see" the sun to follow
                it? New work from plant biologists at the University of
                California, Davis, published Oct. 31 in PLOS Biology, shows that
                they use a different, novel mechanism from that previously
                thought.
              </p>
              <p>
                "This was a total surprise for us," said Stacey Harmer,
                professor of plant biology at UC Davis and senior author on the
                paper.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most plants show phototropism—the ability to grow toward a light
                source. Plant scientists had assumed that sunflowers'
                heliotropism, the ability to follow the sun, would be based on
                the same basic mechanism, which is governed by molecule called
                phototropin and responds to light at the blue end of the
                spectrum.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sunflowers swing their heads by growing a little more on the
                east side of the stem—pushing the head west—during the day and a
                little more on the west side at night, so the head swings back
                toward the east. Harmer's lab at the UC Davis College of
                Biological Sciences has previously shown how sunflowers use
                their internal circadian clock to anticipate the sunrise, and to
                coordinate the opening of florets with the appearance of
                pollinating insects in the morning.

                    Whether we like it or not, we all use the cloud to
                    communicate and to store and process our data. We use dozens
                    of cloud services, sometimes indirectly and unwittingly. We
                    do so because the cloud brings real benefits to individuals
                    and organizations alike. We can access our data across
                    multiple devices, communicate with anyone from anywhere, and
                    command a remote data center's worth of power from a
                    handheld device.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But using the cloud means our security and privacy now
                    depend on cloud providers. Remember: The cloud is just
                    another way of saying "someone else's computer." Cloud
                    providers are single points of failure and prime targets for
                    hackers to scoop up everything from proprietary corporate
                    communications to our personal photo albums and financial
                    documents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It's not just attackers we have to worry about. Some
                    companies use their access—benefiting from weak laws,
                    complex software, and lax oversight—to mine and sell our
                    data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our message is simple: It is possible to get the best of
                    both worlds. We can and should get the benefits of the cloud
                    while taking security back into our own hands. Here we
                    outline a strategy for doing that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the last few years, a slew of ideas old and new have
                    converged to reveal a path out of this morass, but they
                    haven't been widely recognized, combined, or used. These
                    ideas, which we'll refer to in the aggregate as
                    "decoupling," allow us to rethink both security and privacy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here's the gist. The less someone knows, the less they can
                    put you and your data at risk. In security this is called
                    Least Privilege. The
                    <a
                      href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2022/papers/hotnets22_schmitt.pdf"
                      >decoupling principle</a
                    >
                    applies that idea to cloud services by making sure systems
                    know as little as possible while doing their jobs. It states
                    that we gain security and privacy by separating private data
                    that today is unnecessarily concentrated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The needed protocols and infrastructure exist, and
                    there are services that can do all of this already, without
                    sacrificing the performance, quality, and usability of
                    conventional cloud services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But we cannot just rely on industry to take care of this.
                    Self-regulation is a time-honored stall tactic: A piecemeal
                    or superficial tech-only approach would likely undermine the
                    will of the public and regulators to take action. We need a
                    belt-and-suspenders strategy, with government policy that
                    mandates decoupling-based best practices, a tech sector that
                    implements this architecture, and public awareness of both
                    the need for and the benefits of this better way forward.

                    Forty percent of parents who worked remotely during the
                    COVID-19 pandemic reported higher parenting stress compared
                    with only 27 percent of parents who worked onsite, reports a
                    new survey from scientists at Northwestern University and

                    The study results revealed a gender difference: Fathers who
                    worked from home were twice as likely to report that
                    parenting was stressful all or most of the time compared to
                    fathers who worked onsite. Parenting stress for mothers who
                    worked at home was slightly higher, but it did not reach
                    statistical significance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study found no differences in mental or general health

                    "Our survey results show that teleworking during the
                    pandemic was associated with more parenting stress,
                    especially for fathers," said lead author Dr. John James
                    Parker, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern
                    University Feinberg School of Medicine and a pediatrician at
                    Lurie Children's. "This might be a reflection of societal
                    expectations that men should prioritize work obligations
                    over family needs, which creates additional stress for
                    fathers working from home."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The study authors recommend parents reflect on their
                    family and work situation and try to find an arrangement
                    that limits stress and promotes well-being.

                    "This can be as simple as putting a noise-cancelling machine
                    in the workspace, rearranging schedules to limit
                    distractions and planning time for parents to step away from
                    work to be fully engaged with their children," said Parker,

                According to an observational study cats are found to have at
                least 276 different facial expressions combinations. That humans

                    Each of the cat's expressions was made up of a mix of four
                    out of 26 unique facial movements - things like open mouths,
                    wide or small pupils, blinks, nose licks, whisker movements,
                    and ear positions. By comparison, humans have around 44
                    unique facial movements, and dogs have 27, but the total
                    number of expressions isn't known. Of the recorded facial
                    expressions, around 45% were thought to be friendly, and 37%
                    were more aggressive or angry, with the leftover 18% an
                    unclear mixture of the two.

                    "Many people still consider cats—erroneously—to be a largely
                    nonsocial species," says Daniel Mills, a veterinary
                    behaviorist at the University of Lincoln who was not
                    involved in the study. The facial expressions described in
                    the new study suggest otherwise, he notes. "There is clearly
                    a lot going on that we are not aware of."

                    [...] Georgia Mason, a behavioral biologist at the
                    University of Guelph, says she was "very impressed" by the
                    new study. One day it might be used to design an app to help
                    cat owners better understand their pets' subtle cues, she
                    adds. "This could really help the cat-human bond."

                    X has banned the account of a prominent critic after he
                    published data that he claims exposed the site's embrace of
                    the far-right after Elon Musk's takeover last year.

                    months after his data formed the basis of

                    reports claiming that far-right influencers featured
                    prominently among Twitter Blue subscribers, and how
                    thousands of previously banned X accounts, including members
                    of the far-right, were being reinstated on the site.

                    On Tuesday, Brown announced his decision to challenge his
                    account's suspension in court in Berlin. "This is a matter
                    of principle," he says. "I think it is important that
                    platforms like Twitter are not allowed to shut down
                    criticism arbitrarily." X did not reply to repeated requests
                    for comment.<br />[...]<br />The legal proceedings in
                    Germany are ongoing. For Ballon, the best case scenario
                    would be if the court reinstates Brown's account again or
                    rules the block to be unlawful. The worst outcome would be
                    if the court declines to rule on the case because X's
                    European Union headquarters are based in Ireland. HateAid is
