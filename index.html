                    Patients often come into clinics on a grocery list of
                    medications. Common prescriptions include lisinopril 20 mg,
                    amlodipine 2.5 mg, metformin 500 mg, and aspirin 81 mg. One
                    dosage stands out from the others. While most medications
                    come in dosages of round numbers or common decimals,
                    low-dose aspirin has a standard dose of 81 mg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Why is aspirin available at a dose of 81 milligrams? The
                    answer is historical in nature and is rooted in a medieval
                    and now defunct system of measurement called the apothecary
                    system of weights and measures. The full explanation of
                    aspirin 81 requires some background information on the
                    apothecary system and is best explained in comparison to the
                    more familiar metric system.

                    Burning coal to generate electricity is on the way out in
                    the United States, but the nation's long dependence on the
                    fossil fuel took a devastating toll.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A new study determined for the first time that soot
                    pollution from coal-fired power plants is more dangerous
                    than soot from other sources. During the past two decades,
                    the researchers found, coal plant soot contributed to the
                    deaths of at least 460,000 Americans, including 25% of all
                    deaths among Medicare recipients before 2009.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Only Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio recorded more deaths
                    associated with coal plant pollution than the 25,000 deaths
                    in Illinois during the period studied.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An interactive map accompanying the study, published in the
                    journal Science, reveals glimmers of hope amid the grim
                    statistics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Deaths attributed to coal plant soot have declined
                    dramatically in recent years as utilities closed scores of
                    their dirtiest plants and cleaned up others—changes prompted
                    by more stringent federal clean air regulations, competition
                    from less expensive gas-fired power plants and legal
                    pressure from environmental groups.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The fact that they estimated more than 40,000 deaths a year
                    two decades ago and the number is now down to 1,600 a year
                    is a pretty remarkable success story," said Jonathan Levy,
                    chair of the Department of Environmental Health at Boston
                    University, who wasn't involved in the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Soot, also known as particulate matter, is a byproduct of
                    incomplete combustion and can be formed by chemical
                    reactions between sulfur dioxide emitted by fossil fuel
                    power plants and other compounds in the atmosphere. The type
                    of soot that most concerns public health
                    researchers—PM2.5—is so tiny that thousands of the fine
                    particles could fit on the period at the end of this
                    sentence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Breathing even small amounts can inflame the lungs and
                    trigger asthma attacks. Previous studies have linked soot
                    exposure with heart attacks and premature death.

                    Instead of a handy "alternate route," Google Maps was
                    leading her and her two passengers "far off the major
                    highway and into Nevada's fierce deserts on an off-roading
                    trail." Easler's car were not the only bushwackers. In

                    driver that turned around talked to us to tell us that the
                    road gets washed out the higher into the mountain you get,
                    and we have to turn around since the path leads nowhere. He
                    was in a huge truck and was just driving straight through
                    the bushes and shrubs to let people know to turn around,"
                    Easler said.

                  <p>
                    The off-roading trail was apparently only wide enough for
                    traffic in one direction, and attempting to return in that
                    other direction, "We were driving over bushes and rocks and
                    alot of the cars couldn't even make it," Easler says in the
                    second video. "Which is kind of why our car broke down."

                    They told SFGate that ultimately "We had to leave the car in
                    Vegas, and it got towed to the service center of a
                    dealership. They said the rear, right tire was coming off,
                    and the alignment was messed up too. Low-key a pretty
                    expensive fix."

                    They eventually called the highway patrol to shut down the
                    road that Google Maps was sending people to, because "With
                    every car coming in, every single car was getting trapped."

                    An estimated 50,000 shipwrecks can be found around the UK's
                    coastline and have been acting as a hidden refuge for fish,
                    corals and other marine species in areas still open to
                    destructive bottom towed fishing, a new study has shown.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of these wrecks have been lying on the seabed for well
                    over a century, and have served as a deterrent to fishers
                    who use bottom towed trawling to secure their catches.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result, while many areas of the seabed have been
                    damaged significantly in areas of heavy fishing pressure,
                    the seabed in and around shipwrecks remains largely
                    unblemished.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Jenny Hickman, the study's lead author, completed the
                    research as part of her MSc Marine Conservation program at
                    the University of Plymouth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She said, "The industrial use of bottom towed fishing gear
                    has been commonplace since the 1800s, and has significantly
                    altered marine communities and ecosystem services. Outside
                    of legal protection, only areas inaccessible to trawlers are
                    offered any protection, which is why shipwreck sites are
                    rarely subject to trawling pressure. As many have been in
                    situ for more than 100 years, they offer a baseline of
                    ecological potential when trawling pressure is reduced or
                    removed."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Joe Richards, Scotland Project Manager for Blue Marine
                    Foundation and one of the study's co-authors, said, "It has
                    long been thought that shipwrecks could be playing an
                    important role in providing sanctuary for marine species to
                    utilize. It is brilliant to see this proven in this study.
                    The research provides and insight into what might be
                    possible if bottom towed fishing activity is reduced. This
                    feeds into our wider understanding of shipwrecks' potential
                    to contribute to ecosystem recovery and enhancement, given
                    the sheer number found on the seabed."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Researchers say the latest study demonstrates the
                    importance of factoring wreck sites into future conservation
                    plans, but also the benefits of Marine Protected Areas
                    (MPAs) status.

                    Scott's ruling is considered a big blow to Tesla, which had
                    denied liability for Banner's death, arguing that human
                    error is at fault because "its manual and the 'clickwrap'
                    agreement sufficiently warned" Tesla owners of Autopilot's
                    limitations.

                    [...] Despite being called the "de facto leader" of the
                    Autopilot team in internal Tesla emails, Musk did not
                    provide a deposition in Banner's case, which was one of the
                    first times Tesla had to defend itself against claims that
                    Autopilot was fatally flawed,

                      >Reuters reported</a
                    >. In August, Tesla also seemingly attempted to do damage
                    control by seeking to "keep deposition transcripts of its
                    employees and other documents secret," Reuters noted.

                    [...] According to an expert in autonomous systems in
                    vehicles and driver monitoring systems who testified as one
                    of Banner's witnesses, Mary "Missy" Cummings, Tesla's
                    Autopilot is substandard in many ways. Cumming's opinion was
                    that Tesla overrepresented the Autopilot technology "as far
                    more capable than it actually was" and "used insufficient
                    avoidance detection technology." Cummings also suggested
                    that "the steering wheel torque driver inattention
                    attenuation technology was substandard to driver facing
                    cameras used by other auto manufacturers." In addition to
                    other flaws, these allegedly major defects, Cummings said,
                    "led to the foreseeability of the resulting crash in this
                    case," Scott wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scott based part of his opinion specifically on Cummings'
                    testimony and testimony from Adam Gustafsson, the systems
                    engineer who investigated both Banner's and Brown's Tesla
                    crashes, concluding that, "There is reasonable evidence from
                    which the finder of fact could conclude that Tesla through
                    its officers, employees and agents knew the vehicle at issue
                    had a defective Autopilot system and allowed the vehicle
                    with the system to be driven in areas not safe for that
                    technology."

                    reached the preliminary conclusion that the transaction may
                    significantly reduce competition in the global markets," the

                    [...] By erasing Figma as a competitive hurdle, Adobe would
                    also tighten its grip on the supply of vector and raster
                    editing tools, the EC added.

                  <p>
                    "Figma already exerts a significant constraining influence
                    on Adobe's vector editing tool, Adobe Illustrator, as well
                    as on Adobe's raster editing tool, Photoshop. Moreover,
                    absent the transaction, Figma is significantly likely to
                    enter these markets and grow into an effective competitive
                    force," it said.

                    [...] Adobe had wanted to get the deal done by the close of

                  <p>
                    In October, Adobe told us of the CMA investigation: "We
                    remain confident in the merits of the case as Figma's
                    product design is an adjacency to Adobe's core creative
                    products and Adobe has no meaningful plans to compete in the
                    product design space.”

                  <p>
                    [...] “The combination of Adobe and Figma will deliver
                    significant value to customers by making product design more
                    accessible and efficient, reimagining creative capabilities
                    on the web and creating new categories of creativity and
                    productivity.

                  <p>
                    "We remain confident in the merits of our case, as Figma’s

                    One summer morning, Le Thi Hong Mai's home collapsed into a
                    river in Vietnam's Mekong Delta, where shoreline erosion
                    caused by sand mining and hydropower dams threatens hundreds
                    of thousands of people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sand—needed to produce concrete—is the world's second most
                    exploited natural resource after water, and its use has
                    tripled in the last two decades, according to the UN
                    environment program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Vietnam's "rice bowl" delta region, where the Mekong empties
                    into the South China Sea, is predicted to run out of sand in
                    just over a decade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But losses to the riverbed are already devastating lives and
                    harming the local economy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Over the past two decades, hydropower dams upstream on
                    the Mekong have restricted the flow of sand to the delta.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And sand mining to feed Vietnam's construction boom is also
                    fast depleting resources, according to a major WWF report
                    published earlier this year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to Vietnam's ministry of transport, the
                    Delta region needs 54 million cubic meters of sand for six
                    major national highways before 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The river system can provide less than half, the ministry
                    says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Vietnam banned exports of sand in all forms in 2017.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But given high domestic demand, the amount dredged still
                    exceeds what comes downstream, Mekong expert Nguyen Huu
                    Thien explained.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the current extraction rate of 35-55 million cubic meters
                    a year, there will be no more sand by 2035, according to the
                    WWF-led study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These are the last grains of sand we are dredging," Thien
                    warned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Half the delta could be gone by the end of the
                    century, Thein warned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "After that, the delta will disappear altogether and we will
                    have to redraw our map and rewrite our geography books."

                    Because it's going to Mars, ESCAPADE has a relatively narrow
                    window to get off the ground next year. Documents on the
                    mission presented at public meetings earlier this year
                    indicated it had a launch window in August 2024, but Smith
                    said Monday that the mission is now set to fly "around this
                    time next year."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But there's not just the risk of a failed launch.
                    Given Blue Origin's history of delays, it's fair to question
                    whether New Glenn will really be ready to fly in a year's
                    time. The company's launch pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force
                    Station in Florida is complete, and production of rocket
                    parts is underway at Blue Origin factory a few miles away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Blue Origin hasn't rolled a full-scale New Glenn rocket
                    out to the launch pad for testing, including propellant
                    loading and countdown rehearsals. These first-time launch
                    pad tests have run for several months to more than a year
                    for other rockets, such as SpaceX's Starship, ULA's Vulcan,
                    or Europe's Ariane 6.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There's certainly some schedule risk associated with New
                    Glenn getting to the pad a year from now," Smith said.
                    "They're building hardware ... I've seen their schedule. I'm
                    not going to put a percentage out there."

                    filed by Moniruzzaman’s old employer, automotive technology
                    company Valeo, which is suing Nvidia — the company
                    Moniruzzaman moved on to — and accusing it of having
                    benefited from these stolen trade secrets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nvidia has spent the better part of a decade attempting to
                    branch out into the automotive market. Valeo is alleging
                    that Moniruzzaman “downloaded without authorization the
                    entirety of Valeo’s advanced parking and driving assistance
                    systems source code” in early 2021, along with “scores of
                    Valeo Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, PDF files,
                    and Excel spreadsheets explaining various aspects of the
                    technology” before leaving to join Nvidia in August that
                    year. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This alleged theft came to light in March the following
                    year, when employees from both Nvidia and Valeo were on a
                    call together working on a joint parking assistance project
                    for an unnamed automotive parts maker. Nvidia had won the
                    contract to develop software on the project, while Valeo was
                    providing ultrasonic sensor hardware. The lawsuit claims: 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “On March 8, 2022, one of these videoconference meetings was
                    scheduled. Mr. Moniruzzaman, now employed by Nvidia,
                    attended the videoconference call… and shared his computer
                    screen during the call. When he minimized the PowerPoint
                    presentation he had been sharing, however, he revealed one
                    of Valeo’s verbatim source code files open on his computer.
                    So brazen was Mr. Moniruzzaman’s theft, the file path on his
                    screen still read “ValeoDocs.” Valeo participants on the
                    videoconference call immediately recognized the source code
                    and took a screenshot before Mr. Moniruzzaman was alerted of
                    his error. By then it was too late to cover his tracks.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit goes on to state that German police “discovered
                    Valeo documentation and hardware pinned on the walls of Mr.
                    Moniruzzaman’s home office” when they raided his home as
                    part of a criminal investigation, and that Valeo’s software
                    and documents were found on his Nvidia computer when it was
                    seized by investigators. Moniruzzaman admitted to stealing
                    Valeo’s software when questioned by German police, according
                    to the lawsuit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As a result, Valeo is seeking damages and an
                    injunction to stop Nvidia and its employees from using or
                    sharing its trade secrets.

                    Given vast computing resources, the new model was able to
                    solve certain mathematical problems, the person said on
                    condition of anonymity because the individual was not
                    authorized to speak on behalf of the company. Though only
                    performing math on the level of grade-school students, acing
                    such tests made researchers very optimistic about Q*’s
                    future success, the source said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once math is conquered, AI will have greater reasoning
                    capabilities resembling human intelligence. After that, AI
                    could work on novel scientific research.

                    The letter flagged the potential danger of Q-Star, although
                    it’s unclear what the safety concerns are. Generally
                    speaking, researchers worry that the dawn of AI might also
                    lead to the demise of the human species.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As more intelligent AI comes along, it might decide that
                    destroying the human species might better serve its
                    interests. It sounds like the premise of
                    <em>Terminator</em> and <em>Matrix</em>, but it’s one fear
                    AI researchers have.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It’s unclear whether Q-Star is the key development that
                    could lead there. But we’ll only know after the fact.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers have also flagged work by an “AI scientist”
                    team, the existence of which multiple sources confirmed. The
                    group, formed by combining earlier “Code Gen” and “Math Gen”
                    teams, was exploring how to optimize existing AI models to
                    improve their reasoning and eventually perform scientific
                    work, one of the people said.

                  <p>
                    While OpenAI is yet to confirm this rumored innovation, Sam
                    Altman did tease a big breakthrough in the days preceding
                    his ouster.

                    NASA has celebrated a shipment of half a kilo of plutonium
                    oxide by the US Department of Energy, the largest since US
                    production of plutonium-238 was restarted just over a decade
                    ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Plutonium-238 (Pu-238) is essential for NASA missions using
                    Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS). RPS makes use of the
                    natural decay of Pu-238 to provide heat and electricity
                    through systems such as the Multi-Mission Radioisotope
                    Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG). As such, it's essential
                    for missions where solar power is not an option.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA's recent Mars rovers use the fuel, and Perseverance
                    uses an MMRTG to provide the robot with continuous heat and
                    approximately 110 watts of electricity. Other missions, such
                    as Cassini, also used the isotope, and Pu-238 power has kept
                    the Voyager probes running decades after the launch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, supplies have been limited. Pu-238 is a byproduct
                    of the process used to make nuclear weapons. As the need for
                    new nuclear weapons has ebbed over the years, stockpiles of
                    the fuel have dwindled. In 2015,
                    <a

                    >
                    estimated that approximately 35 kg remained available to
                    NASA, and of that, only 17 kg was good enough to use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hence the need to restart production. In 2010, the US
                    Department of Energy submitted a
                    <a

                    production rate of 1.5 kg per year by 2015. According to
                    NASA, that target won't be hit until at least 2026.

                    made more efficient use of Pu-238 – the Advanced Stirling

                    One chemical used in some anti-cancer drugs, for example,
                    costs pharmaceutical companies $3,200 per gram—50 times more
                    than a gram of gold. The UCLA researchers devised an
                    inexpensive way to produce this drug molecule from a
                    chemical costing just $3 per gram. They were also able to
                    apply the process to produce many other chemicals used in
                    medicine and agriculture for a fraction of the usual cost.

                    Industrial production of amines is therefore of great
                    interest, but the raw materials and reagents are often
                    expensive, and the processes can require many complicated
                    steps to complete. Using fewer steps and no expensive
                    ingredients, the process developed at UCLA can produce
                    valuable chemicals at a much lower cost than current
                    methods.

                    outer casing of zinc. Intensive research and development

                    which can store six times as much electrical energy in the
                    same volume. However, the energy density is still 40 times
                    worse than petrol. Experts suggest that the best we can hope
                    for is an improvement by a factor of two over the next 50
                    years.

                    None of these problems will be solved in the next few years,
                    and there is now evidence that many car manufacturers are
                    having second thoughts about involvement in the sector. The
                    most likely outcome is that BEVs will be a rerun of the
                    Concorde story, ending up as a short-lived plaything for the
                    wealthy few, and for a similar complex set of reasons."

                I think a mix of EV and ICE is best, both have strong and weak
                sides. It is stupid to develop a crash program for expensive
                technology as a solution to what many good scientists consider a
                non-problem.

                    Legacy AMD Radeon graphics cards, such as those based on the
                    company's original GCN architecture from early 2010s, can
                    run on practically all platforms under Linux, according

                    kernel-mode FPU support that were not supported on RISC-V —
                    which is why they could not work on RISC-V boards out of the
                    box, and required manual patching.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This issue is now being fixed thanks to new updates from
                    SiFive, and it looks promising for the upcoming Linux 6.8
                    kernel release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This series allows using newer AMD GPUs (e.g., Navi) on
                    RISC-V boards such as SiFive's HiFive Unmatched," a
                    statement by SiFive reads. "Those GPUs need
                    CONFIG_DRM_AMD_DC_FP to initialize, which requires
                    kernel-mode FPU support."

                  <p>
                    These changes are under review and are expected to be
                    included in the next Linux 6.8 kernel release, and will make
                    it easier to use the latest AMD Radeon graphics cards with
                    RISC-V and open-source drivers.

                    Abandoned animals, kids with cancer, disabled veterans:
                    These and other pitches for charity can move your emotions
                    and have you reaching for your credit card.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But beware: Especially around the holidays, fake charity
                    scammers are hard at work trying to part you from your
                    hard-earned cash.
                  </p>
                  <p>But scammers also know how to build trust, she warned.</p>
                  <p>
                    "They may call you using a local phone number," Parti said
                    in a Virginia Tech news release. "That tactic can give you a
                    false sense of security."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You then start listening to their pitch, expertly designed
                    to play on your emotions and often confusingly misleading.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It will be a good one. It will tug at your heartstrings,"
                    Parti said. "But listen closely because they will never
                    actually specify how they will help. They may even claim
                    that you've donated before and ask you to do it again."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Is this a real charity or a scammer? To quickly find out,
                    check databases like the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/search-for-tax-exempt-organizations"

                    at the Internal Revenue Service or watchdog groups such as
                    <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/">Charity Watch</a> to
                    see if the group being pitched is legit, Parti said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And pay very close attention to the <i>name</i> of the
                    charity: One common ruse is to give listeners a name that
                    very closely mimics that of a legitimate charity. If it's
                    just a shade different from the title of another well-known
                    charity (for example, American Society for Cancer, not
                    American Cancer Society), it could be a scam.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scammers will try and get all the personal info from you
                    they can: While a legit charity may simply want credit card
                    info for a donation, a scammer may go further and try and
                    get your Social Security number or bank account details.
                    Don't fall for it, Parti said.

                    Archaeologists from University College Dublin, working with
                    colleagues from Serbia and Slovenia, have uncovered a
                    previously unknown network of massive sites in the heart of
                    Europe that could explain the emergence of the continent's
                    Bronze Age megaforts—the largest prehistoric constructions
                    seen prior to the Iron Age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using satellite images and aerial photography to stitch
                    together the prehistoric landscape of the south Carpathian
                    Basin in Central Europe, the team discovered more than 100
                    sites belonging to a complex society.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their commonplace use of defensible enclosures was a
                    precursor and likely influence behind the famous hillforts
                    of Europe, built to protect communities later in the Bronze
                    Age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Some of the largest sites, we call these mega-forts, have
                    been known for a few years now, such as Gradište Iđoš,
                    Csanádpalota, Sântana or the mind-blowing Corneşti Iarcuri
                    enclosed by 33km of ditches and eclipsing in size the
                    contemporary citadels and fortifications of the Hittites,
                    Mycenaeans or Egyptians," said lead author Associate
                    Professor Barry Molloy, UCD School of Archaeology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What is new, however, is finding that these massive sites
                    did not stand alone, they were part of a dense network of
                    closely related and codependent communities. At their peak,
                    the people living within this lower Pannonian network of

                After 25 years of keeping the internet strong and stable, the

                    "It's super important to differentiate between what
                    countries decide to do with controlling content, as opposed
                    to the technical infrastructure," the Internet Corporation
                    for Assigned Names and Numbers' interim chief executive
                    Sally Costerton told AFP in a recent interview.

                    content -- have grown more insidious, interest has
                    heightened in giving governments more control of the
                    internet, including aspects that have previously been
                    covered by ICANN.
                  </p>

                    Shifting control of the internet's infrastructure to
                    governments and trade groups, and shutting out the technical
                    community, could crack its foundation, Costerton warned.

                    Nvidia has given the world a "SuperNIC" – another device to
                    improve network performance, just like the "SmartNIC," the
                    "data processing unit" (DPU), and the "infrastructure
                    processing unit" (IPU). But the GPU-maker insists its new
                    device is more than just a superlative.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So what exactly is a SuperNIC? An Nvidia
                    <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-supernic/"
                      >explainer</a

                    describes it as a "new class of networking accelerator
                    designed to supercharge AI workloads in Ethernet-based
                    networks." Key features include high-speed packet
                    reordering, advanced congestion control, programmable I/O
                    pathing, and, critically, integration with Nvidia's broader
                    hardware and software portfolio.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If that sounds like what a SmartNIC or DPU would do, you're
                    not wrong. The SuperNIC is even based on a current Nvidia
                    DPU, the BlueField-3.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nvidia's BlueField-3 SuperNIC promises Infiniband-ish
                    network performance – if you buy Nvidia's fancy 51.2Tbit/sec
                    switches – Click to enlarge. Source: Nvidia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The difference is the SuperNIC is designed to work alongside
                    Nvidia's own Spectrum-4 switches as part of its Spectrum-X
                    offering.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nvidia's senior veep for networking, Kevin Deierling,
                    emphasized in an interview with <em>The Register</em> that
                    the SuperNIC isn't a rebrand of the DPU, but rather a
                    different product.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before considering the SuperNIC, it's worth remembering that
                    SmartNICs/IPUs/DPUs are network interface controllers (NICs)
                    that include modest compute capabilities – sometimes
                    fixed-function ASICs, with or without a couple of Arm cores
                    sprinkled in, or even highly customizable FPGAs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of Intel and AMD's SmartNICs are based around FPGAs,
                    while Nvidia's BlueField-3 class of NICs pairs Arm cores
                    with a bunch of dedicated accelerator blocks for things like
                    storage, networking, and security offload.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This variety means that certain SmartNICs are better suited,
                    or at the very least marketed, towards certain applications
                    more than others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the most part, we've seen SmartNICs – or whatever your
                    preferred vendor wants to call them – deployed in one of two
                    scenarios. The first is in large cloud and hyperscale
                    datacenters where they're used to offload and accelerate
                    storage, networking, security, and even hypervisor
                    management from the host CPU.
                  </p>

                    A study published in Diversity provides new insight into how
                    toothed whales and dolphins came to navigate the underwater
                    world using sound waves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Whales and dolphins, which lack external ears, rely on a
                    technique called echolocation to navigate and hunt in the
                    dark. Much like shouting and listening for echoes, these
                    animals emit high-pitched sounds that bounce off objects and
                    reflect back at them, allowing them to map out their
                    surroundings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their skulls and soft tissues near and within the blowhole
                    are asymmetrical, meaning that a structure on one side is
                    larger or differently shaped than its counterpart on the
                    other side. This "lopsidedness" enables the production of
                    sound. At the same time, a fat-filled lower jawbone conducts
                    sound waves to the internal ear, allowing the animals to
                    locate where sounds are coming from (directional hearing).

                    The researchers analyzed a large collection of fossils that
                    included two ancient species of dolphins within the genus
                    Xenorophus, one of which is new to science. These species
                    are some of the primitive members of Odontoceti, the
                    suborder of marine mammals that includes all living
                    echolocating whales and dolphins.

                  unearthed in China, shows that neolithic people were capable
                  of complex engineering feats without the need for a

                    In a study published in <em>Nature Water</em>, the
                    archaeological team describe a network of ceramic water
                    pipes and drainage ditches at the Chinese walled site of
                    Pingliangtai dating back 4,000 years to a time known as the
                    Longshan period. The network shows cooperation amongst the
                    community to build and maintain the drainage system, though
                    no evidence of a centralised power or authority.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr Yijie Zhuang (UCL Institute of Archaeology), senior and
                    corresponding author on the paper, said: "The discovery of
                    this ceramic water pipe network is remarkable because the
                    people of Pingliangtai were able to build and maintain this
                    advanced water management system with stone age tools and
                    without the organisation of a central power structure. This
                    system would have required a significant level of
                    community-wide planning and coordination, and it was all
                    done communally."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ceramic water pipes make up a drainage system which is
                    the oldest complete system ever discovered in China. Made by
                    interconnecting individual segments, the water pipes run
                    along roads and walls to divert rainwater and show an
                    advanced level of central planning at the neolithic site.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What's surprising to researchers is that the settlement of
                    Pingliangtai shows little evidence of social hierarchy. Its
                    houses were uniformly small and show no signs of social
                    stratification or significant inequality amongst the
                    population. Excavations at the town's cemetery likewise
                    found no evidence of a social hierarchy in burials, a marked
                    difference from excavations at other nearby towns of the
                    same era.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The level of complexity associated with these pipes refutes
                    an earlier understanding in archaeological fields that holds
                    that only a centralised state power with governing elites
                    would be able to muster the organisation and resources to
                    build a complex water management system. While other ancient
                    societies with advanced water systems tended to have a
                    stronger, more centralised governance, or even despotism,
                    Pingliangtai demonstrates that was not always needed, and
                    more egalitarian and communal societies were capable of
                    these kinds of engineering feats as well.

                test. [When you] look at those up close... you see the same
                shock diamond effect on the smaller scale."

                "But what was interesting, specifically about this case [the
                second Starship launch], is you had 33 engines firing together,
                which you would kind of intuitively think would make for a
                pretty messy environment. I think close up [this] is probably
                true, there's some complicated dynamics happening there."

                    If there's one thing most office workers can agree on, it's
                    that they tend to feel less productive toward the end of the
                    day and the end of each work week. Now, a team of
                    researchers at Texas A&amp;M University has found objective
                    evidence of this phenomenon in action.

                    used a novel method of data collection to show that
                    employees really are less active and more prone to mistakes
                    on afternoons and Fridays, with Friday afternoon
                    representing the lowest point of worker productivity.

                    use employee self-reports, supervisory evaluations or
                    wearable technology, but these can be subjective and
                    invasive," said Benden, professor and head of the Department
                    of Environmental and Occupational Health. "Instead, we used
                    computer usage metrics — things like typing speed, typing
                    errors and mouse activity — to get objective, noninvasive
                    data on computer work patterns."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team then compared computer usage patterns across
                    different days of the week and times of the day to see what
                    kinds of patterns emerged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We found that computer use increased during the week, then
                    dropped significantly on Fridays," said Roh, assistant
                    professor in the Department of Epidemiology and
                    Biostatistics. "People typed more words and had more mouse
                    movement, mouse clicks and scrolls every day from Monday
                    through Thursday, then less of this activity on Friday."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition, Roh said, computer use decreased every
                    afternoon, and especially on Friday afternoons.

                    [...] What is the takeaway for employers? To start, flexible
                    work arrangements, such as hybrid work or a four-day work
                    week, may lead to happier and more productive employees.

                    The researchers—working in close collaboration with the
                    Royal Danish Navy—first identified World War II mines near a
                    busy shipping route off the coast of Denmark, choosing the
                    sites of two intact and two corroded devices. Divers from
                    the Navy collected ocean water and ocean floor sediment
                    around the mines, and researchers then used mass
                    spectrometry to measure the samples' levels of TNT. As the
                    researchers expected, chemical contamination was higher near
                    the corroded mines than the intact ones.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, using either a low-powered detonation or a
                    high-powered detonation, the team destroyed the leaking
                    mines and assessed the TNT released from the blasts.
                    Sediment contained up to 100 million times more TNT after
                    the weaker explosion and only 250 times more TNT after the
                    stronger blast. Similarly, the TNT levels in water after the
                    weaker blast far exceeded those around the stronger one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers say that the pollution released by the
                    low-power blast meets or exceeds levels previously reported
                    to be toxic to microalgae, sea urchins, and fish. Because of
                    the potential threats to nearby marine life, the researchers
                    encourage less invasive methods to remediate submerged World
                    War II relics—like robotic techniques to open and remove
                    abandoned mines' explosive contents—to prevent unwanted
                    explosions and contamination.

                    "If traumatic memories are not stored away properly, their
                    contents will come spilling out when the closet door opens,
                    often without warning. This is why ordinary events, such as
                    fireworks, can trigger flashbacks of traumatic experiences,
                    such as surviving a bombing or gunfire," he said. "We think
                    we can deploy positive emotions, possibly using music, to
                    help people with PTSD put that original memory in a box and

                    in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage
                    flight. It promised to tweak the system and engine

                    launch also failed, ending up in the Yellow Sea. That
                    failure was attributed to an "abnormal starting of the

                    understanding them can help mathematicians make major
                    discoveries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There's just one problem. Fano varieties are notoriously
                    difficult to categorize.

                  <p>
                    That's what scientists at the Imperial College of London
                    discovered when they set out to create a "periodic table of

                    elements on the periodic table, this geometric table aims to
                    group related Fano varieties together. [More (<i>sic</i>)]
                    easier said than done.

                    So, the Imperial team—which also includes scientists from

                    to help speed up the process. The results of this novel
                    method were published in the journal

                    "Fano varieties are basic building blocks in geometry—they
                    are 'atomic pieces' of mathematical shapes," the study
                    reads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Fano discovered the first of these "atomic" shapes
                    back in the 1930s. More have been discovered since, but so
                    far, they lack any organizing principle. Once categorized in

                    could be discovered (much like what the periodic table does

                    "Apart from run-of-the-mill jamming (e.g., with chirp
                    jammers), we have captured GPS spoofing signals in our radio
                    trawling," he said. "But, interestingly, the spoofing
                    signals never seemed to be complete. They were either
                    missing key internal data or were not mutually consistent,
                    and so would not have fooled a GPS receiver. They seemed to
                    be aimed at denial of service rather than actual deception.
                    My students and I came to realize that spoofing is the new
                    jamming. In other words, it is being used for denial of
                    service because it's more effective for that purpose than
                    blunt jamming."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Humphreys said the new attacks were highly significant as
                    unlike GPS jamming, spoofing, which he says acts like a
                    zero-day exploit against aviation systems, also corrupts the
                    IRS and backups, posing more of a threat to an aircraft's
                    safety.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    GPS spoofing has also been used by Israel to try and protect
                    itself from Hezbollah missile strikes, potentially
                    endangering commercial aircraft. Israel has warned pilots
                    landing in the country that they shouldn't rely on GPS to
                    land, instead relying on other methods.

                    Some online comments were visible when I looked the MT
                    story--first one was clearly from a car salesperson, along
                    the lines of, "So I'm going to be giving test rides and not
                    getting a commission?"

                    suspects that you will be paying a premium price, and not
                    getting the same deal that you could negotiate at the dealer
                    (end of quarter sales quotas, things like that).

                    is described as a version of the MQ1C Gray Eagle drone that
                    has been adapted for short take-off and landing (STOL) from
                    "austere" runways where it would otherwise not be possible
                    to operate large unmanned aircraft like the Predator.

                  <p>
                    This is how it is able to operate from the Royal Navy’s
                    Queen Elizabeth-class ships, which lack the catapults and
                    arresting gear that are normally used to launch and recover
                    fixed-wing planes from aircraft carriers. The F-35B fighters
                    that the UK's navy operates launch using a ramp at the bow
                    of the ship and typically perform a vertical landing, like
                    their Sea Harrier predecessors.

                    Mojave is 9 meters (29 ft) long and has a 16 meter (52 ft)
                    wingspan. It is claimed to be able to carry up to 1.633
                    metric tons (3,600 lb) in payload, the equivalent of 16
                    AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. Configured for a surveillance
                    mode, it is said to be capable of staying aloft for more
                    than 20 hours, which is one of the attractions of this type
                    of aircraft, as they don't need to carry any crew.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During the first trial take-off and landing, the Mojave
                    didn't carry anything, however, so further tests will be
                    required to see how easy it is to operate an aircraft like
                    this when carrying weapons or sensor payloads, and in
                    varying weather conditions. It also unclear how easy it will
                    be to land a drone safely on the Queen Elizabeth-class ships
                    when there are other aircraft such as F-35 fighters parked
                    on the deck.

                    The best heart rate for burning fat differs for each
                    individual and often does not align with the "fat burning
                    zone" on commercial exercise machines, Icahn School of
                    Medicine at Mount Sinai researchers report.

                    Instead, the researchers said, clinical exercise testing—a
                    diagnostic procedure to measure a person's physiological
                    response to exercise—may be a more useful tool to help
                    individuals achieve intended fat loss goals. The study,
                    which used a machine learning-based modeling approach, was
                    published online today in

                    "People with a goal of weight or fat loss may be interested
                    in exercising at the intensity which allows for the maximal
                    rate of fat burning. Most commercial exercise machines offer
                    a 'fat-burning zone' option, depending upon age, sex, and
                    heart rate," says lead author Hannah Kittrell, MS, RD, CDN,
                    a PhD candidate at Icahn Mount Sinai in the Augmented
                    Intelligence in Medicine and Science laboratory. "However,
                    the typically recommended fat-burning zone has not been
                    validated, thus individuals may be exercising at intensities
                    that are not aligned with their personalized weight loss
                    goals."

                    a balance between ensuring national security and

                    It would require warrants to collect Americans’ location
                    data and web browsing or search records under the program
                    and documentation that the queries were “reasonably likely

                    Senator Ron Wyden, who cosponsored the reform bill and sits
                    on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has said
                    <a
                      href="https://www.wired.com/story/section-702-surveillance-reauthorization-privacy-letter/"

                    >
                    the program unless some of its powers are curbed. “Congress
                    must have a real debate about reforming warrantless
                    government surveillance of Americans,” Wyden said in a
                    statement to MIT Technology Review. “Therefore, the
                    administration and congressional leaders should listen to
                    the overwhelming bipartisan coalition that supports adopting
                    common-sense protections for Americans’ privacy and
                    extending key national security authorities at the same
                    time.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The reform bill does not,

                      >as some civil society groups had hoped</a
                    >, limit the government’s powers for surveillance of people
                    outside of the US.

                  <p>
                    While it’s not yet clear whether these reforms will pass,
                    intelligence agencies have never faced such a broad,
                    bipartisan coalition of opponents. As for what happens next,
                    we’ll have to wait and see.

                characters made from said clay. Unfortunately the factory which
                made the special clay has gone under and although Aardman
                Studios bought out their stocks as they closed, the studio is
                now running terminally low on the clay:

                    This Plasticine-like substance is an animator's dream: it's
                    easy to mould, yet keeps its shape under hot studio lights.
                    But in March this year, the only factory that made it, on
                    the outskirts of Torquay, shut up shop. When its closure was
                    announced, Aardman bought up every last block of Lewis
                    Newplast that remained in the warehouse – enough for just
                    one more film: the new Wallace &amp; Gromit, coming in 2024.
                    After that, until a suitable replacement can be found, or
                    invented, that's it.

                I urge anyone with an active interest or comments to come
                forward and comment in the #meeting-discuss channel at any time,
                meeting or not, and to post forth any comments, questions,
                support, or participation interest there or in these journals
                and postings. Whatever your experience or insights - myself and
                I would imagine the entire staff and governance committee would

                The Board may determine to adopt a Conflict of Interest Policy
                governing situations where it faces a financial or other
                conflict or seeks to engage in an interested party transaction.
                For purposes of these by-laws, an "interested party transaction"
                is any contract or other transaction between the Corporation and
                (a) any present director or any individual who has served as a
                director in the five (5) years preceding the transaction ("past
                director"), (b) any family member of a present or past director,
                (c) any corporation, partnership, trust, or other entity in
                which a present or past director is a director, officer, or
                holder of a financial interest, (d) any present officer or any
                individual who has served as an officer in the five (5) years
                preceding the transaction ("past officer"), (e) any family
                member of a present or past officer, or (f) any corporation,
                partnership, trust, or other entity in which a present or past
                officer is a director, officer, or holder of a financial
                interest. If such a policy is adopted, in any instance where the
                Corporation proposes to enter into an interested party
                transaction, it shall follow the procedures and rules set forth
                in the Corporation's Conflict of Interest Policy.

                If the Board does not or has not yet developed a Conflict of
                Interest Policy, the Board may approve an interested party
                transaction with the consent or approval of a majority of the
                directors that are not involved in the interested party
                transaction on a determination that the transaction (a) is in
                the best interests of the Corporation, (b) is fair to the
                Corporation and reasonable in its terms, (c) is in alignment
                with or not opposed to the Corporation's mission and charitable
                objectives, and (d) does not create an appearance of impropriety
                that might impair Member or public confidence in, or the
                reputation of, the Corporation (even absent any actual conflict

                    has shared a video showing a five-second delay when loading
                    into a YouTube video on Mozilla Firefox. Upon manually
                    changing the user agent on the browser to Chrome, the
                    five-second delay no longer appears. The video has been
                    reproduced below:

                    Redditor vk6_ further notes that this isn’t a bug on
                    Firefox. The JavaScript code for the YouTube client on the
                    desktop reportedly contains code that adds the artificial
                    five-second delay. Others have chimed in, pointing out the
                    exact place to find this piece of code.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We can confirm that the above-mentioned snippet of code
                    exists. However, we cannot confirm if the code does indeed
                    add a five-second delay after checking for the user’s
                    browser of choice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can verify the existence of the code by inspecting this
                    <a
                      href="https://www.youtube.com/s/desktop/96766c85/jsbin/desktop_polymer_enable_wil_icons.vflset/desktop_polymer_enable_wil_icons.js"

                    >
                    and locating the following snippet of code with the find
                    function (press <strong>Ctrl</strong> and
                    <strong>F</strong> to open the finder):

                  <p>
                    For me, YouTube works equally well across Chrome, Firefox,
                    and Edge. Other team members also could not replicate this
                    delayed behavior across browsers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, multiple users have reported the same across
                    Firefox and Edge. The

                    to have experienced the delay without any extensions
                    enabled, indicating that the delay could be on a per-account
                    basis. The delay also does not trigger just once; it is
                    reportedly triggered every time YouTube links are opened in
                    a new tab.

                    >, its cross-platform Android replacement. Despite the
                    company claiming otherwise, the OS was based on Android and
                    supported Android apps. Four years later, Huawei appears
                    ready to ditch Android app support in its OS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    HarmonyOS phones sold in China have never shipped with
                    access to Google Play Services and the Play Store. But since
                    the underlying OS was based on Android, you could sideload
                    popular Android apps from third-party app stores with ease.
                    With HarmonyOS Next — the upcoming major release of Huawei's
                    operating system, the Chinese company will drop support for
                    all Android libraries. This effectively means it won't be
                    possible to sideload or install Android APKs on Huawei
                    phones running HarmonyOS Next.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While Huawei officially announced HarmonyOS Next
                    earlier this year, little is known about the changes it will
                    bring besides dropping Android app support. The OS itself
                    may continue to use AOSP as its base but skip including
                    support for Android app libraries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even then, the implications of this move on Huawei's phones
                    sold internationally are unclear. While such phones also
                    miss out on Play Store support, you could sideload popular
                    Android apps on them. Without the necessary app libraries,
                    though, this won't be possible. Given the company's
                    minuscule international market share, it's likely not too
                    worried about this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    HarmonyOS powers more than smartphones — it is also found on
                    Huawei's other devices, including tablets, smartwatches, and
                    IoT products. It is seemingly already running on over 700
                    million devices in China, with 2.2 million app developers
                    creating apps for the platform.

                    The new window on the universe opened by the RadioAstron
                    mission has revealed new details in the plasma jet of 3C
                    279, a blazar with a supermassive black hole at its core.
                    The jet has at least two twisted filaments of plasma
                    extending more than 570 light-years from the center.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is the first time we have seen such filaments so close
                    to the jet's origin, and they tell us more about how the
                    black hole shapes the plasma. The inner jet was also
                    observed by two other telescopes, the GMVA and the EHT, at
                    much shorter wavelengths (3.5 mm and 1.3 mm), but they were
                    unable to detect the filamentary shapes because they were
                    too faint and too large for this resolution," says Eduardo
                    Ros, a member of the research team and European scheduler of
                    the GMVA. "This shows how different telescopes can reveal
                    different features of the same object," he adds.

                    [...] The Earth-to-Space Interferometer RadioAstron mission,
                    active from July 2011 to May 2019, consisted of a 10-meter
                    orbiting radio telescope (Spektr-R) and a collection of
                    about two dozen of the world's largest ground-based radio
                    telescopes, including the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope.
                    When the signals of individual telescopes were combined
                    using the interference of radio waves, this array of
                    telescopes provided a maximum angular resolution equivalent
                    to a radio telescope of 350.000 km in diameter – almost the
                    distance between the Earth and Moon. This made RadioAstron
                    the highest angular resolution instrument in the history of
                    astronomy.

                    If you've ever had dialup internet service, or still do, or
                    just know someone that does, you have probably heard terms
                    like "56k modem". "56k" has become almost synonymous with
                    dialup Internet access. But it's such an arbitrary number.
                    It's not divisible by ten, it's not a power of two... so why
                    was it chosen as the fastest dialup speed? For the answer,
                    we will have to travel back in time quite a while.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our visitors from Google should be warned that this is not a
                    "stripped down" explanation; it is intended for relatively
                    technical readers. But if you really want to know where this
                    magic number comes from, you need to understand some of the
                    technical background. As we shall see, "56k" was not just
                    pulled out of a hat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Anyone that has ever used a dialup modem knows full
                    well that they don't actually get to connect at that speed,
                    though. And that their connection speed varies each time
                    they dial in. There are two factors at work here.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first is the FCC. If you are in the United States, the
                    FCC places a restriction on the power output of devices
                    connected to the phone network. The result is that you will
                    never be able to connect at a speed faster than 53.3 kbit/s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second is the overall complexity of the phone network.
                    56 kbit/s (or 53.3 kbit/s) requires very good operating
                    conditions, as it is really operating beyond the paramaters
                    of what the phone network is required to be capable of.
                    Operating at these speeds requires that there only be one
                    ADC between the user and their ISP (which is not guaranteed
                    to be true, but typically is), and that the copper wiring in
                    the user's "local loop" have very good electrical
                    properties. Part of the dialup process that is used to
                    initiate a connection is an evaluation of the overall
                    quality of the connection; if it is determined to be
                    lacking, the modem will automatically drop down to a lower
                    data rate.

                    Such warning or limits would mark the first time that
                    Americans would be advised to consider not just the basic
                    nutritional components of foods, but also how their foods
                    are processed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Deirdre K. Tobias, a member of the guidelines advisory
                    committee, told the Post that the study suggested
                    ultra-processed foods seem to promote higher "passive
                    intake" of calories beyond what our bodies need and that the
                    numerous epidemiological studies suggesting a link between
                    eating ultra-processed foods and having a higher risk of
                    many diseases is "as compelling as it can be." She declined
                    to comment directly on the upcoming guidelines, noting that
                    the committee's work is underway.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Post also notes that the food industry has strongly
                    pushed back—writing directly to the committee telling them
                    not to issue any warnings or limits. One key point of
                    contention is that there is no exact or established
                    definition of what counts as "ultra-processed." Generally,
                    it is considered to include any industrially produced food
                    product with artificial combinations of flavors and
                    additives, such as artificial sweeteners, emulsifiers, and
                    synthetic colors. Products that easily fit the definition
                    include things like chips, frozen dinners, boxed sweetened
                    cereals, chicken nuggets, and boxed macaroni and cheese.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Much to the dismay of nutrition experts, the National School
                    Lunch Program allows its 30 million participating schools to
                    serve products clearly in the ultra-processed food category,
                    including Domino's pizza, Lunchables, and Cheez-Its.
                    Currently, the products must only meet the federal dietary
                    guidance's standards for things like sodium, fat, protein,
                    and whole grains—regardless of how many other additives they
                    include.

                    Earlier today, the threat actor listed the software company
                    MeridianLink on their data leak with a threat that they
                    would leak allegedly stolen data unless a ransom is paid in
                    24 hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    MeridianLink is a publicly traded company that provides
                    digital solutions for financial organizations such as banks,
                    credit unions, and mortgage lenders.

                    According to

                      >DataBreaches.net</a
                    >, the ALPHV ransomware gang said they breached
                    MeridianLink's network on November 7 and stole company data
                    without encrypting systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ransomware actor said that "it appears MeridianLink
                    reached out, but we are yet to receive a message on their
                    end" to negotiate a payment in exchange for not leaking the
                    supposedly stolen data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The alleged lack of response from the company likely
                    prompted the hackers to exert more pressure by sending a
                    complaint to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
                    (SEC) about MeridianLink not disclosing a cybersecurity
                    incident that impacted "customer data and operational
                    information."

                  <p>
                    [...] In their own words, the attacker told the SEC that
                    MeridianLink suffered a "significant breach" and did not
                    disclose it as required in Form 8-K, under Item 1.05.

                The Intel 4004 was released on Nov 15 <b>52 years ago</b>, and
                it was an incredibly important chip with an interesting history.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    On Nov. 15, 1971, the Intel 4004 CPU was released. It was
                    the first commercially produced microprocessor and the
                    first-ever CPU for Intel, which later went on to become a
                    domineering force in the PC industry. It all started thanks
                    to Nippon Calculating Machine Corp. asking Intel to produce
                    12 custom chips for the Busicom 141-PF printing calculator.
                    Intel's engineers went on to recommend a family of just four
                    chips instead, but one that could be used for a variety of
                    products. These four chips were known as the MCS-4 (Micro
                    Computer System, 4-bit), laying the groundwork for Intel to
                    succeed as one of the most influential companies in modern
                    electronics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the Intel 4000 family, these were split up as
                    follows:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Intel 4001: A 256-byte 4-bit ROM.</li>
                    <li>
                      Intel 4002: DRAM with four 20-nibble registers. A nibble
                      is four consecutive binary digits, otherwise known as half
                      an 8-bit byte.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Intel 4003: I/O with a 10-bit static shift register with
                      serial and parallel outputs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Intel 4004: A CPU.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    This system, when fully expanded, could interface with 16
                    4001 chips for a total of 4KB ROM, 16 4002 chips for 640
                    bytes of RAM, and any number of Intel 4003 chips. With these
                    designs complete, Busicom went on to prototype the
                    calculator that would use them. In April 1971, they could
                    confirm that the calculator worked, packing one 4004, two
                    4002, three 4003, and four 4001 chips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] At the time, the Intel 4004 really was as influential
                    as the company made it out to be. It had 2,300 transistors,
                    whereas nowadays, the Apple Silicon M3 Max has 97 billion.
                    It was a massively important chip that changed the course of
                    the computing industry forever, as it was a building block
                    that engineers could purchase to customize with software. It
                    was used in ATMs, pinball machines, and more.

                    As per information from chi11eddog, a reliable source for
                    hardware leaks regarding CPU and motherboard launches, AMD
                    is reportedly in the process of developing at least two
                    additional CPUs in the Ryzen 5000X3D series. One of these is
                    a more affordable 8-core model known as the Ryzen 7 5700X3D,
                    anticipated to boast a base clock of 3.0 GHz and a boost
                    clock of 4.1 GHz. This particular CPU is expected to have
                    clock speeds that are 400 MHz lower than the 5800X3D SKU.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The current report does not offer details on the
                    potential availability of the newly discussed CPUs. Right
                    now, AMD has two new CPUs with 3D V-Cache. One is called the
                    5800X3D and is considered the best gaming CPU for the AM4
                    platform. The other is called the 5600X3D and can only be
                    bought from MicroCenter in the United States. The prospect
                    of AMD broadening the availability of 3D V-Cache options
                    globally, rather than confining them to specific retailers,
                    would indeed be noteworthy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The introduction of the 5700X3D and 5500X3D models for the
                    AM4 platform could make it better for gamers who don't want
                    to spend too much money. The release of more cost-effective
                    SKUs could offer gamers an attractive upgrade path without
                    imposing a substantial financial burden, paving the way for
                    a transition to newer AM5/LGA-1851 sockets in the future.

                  <p>
                    A noteworthy aspect of the X3D series is its compatibility
                    with various entry-level motherboards. These CPUs do not
                    support overclocking. Hence, their requirements are lower.
                    Despite this limitation, these CPUs show superior
                    performance in gaming tests compared to their non-X3D
                    counterparts.

                    Various forms of heat pumps—refrigerators, air conditioners,
                    heaters—are estimated to consume about 30 percent of the
                    world's electricity. And that number is almost certain to
                    rise, as heat pumps play a very large role in efforts to
                    electrify heating to reduce the use of fossil fuels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most existing versions of these systems rely on the
                    compression of a class of chemicals called
                    hydrofluorocarbons, gasses that were chosen because they
                    have a far smaller impact on the ozone layer than earlier
                    refrigerants. Unfortunately, they are also extremely potent
                    greenhouse gasses, with a short-term impact several thousand
                    times that of carbon dioxide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Alternate technologies have been tested, but all of them
                    have at least one major drawback in comparison to gas
                    compression. In a paper released in today's issue of
                    Science, however, researchers describe progress on a form of
                    heat pump that is built around a capacitor that changes
                    temperature as it's charged and discharged. Because the
                    energy spent while charging it can be used on discharge, the
                    system has the potential to be highly efficient.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For hydrofluorocarbons, the difference in heat content
                    can be controlled by altering the pressure. Compressing a
                    gas will heat it up while lowering the pressure cools it
                    down. However, various other materials undergo similar
                    heating and cooling in response to other external
                    influences, including physical stress, magnetic fields, or
                    electric fields. In many cases, these materials remain solid
                    despite experiencing significant changes in temperature,
                    which could potentially simplify the supporting equipment
                    needed for heating and cooling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the new work, done by researchers mostly based in
                    Luxembourg, the researchers focused on materials that change
                    temperature in response to electric fields, generically
                    known as electrocalorics. While a variety of configurations
                    have been tested for these materials, researchers have
                    settled on a layered capacitor structure, with the electric
                    field of the material changing as more charge is stored
                    within it. As charge is stored, an electrocaloric material
                    will heat up. When the charge is drained, they'll draw in
                    heat from the environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This has a significant advantage regarding the power needed
                    for the device to operate since the current generated when
                    draining the capacitor can just be used to power something.
                    There's a little energy lost during the round-trip in and
                    out of storage, but that can potentially be limited to less
                    than one percent.
