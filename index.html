                  <p>
                    Recently, my father and I took a trip out to a local
                    provincial park for a weekend of camping.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last time I had been camping happened to coincide with the
                    period of time that I was starting to gain curiosity about
                    amateur radio. I vividly recall being out there wishing I
                    had a radio that I could use to communicate from the
                    campsite.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, to appease my past self, the present-tense
                    radio-license-having version of me took my HF rig along to
                    make some contacts.

                    Justice Michael Lee handed down his judgement in the class
                    action against widely-used herbicide Roundup on Thursday
                    afternoon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The case, launched by Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, claims
                    Roundup's active ingredient glyphosate caused the cancer of
                    more than 800 Australian non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Justice Lee ruled there is not enough current evidence to
                    say glyphosate is carcinogenic and capable of causing
                    non-Hodgkin lymphoma in humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The judge only needed to consider the question of general
                    causation – not the specific claims of lead applicant Kelvin
                    McNickle or the other class action group members.
                  </p>
                  <p>Justice Lee ordered the proceedings be dismissed.</p>
                  <p>
                    Bayer, which acquired Roundup's producer Monsanto in 2018,
                    has previously stated glyphosate-based herbicides have been
                    rigorously tested in hundreds of studies and it is safe when
                    used as directed.

                    In addition, comparisons of the planet’s temperature map
                    with complex 3D atmospheric models demonstrated that this
                    temperature contrast is stronger than expected for a
                    cloud-free atmosphere. This suggests that the planet’s
                    nightside is shrouded in a thick layer of clouds that blocks
                    much of the infrared radiation that would otherwise be
                    observed. Unlike Earth’s water clouds, the clouds on this
                    extremely hot planet resemble dust and are composed of rocks
                    and minerals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Surprisingly, despite this thick layer of clouds, the
                    JTEC-ERS team also detected clear signals of water on the
                    planet’s nightside. This allowed them to determine, for the
                    first time, the cloud height and thickness, unveiling their
                    unusual altitude and density compared to Earth’s clouds. The
                    researchers also detected wind-driven mixing, called
                    “chemical disequilibrium,” that swiftly transports gas
                    throughout the planet’s atmosphere and results in uniform
                    atmospheric chemistry.

                    the engines were up and running and operating at 100 percent
                    power.

                    A former Shuttle flight director, Wayne Hale,
                    <a
                      href="https://waynehale.wordpress.com/2014/10/26/sts-93-we-dont-need-any-more-of-those/"

                    the subsequent events: "Exactly when it happened is not
                    clear, but on the right engine, the gold-plated pin from LOX
                    post 32 in row 13 came shooting out. Just like a bullet, it
                    went through the narrow part of the converging nozzle and
                    flew out into the nozzle extension."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This could have been disastrous – the LOX post had been
                    pinned for a reason and could have failed and let LOX flow
                    into the engine, resulting in explosion. "Failure of the LOX
                    post was considered a CRIT 1 failure – loss of vehicle and
                    crew 'promptly,'" Hale wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Or the nozzle extension could have failed. Another CRIT 1
                    failure. According to Hale, it had been calculated that if
                    five adjacent cooling tubes in the nozzle extension were
                    split, there would not be enough cooling and a burn through
                    would occur. As it was, only three tubes were breached as
                    the bullet-shaped LOX pin hit the side of the right nozzle
                    extension.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The immediate effect was a hydrogen leak from the nozzle. It
                    was not huge, but enough for the engine's controller to
                    increase the oxidizer flow, increasing the turbine
                    temperature approximately halfway to the point where an
                    engine would be automatically shut down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It took the booster officer and his team around a minute to
                    realize something was amiss with the engine – not for want
                    of attention but because they had their hands full with
                    another problem. Remember that loose SRB connection? It
                    resulted in an alarm on the console. There were two
                    hydraulic systems on each SRB. If both failed, the SRB would
                    not be steerable. Another sudden CRIT 1 failure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And then there was that chafed wire and the potential short
                    circuit. As the Shuttle lifted off, the commander, Eileen
                    Collins, called "Fuel Cell PH."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hale wrote that the call indicated that one of the fuel
                    cells might be failing: "It's the Kaboom Case, Flight."
                    However, although the master alarm onboard Columbia was
                    wailing, the fuel cell had not actually failed. Instead, one
                    of the AC buses had shorted out. The affected part of the
                    circuit had been automatically shut down, and the erroneous
                    alarm was caused by suddenly unpowered instrumentation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One effect of the short was a loss of power to the Space
                    Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) controllers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Hale: "The A computer on the Center SSME lost
                    power, never to be recovered. The B computer (DCU B)
                    immediately took control and the engine ran on normally."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Except it wasn't running normally. The A channel pressure
                    transducer dropped offline, meaning that the B computer only
                    had the B transducer, which was reading slightly high – in
                    this case, 12 psi high. Automatically, the B computer
                    throttled back the center engine. Not hugely, but enough to
                    partially offset the shortfall of LOX caused by the nozzle
                    leak on the right engine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The engine had lost its B computer, but the A computer
                    continued working, and the engine, with the leak, carried on
                    running.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "How lucky we were," Hale said. "Instead of being 200 or
                    more fps short at MECO, possibly leading to an abort landing
                    or requiring two tons of OMS propellant to make up, we wound
                    up being only 15 fps short, well within the capability of
                    the OMS budget."
                  </p>

                    The mission itself was successful, and the Chandra X-ray
                    observatory, which is

                    that the wiring problem was likely caused by workers
                    "inadvertently stepping on it," and the problem had likely
                    been there since Columbia was manufactured. And the pin?
                    Apparently, it had never passed any acceptance testing.
                    STS-93 was the last flight of that generation of SSMEs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The next upgrade to the SSMEs was to build a more robust
                    channel wall nozzle extension," Hale said. "The shuttle
                    program ended before that was done."

                    While Shannon's "yikes" will go down in spaceflight history,

                    Summing ASCII Encoded Integers on Haswell at the Speed of
                    memcpy turned out more popular than I expected, which
                    inspired me to take on another challenge on HighLoad:
                    Counting uint8s. I'm currently only #13 on the leaderboard,
                    ~7% behind #1, but I already learned some interesting
                    things. In this post I'll describe my complete solution
                    (skip to that) including a surprising memory read pattern
                    that achieves up to ~30% higher transfer rates on fully
                    memory bound, single core workloads compared to naive
                    sequential access, while apparently not being widely known

                    The automaker announced the pivot in an earnings call this
                    week, with CEO Mary Barra citing the Origin's "unique
                    design" as creating too much "regulatory uncertainty." That
                    design was indeed unusual, with no immediately obvious front
                    or rear, and not a single spot for a human driver.

                    Instead of the Origin, GM's Cruise autonomous driving
                    division will refocus on modifying existing Chevy Bolt EVs
                    for self-driving capabilities. A new generation of
                    autonomous Bolts is slated for production in 2025, and Barra
                    says going this route will reduce costs per vehicle.

                    GM's chief financial officer Paul Jacobson says the company
                    "might" revisit Origin down the road, but currently the
                    efforts are "really going to be focused" on the Bolt.

                    CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm that crashed millions of
                    computers with a botched update all over the world last
                    week, is offering its partners a $10 Uber Eats gift card as
                    an apology, according to several people who say they
                    received the gift card, as well as a source who also
                    received one.

                    On Tuesday, a source told TechCrunch that they received an

                    the company recognizes "the additional work that the July 19

                    A team of marine biologists and ecotoxicologists affiliated
                    with several institutions in Brazil has found cocaine in
                    muscle and liver samples collected from Brazilian Sharpnose
                    sharks harvested off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. Their
                    study,
                    <a
                      href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969724049477"
                      >published</a
                    >
                    in the journal <i>Science of the Total Environment</i>,
                    highlights the potential impact of the presence of illicit
                    drugs in marine environments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prior research has suggested that much cocaine winds up in
                    the ocean via wastewater from sewage systems, drainage from
                    labs and packages abandoned by traffickers attempting to
                    prevent discovery. What is not known is how long the drug
                    persists in the sea and what impact it has on ocean life.
                    For this new study, the research team tested Brazilian
                    Sharpnose sharks, a small variety that makes its home in the
                    shallow waters along many of Brazil's coastal areas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers purchased 13 of the sharks from local
                    fishermen. Each was dissected in the lab, where the team
                    also collected muscle and liver samples and assessed them
                    with tandem mass spectrometry. They found cocaine in all the
                    samples at concentrations approximately 100 times higher
                    than observed in any other marine animal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers suggest their findings are just a starting
                    point regarding research into the presence of cocaine in the
                    sea. They note that it is not known what sort of impact the
                    cocaine might have on the sharks. They do not know, for
                    example, if it impacts their behavior, as it does humans, or
                    if it impacts other functions such as their reproductive
                    abilities.

                    A separate "front line" in this confrontation is the
                    development and implementation of SoM [System on Module]
                    with Programmable Logic. This post is dedicated to one small
                    "battle," on the example of which we want to show why, in
                    our opinion, China could win this "war."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since the announcement in 2019 by Xilinx (which then bore
                    this name without a proud three-letter prefix), Versal ACAP
                    (Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform) chips were
                    inaccessible to developers—the first development boards cost
                    tens of thousands of U.S. dollars, and the difficulty of
                    developing your own board for this chip would scare off
                    anyone other than Tony Stark.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A lot of water flowed, and a lot of developers' tears were
                    shed, but a silicon Versal is just as unavailable as The
                    Palace of Versailles: the cheapest kit from AMD–VEK280 is
                    sold by the official suppliers for $7K, excluding delivery
                    and customs clearance. The classic argument in the style of
                    "if you don't have money for an iron door, you don't need
                    it" does not always work in the field of R&amp;D—a rare
                    developer will refuse to study a top-end chip at the expense
                    of his employer, but even with this approach, the cost is
                    too high.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The problem is that the announcement of AMD Xilinx has
                    so far remained an announcement, but the developers from
                    Alinx, the Chinese company, did not waste any time. This
                    company already is known for its inexpensive development
                    boards with Zynq‑7000 and Ultrascale+ on board, not much
                    different from SoM. Now they not only promised, but also
                    mass-produced the SoM V100 with the XCVE2302-SFVA784-1LP-E-S
                    chip (Versal AI Edge family) for $750 [1].
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There is, of course, a fly in the V100 ointment. The
                    developers from Alinx were so inspired by Kria that they
                    also used "legendary" Samtec connectors "well-liked" by all
                    designers and engineers. Who among us hasn't drilled them
                    from the side with the thinnest drill, forgetting to route
                    that very necessary pin right in the middle in the inner
                    row? However, to achieve the required transmission speeds
                    with a compact size, there is hardly an alternative to
                    Samtec connectors.

                    A Chinese lunar probe found traces of water in samples of
                    the moon's soil, scientists have said, as the country pushes
                    its ambitious space program into high gear.

                    The Chang'e-5 rover completed its mission in 2020, returning
                    to Earth with rock and soil samples from the moon.

                    The lunar samples "revealed the presence of trace water",
                    the group of scientists from Chinese universities
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02306-8"

                  <p>
                    A NASA infrared detector already confirmed in 2020 the
                    existence of water on the moon, while scientists found
                    traces of water in recent analyses of samples dating from
                    the 1960s and 1970s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the Chang'e-5 samples are from a "much higher latitude",
                    providing new clues as to what form water takes on the
                    moon's surface, the Chinese scientists wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The samples suggest that "water molecules can persist in
                    sunlit areas of the moon in the form of hydrated salts",
                    they said.

                    Recently one of my older post about strlcpy has sparked some
                    discussion on various forums. Presumably the recently
                    released POSIX edition had something to do with it. One
                    particular counter-argument was raised by multiple posters -
                    and it's an argument that I've heard before as well:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        In the common case where the source string fits in to
                        the destination buffer, strlcpy would only traverse the
                        string once whereas strlen + memcpy would traverse it
                        twice always.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Hidden in this argument is the assumption that traversing
                    the string once is faster. Which - to be clear - is not at
                    all an unreasonable assumption. But is it actually true?
                    That's the focus of today's article.

                    When it comes to discoveries about our upper atmosphere, it
                    pays to know your surroundings.

                    Using data from the Twin Rockets to Investigate Cusp
                    Electrodynamics (TRICE-2) rocket launch, NASA scientists
                    Francesca Di Mare and Gregory Howes from the University of
                    Iowa studied waves traveling down Earth's magnetic field
                    lines into the polar atmosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These waves were known to accelerate electrons, which pick
                    up speed as they "surf" along the electric field of the
                    wave. But their effect on ions—a more heterogenous group of
                    positively charged particles, which exist alongside
                    electrons—was unknown.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By estimating the ion mixture they were flying
                    through—predominantly protons and singly charged oxygen
                    ions—the scientists discovered that these waves were
                    accelerating protons as they circle about the Earth's
                    magnetic field lines as well as electrons as they surf the
                    waves. The

                    This correspondence between human and chimpanzee
                    face-to-face communication points to shared underlying rules
                    in communication, the researchers say. They note that these
                    structures could trace back to shared ancestral mechanisms.
                    It's also possible that chimpanzees and humans arrived at
                    similar strategies to enhance coordinated interactions and
                    manage competition for communicative "space." The findings
                    suggest that human communication may not be as unique as one
                    might think.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It shows that other social species don't need language to
                    engage in close-range communicative exchanges with quick
                    response time," Badihi says. "Human conversations may share
                    similar evolutionary history or trajectories to the
                    communication systems of other species suggesting that this
                    type of communication is not unique to humans but more
                    widespread in social animals."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We still don't know when these conversational
                    structures evolved, or why!" Hobaiter says. "To get at that
                    question we need to explore communication in more distantly
                    related species -- so that we can work out if these are an
                    ape-characteristic, or ones that we share with other highly
                    social species, such as elephants or ravens."

                    Because MySQL is so popular, there are plenty of videos and
                    tutorials available to learn how to set up the database and
                    use its SQL syntax to create queries. MySQL is also suitable
                    for personal projects and is free for individual use. It
                    runs on both Windows and Linux, making it accessible to
                    almost any developer. Many developers begin learning
                    database programming and storage design with MySQL.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    MariaDB is slightly more challenging because it's designed
                    as an enterprise solution. It has more engines to work with
                    and is available in the cloud. Most enterprise applications
                    have many more features than consumer alternatives, making
                    them more difficult to learn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No one can predict the future, but MySQL is likely here to
                    stay. More application developers might choose MariaDB over
                    MySQL for enterprise applications, but MySQL still maintains
                    a strong market presence. WordPress works natively with
                    MySQL and powers a significant percentage of websites –
                    however, WordPress is also compatible with MariaDB – MariaDB
                    can be used seamlessly with WordPress without requiring
                    significant changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the future, MariaDB could power a large portion of web
                    applications, but for now, it maintains a strong presence in
                    the enterprise realm, especially in Linux environments. It's
                    possible that MariaDB will become a more popular database
                    for enterprise applications in a LAMP environment.
                  </p>

                    If you need to learn about databases or have a small pet
                    project, MySQL may be the best option. MySQL offers a
                    convenient desktop application that simplifies database
                    management and configuration. The
                    <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/"
                      >MySQL Workbench</a
                    >
                    software uses a graphical user interface to guide you
                    through the table creation process, and you can build your
                    queries and functions with better feedback from the database
                    service if you make mistakes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a large organization, MariaDB is the better option. It's
                    also beneficial for smaller businesses that expect a large
                    increase in concurrent users (there are some
                    <a
                      href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/graphical-and-enhanced-clients/"
                      >GUI applications here</a
                    >, too, if you need them). MariaDB scales easily as an
                    application becomes more popular and more users access it.
                    If you want to get experience working with cloud databases,
                    MariaDB is a good choice for learning replication and
                    management of data in the cloud.

                  <p>
                    As a fork of MySQL, MariaDB shares many similarities with
                    its predecessor, making the determination of "which is
                    better" subjective. Some developers prefer MariaDB because
                    it's open-source and free, but MySQL is a stable, popular
                    alternative that's good for small projects.

                    (DHS) has announced that it has developed a four-legged
                    robot designed to jam the wireless transmissions of smart
                    home devices. The robot was revealed at the 2024 Border
                    Security Expo and is called NEO. It is built using the
                    Quadruped Unmanned Ground Vehicle (Q-UGV) and looks a lot
                    like the Boston Dynamics Spot robot. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the transcript of the speech by DHS Federal Law
                    Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) director Benjamine
                    Huffman, acquired by
                    <a
                      href="https://www.404media.co/dhs-has-a-ddos-robot-to-disable-internet-of-things-booby-traps-inside-homes/"
                      >404 Media</a
                    >, NEO is equipped with an antenna array that is designed to
                    overload home networks, thus disrupting devices that rely on
                    Wi-Fi and other wireless communication protocols. It will
                    thus likely be effective against a wide range of popular
                    smart home devices that use wireless technologies for
                    communications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Aside from taking out smart devices, law enforcement can
                    also use the robot to communicate with subjects in the
                    target area, and to provide remote eyes and ears to officers
                    on the ground. “NEO can enter a potentially dangerous
                    environment to provide video and
                    <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/audio">audio</a>
                    feedback to the officers before entry and allow them to
                    communicate with those in that environment,” says Huffman.
                    “NEO carries an onboard computer and antenna array that will
                    allow officers the ability to create a ‘denial-of-service’
                    (DoS) event to disable ‘Internet of Things’ devices that
                    could potentially cause harm while entry is made.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This roaming robotic jammer was first contemplated after a
                    child sexual abuse suspect used his doorbell camera to see
                    FBI agents at his door serving a search warrant. The gunman
                    opened fire on them from behind the closed door with an
                    assault-style rifle, killing two veteran agents and injuring
                    three more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Aside from the NEO, the DHS also built the ‘FLETC Smart
                    House’, which is designed to train law enforcement about
                    smart home devices and how they could be used against them.
                    Huffman explained, “A suspect who has been searched and is
                    under the control of officers can cause these actions to
                    happen with a simple voice command which can start a chain
                    of events to occur within a house, such as turning off
                    lights, locking doors, activating the HVAC system to
                    introduce chemicals into the environment and cause a fire or
                    explosion to take place.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This development shows how law enforcement is catching up
                    with technological advancements. Smart home devices started
                    becoming common in the mid-to-late-2010s, with many users
                    installing them to automate several aspects of their houses
                    and bolster security. So, anyone with a little bit of
                    technical know-how and ingenuity could potentially create a
                    hostile environment using readily available wireless
                    electronics. While NEO might not be able to affect
                    hard-wired smart devices, it would still be able to disable
                    the radio frequencies most wireless IoT devices use, thus
                    reducing the risks for law enforcement officers.

                    Their research focuses on the science of ultrasound
                    cross-device tracking (uXDT), a new technology that started
                    being deployed in modern-day advertising platforms around
                    2014.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    uXDT relies on advertisers hiding ultrasounds in their ads.
                    When the ad plays on a TV or radio, or some ad code runs on
                    a mobile or computer, it emits ultrasounds that get picked
                    up by the microphone of nearby laptops, desktops, tablets or
                    smartphones.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These second-stage devices, who silently listen in the
                    background, will interpret these ultrasounds, which contain
                    hidden instructions, telling them to ping back to the
                    advertiser's server with details about that device.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Advertisers use uXDT in order to link different devices to
                    the same person and create better advertising profiles so to
                    deliver better-targeted ads in the future.

                Fermilab is a major US national lab with a budget of several
                100M$ per year, focusing on particle physics. All is not well at
                the lab, however, following project delays and huge cost
                overruns for the flagship DUNE project. The organisation that
                operates Fermilab, led by University of Chicago, has

                and the lab director Lia Merminga has been laid off. Now a pair
                of senior and well-respected scientists have put their oar in as
                well, blasting the management of the lab over the past decade
                that has led to the current situation in a paper posted to the
                arxiv preprint server. The pair point at many problems, based on
                a toxic working environment, giving anecdotal examples supported
                by indicators such as a fourfold increase in sick leave over the
                past decade.

                    [...] Using AI, companies can now answer questions like,
                    "What is this person going to buy next? What do we think
                    they're going to be willing to pay? Where are they going to
                    buy from? When are they going to buy it?" said Jain.

                    Matt Pavich, senior director of strategy and innovation at
                    Revionics, an AI company that specializes in helping
                    retailers set prices, said its goal is not to tell retailers
                    exactly how much to charge individual customers. Rather, its
                    bread and butter is to provide companies with "all of the
                    analytics and predictive scenarios" to figure out prices
                    themselves.

                    Instead of waiting for customers to respond in real time to
                    price changes, Revionics' clients get a toolbox to test out
                    prices in advance. Then, by predicting how much consumers
                    will buy at different price points, Revionics helps
                    retailers manage their inventories.

                    [...] Mary Winn Pilkington, senior vice president of
                    investor relations and public relations at Tractor Supply
                    Co., told CNN it recently partnered with Revionics because
                    it wanted to more successfully adjust prices to "the
                    ever-changing market" to "attract and retain customers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The aim of partnering with Revionics wasn't to see how high
                    they can raise their prices without turning away too many
                    customers, she said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She noted that Tractor Supply Co. does use machine learning
                    "to curate specific offers individualized for customers,"
                    although Revionics is not involved in that aspect. This, she
                    said, "often leads to lower prices and better value on the
                    products and services our customers need."

                  <p>
                    Of course, like my Starbucks experience, it could also very
                    well lead to identifying customers who don't require
                    promotions at all.

                    The surprising discovery challenges long-held assumptions
                    that only photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and
                    algae, generate Earth's oxygen. But the new finding shows
                    there might be another way. It appears oxygen also can be
                    produced at the seafloor -- where no light can penetrate --
                    to support the oxygen-breathing (aerobic) sea life living in
                    complete darkness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Andrew Sweetman, of the Scottish Association for Marine
                    Science (SAMS), made the "dark oxygen" discovery while
                    conducting ship-based fieldwork in the Pacific Ocean.
                    Northwestern's Franz Geiger led the electrochemistry
                    experiments, which potentially explain the finding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For aerobic life to begin on the planet, there had to be
                    oxygen, and our understanding has been that Earth's oxygen
                    supply began with photosynthetic organisms," said Sweetman,
                    who leads the Seafloor Ecology and Biogeochemistry research
                    group at SAMS. "But we now know that there is oxygen
                    produced in the deep sea, where there is no light. I think
                    we, therefore, need to revisit questions like: Where could
                    aerobic life have begun?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Polymetallic nodules -- natural mineral deposits that form
                    on the ocean floor -- sit at the heart of the discovery. A
                    mix of various minerals, the nodules measure anywhere
                    between tiny particles and an average potato in size.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The polymetallic nodules that produce this oxygen contain
                    metals such as cobalt, nickel, copper, lithium and manganese
                    -- which are all critical elements used in batteries," said
                    Geiger, who co-authored the study. "Several large-scale
                    mining companies now aim to extract these precious elements
                    from the seafloor at depths of 10,000 to 20,000 feet below
                    the surface. We need to rethink how to mine these materials,
                    so that we do not deplete the oxygen source for deep-sea
                    life."
                  </p>

                    of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a mountainous submarine
                    ridge along the seafloor that extends nearly 4,500 miles
                    along the north-east quadrant of the Pacific Ocean. When his
                    team initially detected oxygen, he assumed the equipment

                    "When we first got this data, we thought the sensors were

                    only seen oxygen being consumed rather than produced,"
                    Sweetman said. "We would come home and recalibrate the
                    sensors, but, over the course of 10 years, these strange
                    oxygen readings kept showing up.

                    A new form of oxygen production has been detected on the
                    ocean floor, raising concerns about the impact of deep-sea
                    mining to this vital ecosystem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers have discovered large amounts of oxygen being
                    produced deep in the Pacific Ocean – and the source appears
                    to be lumps of metal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers made the discovery in a region of the ocean
                    4,000 metres down, where a large amount of “polymetallic
                    nodules” cover the ocean floor. The scientists believe that
                    these nodules are producing this “dark oxygen”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team said the discovery is fascinating, as it suggests
                    there is another source of oxygen production other than
                    photosynthesis. It is believed that these metal nodules are
                    acting as “geo-batteries”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These nodules are believed to play a role in the dark oxygen
                    production (DOP) by catalysing the splitting of water
                    molecules. The researchers say further investigation needs
                    to be done after this discovery to see how this process
                    could be impacted by

                  <p>
                    [...] Sweetman said that researchers should map the areas
                    where oxygen production is occurring before deep-sea mining
                    occurs, due to the potential impact it could have on
                    ecosystems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “If there’s oxygen being produced in large amounts, it’s
                    possibly going to be important for the animals that are
                    living there,” he said.

                    [...] Google's mention of a new option in Chrome for
                    managing third-party cookies seems hazy. The browser already
                    offers users a way to stop third-party cookies. The process
                    is as simple as going to Settings, selecting "Privacy and
                    security," clicking "Third-party cookies," and then turning
                    on the switch to block them. What more could Google add to
                    the browser without making the process too confusing?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I imagine this change simply means you will get an annoying
                    pop-up like this on every new website you visit -- kind of
                    what happens currently in the EU," Longacre said. "So yes,
                    expect more annoying EU-style pop-ups on every site you
                    visit. This will be bad for UX [user experience], but will
                    keep the regulators happy on both sides of the Atlantic."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, the entire process has been largely driven by
                    regulators, according to Longacre, as people are upset over
                    how their personal information is handled online. Users feel
                    that cookies and other digital advertising tools that
                    collect their data are intrusive, and they don't trust the
                    tech world, he added.

                    "Privacy is now regarded as a fundamental right, and
                    organizations are moving swiftly to safeguard consumer PII
                    (personally identifiable information), with limited or no
                    movement of consumer data and capturing of consent,"
                    Longacre said. "Google's announcement today will neither
                    slow down nor reverse this process."

                    Separation processes underpin most aspects of modern life.
                    From the food we eat, to the medicines we take, and the
                    fuels or batteries in our car, most products we use have
                    been through several separation processes. Moreover,
                    separation processes are important for minimizing waste and
                    the need for environmental remediation, such as direct air
                    capture of carbon dioxide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, in a world moving towards a circular economy,
                    separation processes will become even more critical. Here,
                    direct air capture might be used to provide carbon dioxide
                    as a feedstock for making many of the hydrocarbon products
                    we use today, but in a carbon-neutral, or even
                    carbon-negative, cycle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most importantly, alongside transitioning to renewable
                    energy and traditional carbon capture from point sources
                    like power plants,

                    Dr. Evangelos Papaioannou, Senior Lecturer in the School of
                    Engineering, Newcastle University, UK explains, “In a
                    departure from typical membrane operation, and as described
                    in the research paper, the team tested a new carbon
                    dioxide-permeable membrane with a variety of humidity
                    differences applied across it. When the humidity was higher
                    on the output side of the membrane, the membrane
                    spontaneously pumped carbon dioxide into that output
                    stream.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using X-ray micro-computed tomography with collaborators at
                    UCL and the University of Oxford, the team was able to
                    precisely characterize the structure of the membrane. This
                    enabled them to provide robust performance comparisons with
                    other state-of-the-art membranes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A key aspect of the work was modeling the processes
                    occurring in the membrane at the molecular scale. Using
                    density-functional-theory calculations with a collaborator
                    affiliated to both Victoria University of Wellington and
                    Imperial College London, the team identified ‘carriers’
                    within the membrane. The carrier uniquely transports both
                    carbon dioxide and water but nothing else. Water is required
                    to release carbon dioxide from the membrane, and carbon
                    dioxide is required to release water. Because of this, the
                    energy from a humidity difference can be used to drive
                    carbon dioxide through the membrane from a low concentration
                    to a higher concentration.

                    Prof Metcalfe adds, “This was a real team effort over
                    several years. We are very grateful for the contributions
                    from our collaborators, and for the support from the Royal
                    Academy of Engineering and the Engineering &amp; Physical
                    Sciences Research Council.”

                    Last week, Applied Materials pulled back the curtain on its
                    latest materials engineering solutions designed to enable
                    copper wiring to scale down to 2nm dimensions and below
                    while also reducing electrical resistance and strengthening
                    chips for 3D stacking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company's Black Diamond low-k dielectric material has
                    been offered since the early 2000s. It surrounds copper
                    wires with a special film engineered to reduce the buildup
                    of electrical charges that increase power consumption and
                    cause interference between electrical signals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Applied Materials has now
                    <a
                      href="https://ir.appliedmaterials.com/news-releases/news-release-details/applied-materials-unveils-chip-wiring-innovations-more-energy"

                    with an enhanced version of Black Diamond, which reduces the
                    minimum k-value even further, enabling copper wiring scaling
                    to the 2nm node while also increasing mechanical strength –
                    a critical property as chipmakers look to stack multiple
                    logic and memory dies vertically.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But scaling the copper wiring itself as dimensions shrink is
                    another enormous challenge. Today's most cutting-edge logic
                    chips can pack over 60 miles of copper wires that are
                    fashioned by first etching trenches into the dielectric
                    material and then depositing an ultra-thin barrier layer to
                    prevent copper migration. A liner layer goes down next to
                    aid copper adhesion before the final copper deposition fills
                    the remaining space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem is that at 2nm dimensions and below, the barrier
                    and liner layers consume an increasingly large percentage of
                    the available trench volume, leaving little room for
                    sufficient copper fill and risking high resistance and
                    reliability issues. Applied Materials has solved this
                    predicament with this brand-new materials concoction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their latest Integrated Materials Solution (IMS) combines
                    six different core technologies into one high-vacuum system,
                    including an industry-first pairing of ruthenium and cobalt
                    to form an ultra-thin 2nm binary metal liner. This allows a
                    33% reduction in liner thickness compared to previous
                    generations while also improving surface properties for
                    seamless, void-free copper adhesion and reflow. The end
                    result is up to 25% lower electrical resistance in chip
                    wiring to boost performance and reduce power leakage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Applied Materials claims that all leading logic chipmakers
                    have already adopted its new copper barrier seed IMS with
                    ruthenium CVD technology for 3nm chip production, with 2nm
                    nodes expected to follow.

                    UK communications regulator Ofcom has banned mid-contract
                    price rises linked to inflation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The change, which comes into effect from January 2025, means
                    that price rises must be clearly written into contracts.
                    Ofcom noted that BT and Vodafone had already changed their
                    pricing practices accordingly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cristina Luna-Esteban, Ofcom Telecoms Policy Director,
                    criticized the practice of vendors tying customers into
                    contracts where the price could change based on inflation.
                    Future inflation is difficult to predict, after all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Luna-Esteban said. "We're stepping in on behalf of phone,
                    broadband and pay TV customers to stamp out this practice,
                    so people can be certain of the price they will pay, compare
                    deals more easily and take advantage of the competitive
                    market we have in the UK."

                    after UK inflation soared during the previous years, making
                    it impossible for customers to predict what they might be
                    paying during a contract's term. The imposition of early
                    termination fees for customers seeking to escape what they
                    saw as an unexpected rise added to the pain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In theory, a customer could exit a contract without penalty
                    if they weren't made aware of potential rises when signing
                    the contract. However, providers were able to get around
                    this by simply saying prices would rise by whatever the
                    consumer price index was at the time, plus a certain
                    percentage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, the customer was made aware of a rise – but
                    didn't know what it would be.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ofcom's solution is to require the provider to clearly
                    disclose the rises to avoid a situation in which customers
                    do not know how much they will be expected to pay during
                    their contract term.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Finally, broadband and mobile customers will know
                    ahead of time exactly what they will pay for the duration of
                    a contract, making it easier for them to properly manage
                    their finances."

                    The change to remove the word <em>caffra</em> from species
                    names was proposed by the plant taxonomist Prof Gideon Smith
                    of Nelson Mandela University in South Africa, and his
                    colleague Prof Estrela Figueiredo. They have campaigned for
                    years for changes to be made to the international system for
                    giving scientific names to plants and animals in order to
                    permit the deletion and substitution of past names deemed
                    objectionable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are very pleased with the retroactive and permanent
                    eradication of a racial slur from botanical nomenclature,"
                    Smith told the <em>Observer</em>. "It is most encouraging
                    that more than 60% of our international colleagues supported
                    this proposal."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And the Australian plant taxonomist Kevin Thiele – who had
                    originally pressed for historical past names to be subject
                    to changes as well as future names – told
                    <em>Nature</em> that last week's moves were "at least a
                    sliver of recognition of the issue".
                  </p>

                      >only a part of the taxonomic controversy</a
                    >, however. Naming animals after racists, fascists and other
                    controversial figures cause just as many headaches as those
                    posed by plants, say scientists. Examples include a brown,
                    eyeless beetle which has been named after Adolf Hitler. Nor
                    is <em>Anophthalmus hitleri</em> alone. Many other species'
                    names recall individuals that offend, such as the moth
                    <em>Hypopta mussolinii</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature
                    (ICZN) has so far refused to consider changing its rules to
                    allow the removal of racist or fascist references. Renaming
                    would be disruptive, while replacement names could one day
                    be seen as offensive "as attitudes change in the future", it
                    announced in the
                    <em>Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society</em>last year.
                    Nevertheless, many researchers have acknowledged that some
                    changes will have to be made to zoological nomenclature
                    rules in the near future.

                    We were sick of the academic publishing racket and had
                    decided to try something different. We wanted to launch a
                    journal that would be truly open access, ensuring anyone
                    could read our articles. This will be published by the
                    <a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/"
                      >Open Library of Humanities</a
                    >, a not-for-profit publisher funded by a consortium of
                    libraries and other institutions. When academic publishing
                    is run on a not-for-profit basis, it works reasonably well.
                    These publishers provide a real service and typically sell
                    the final product at a reasonable price to their own
                    community. So why aren't there more of them?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To answer this, we have to go back a few decades, when
                    commercial publishers began
                    <a

                    journals from university presses. Exploiting their monopoly
                    position, they then sharply raised prices. Today, a library
                    subscription to a single journal in the humanities or social
                    sciences typically costs more than £1,000 a year. Worse
                    still, publishers often "<a
                      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1150298/"
                      >bundle</a
                    >" journals together, forcing libraries to buy ones they
                    don't want in order to have access to ones they do. Between
                    2010 and 2019, UK universities paid
                    <a
                      href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade"
                      >more than £1bn</a
                    >
                    in journal subscriptions and other publishing charges. More
                    than 90% of these fees went to the big five commercial
                    publishers (UCL and Manchester shelled out over £4m each).
                    It's worth remembering that the universities funded this
                    research, paid the salaries of the academics who produced it
                    and then had to pay millions of pounds to commercial
                    publishers in order to access the end product.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even more astonishing is the fact these publishers often
                    charge authors for the privilege of publishing in their
                    journals. In recent years, large publishers have begun
                    offering so-called "open access" articles that are free to
                    read. On the surface, this might sound like a welcome
                    improvement. But for-profit publishers provide open access
                    to readers only by charging authors, often thousands of
                    pounds, to publish their own articles. Who ends up paying
                    these substantial author fees? Once again, universities. In
                    2022 alone, UK institutions of higher education paid
                    <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10787392"
                      >more than £112m</a
                    >
                    to the big five to secure open-access publication for their
                    authors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This trend is having an insidious impact on knowledge
                    production. Commercial publishers are incentivised to try to
                    publish as many articles and journals as possible, because
                    each additional article brings in more profit. This has led
                    to a proliferation of junk journals that publish
                    <a
                      href="https://www.wsj.com/science/academic-studies-research-paper-mills-journals-publishing-f5a3d4bc"
                      >fake research</a
                    >, and has increased the pressure on rigorous journals to
                    weaken their quality controls. It's never been more evident
                    that for-profit publishing simply does not align with the
                    aims of scholarly inquiry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is an obvious alternative: universities, libraries,
                    and academic funding agencies can cut out the intermediary
                    and directly fund journals themselves, at a far lower cost.
                    This would remove commercial pressures from the editorial
                    process, preserve editorial integrity and make research
                    accessible to all. The term for this is
                    <a
                      href="https://www.coalition-s.org/diamond-open-access/#:~:text=Diamond%20Open%20Access%20refers%20to,and%20academic-owned%20publishing%20initiatives."
                      >"diamond" open access</a
                    >, which means the publishers charge neither authors,
                    editors, nor readers (this is how our new journal will
                    operate). Librarians have been urging this for years. So why
                    haven't academics already migrated to diamond journals?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The reason is that such journals require alternative funding
                    sources, and even if such funding were in place, academics
                    still face a massive collective action problem: we want a
                    new arrangement but each of us, individually, is strongly
                    incentivised to stick with the status quo. Career
                    advancement depends heavily on publishing in journals with
                    established name recognition and prestige, and these
                    journals are often owned by commercial publishers. Many
                    academics – particularly early-career researchers trying to
                    secure long-term employment in an extremely difficult job
                    market – cannot afford to take a chance on new, untested
                    journals on their own.

                    Beyond disappearing ice cover, the remaining ice is also
                    growing less reflective as warming temperatures and
                    increased rainfall create thinner, wetter ice and more melt
                    ponds that reflect less solar radiation. This effect has
                    been most pronounced in the Arctic, where sea ice has become
                    less reflective in the sunniest parts of the year, and the
                    new study raises the possibility that it could be an
                    important factor in the Antarctic, too—in addition to lost
                    sea ice cover.

                    Europe’s largest local authority faces a $15.58 million (£12
                    million) bill for manually auditing accounts which should
                    have been supported by an Oracle ERP systems installed in
                    April 2022.

                    The £3.2 billion ($4.1 billion) budget authority has become
                    infamous for its ERP project disaster, which has seen its

                    Fusion, a customer win co-founder and CTO Larry Ellison once

                    The delayed project left the council without auditable
                    accounts, and without security features, along with costs
                    climbing from around £20 million to as much as £131 million.

                    Yesterday, Mark Stocks, head of public sector practice at
                    external auditors Grant Thornton,
                    <a
                      href="https://birmingham.public-i.tv/core/portal/webcast_interactive/890082"

                    that officials had told him the new accounting
                    “out-of-the-box” system might not be ready until March 2026,
                    nearly four years after the failing customized system first
                    went live.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lack of a functioning accounting system was making it
                    costly and time consuming to produce a full audit, the
                    auditors concluded after exploratory work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Problems with the customized ERP system were multiple,
                    but cash management, bank reconciliation and accounts
                    receivable were of particular concern. The council has
                    bought third-party software — CivicaPay/Civica Income
                    Management — as the replacement for the banking system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Stocks said officials had been working hard to improve the
                    current Oracle system, and said he did not “lose that
                    message.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nonetheless, serious issues continue. “You're not going to
                    have a fully functioning finance system and cash system
                    [until] April next year. The actual financial ledger could
                    be April 2026. That's really difficult from a finance
                    officer point of view [and] it's particularly difficult from
                    an external audit point of view to draw a conclusion on your
                    accounts,” he said.

                    A research team has proposed a revolutionary polymorphic
                    network environment (PNE) in their study, which seeks to
                    achieve global scalability while addressing the diverse
                    needs of evolving network services. Their framework
                    challenges traditional network designs by creating a
                    versatile “network of networks” that overcomes the
                    limitations of current systems, paving the way for scalable
                    and adaptable network architectures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A recent paper published in <em>Engineering</em> by
                    scientists Wu Jiangxing and his research team introduces a
                    theoretical framework that promises to transform network
                    systems and architectures. The study tackles a critical
                    issue in network design: how to achieve global scalability
                    while meeting the varied demands of evolving services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For decades, the quest for an ideal network capable of
                    seamlessly scaling across various dimensions has remained
                    elusive. The team, however, has identified a critical
                    barrier known as the “impossible service-level agreement
                    (S), multiplexity (M), and variousness (V) triangle”
                    dilemma, which highlights the inherent limitations of
                    traditional unimorphic network systems. These systems
                    struggle to adapt to the growing complexity of services and
                    application scenarios while maintaining global scalability
                    throughout the network’s life cycle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To overcome this challenge, the researchers propose a
                    paradigm shift in network development—an approach they term
                    the polymorphic network environment (PNE). At the core of
                    this framework lies the separation of application network
                    systems from the underlying infrastructure environment. By
                    leveraging core technologies such as network elementization
                    and dynamic resource aggregation, the PNE enables the
                    creation of a versatile “network of networks” capable of
                    accommodating diverse service requirements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Through extensive theoretical analysis and environment
                    testing, the team demonstrates the viability of the PNE
                    model. Results indicate that the framework not only supports
                    multiple application network modalities simultaneously but
                    also aligns with technical and economic constraints, thus
                    paving the way for scalable and adaptable network
                    architectures.

                    in <i>Science Advances</i> reveals a surprising twist in the
                    evolutionary history of complex life. Researchers at Queen
                    Mary University of London have discovered that a
                    single-celled organism, a close relative of animals, harbors
                    the remnants of ancient giant viruses woven into its own
                    genetic code. This finding sheds light on how complex
                    organisms may have acquired some of their genes and
                    highlights the dynamic interplay between viruses and their
                    hosts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study focused on a microbe called Amoebidium, a
                    unicellular parasite found in freshwater environments. By
                    analyzing Amoebidium's genome, the researchers led by Dr.
                    Alex de Mendoza Soler, Senior Lecturer at Queen Mary's
                    School of Biological and Behavioural Sciences, found a
                    surprising abundance of genetic material originating from
                    giant viruses—some of the largest viruses known to science.
                    These viral sequences were heavily methylated, a chemical
                    tag that often silences genes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "These findings challenge our understanding of the
                    relationship between viruses and their hosts," says Dr. de
                    Mendoza Soler. "Traditionally, viruses are seen as invaders,
                    but this study suggests a more complex story. Viral
                    insertions may have played a role in the evolution of
                    complex organisms by providing them with new genes. And this
                    is allowed by the chemical taming of these intruders DNA."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, the findings in Amoebidium offer intriguing
                    parallels to how our own genomes interact with viruses.
                    Similar to Amoebidium, humans and other mammals have
                    remnants of ancient viruses, called endogenous retroviruses,
                    integrated into their DNA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While these remnants were previously thought to be inactive
                    "junk DNA," some might now be beneficial. However, unlike
                    the giant viruses found in Amoebidium, Endogenous
                    retroviruses are much smaller, and the human genome is
                    significantly larger. Future research can explore these
                    similarities and differences to understand the complex
                    interplay between viruses and complex life forms.

                    disrupted operations across various sectors, notably
                    impacting airlines, banks, and healthcare providers. The
                    issue was caused by a problematic channel file delivered via
                    an update from the popular cybersecurity service provider,
                    CrowdStrike. CrowdStrike confirmed that this crash did not
                    impact Mac or Linux PCs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It turns out that similar problems have been occurring for
                    months without much awareness, despite the fact that many
                    may view this as an isolated incident. Users of Debian and
                    Rocky Linux also experienced significant disruptions as a
                    result of CrowdStrike updates, raising serious concerns
                    about the company's software update and testing procedures.
                    These occurrences highlight potential risks for customers
                    who rely on their products daily.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In April, a CrowdStrike update caused all Debian Linux
                    servers in a civic tech lab to crash simultaneously and
                    refuse to boot. The update proved incompatible with the
                    latest stable version of Debian, despite the specific Linux
                    configuration being supposedly supported. The lab's IT team
                    discovered that removing CrowdStrike allowed the machines to
                    boot and reported the incident.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A team member involved in the incident expressed
                    dissatisfaction with CrowdStrike's delayed response. It took
                    them weeks to provide a root cause analysis after
                    acknowledging the issue a day later. The analysis revealed
                    that the Debian Linux configuration was not included in
                    their test matrix.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Crowdstrike's model seems to be 'we push software to your
                    machines any time we want, whether or not it's urgent,
                    without testing it'," lamented the team member.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This was not an isolated incident. CrowdStrike users also
                    reported similar issues after upgrading to RockyLinux 9.4,
                    with their servers crashing due to a kernel bug. Crowdstrike
                    support acknowledged the issue, highlighting a pattern of
                    inadequate testing and insufficient attention to
                    compatibility issues across different operating systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To avoid such issues in the future, CrowdStrike should
                    prioritize rigorous testing across all supported
                    configurations. Additionally, organizations should approach
                    CrowdStrike updates with caution and have contingency plans
                    in place to mitigate potential disruptions.

                    amazing that they can live on any organic matter," Lind Sam
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Niels Thomas Eriksen, a biologist at Aalborg University,
                    told AFP that "insects can eat materials that other animals
                    probably won't so we can make better use" of agricultural
                    byproducts and food waste.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Minimizing waste is one of Enorm's key aims and the
                    manufacturer stressed that the rearing of insects
                    facilitates "the recycling of nutrients".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It takes between 40 and 50 days to produce the finished
                    product, which is mainly flour with a protein content of 55
                    percent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is then distributed across Europe—although Enorm remains
                    discreet about the identity of its customers—used for feed
                    for pig, poultry, fish and pet farms.

                  <p>
                    Yup. A source told IndieWire that Amazon MGM Studios is
                    currently in early development on a sequel to "Spaceballs."
                    Mel Brooks is returning to produce the feature, a direct
                    follow-up to his 1987 "Star Wars" spoof. Josh Gad is also on
                    board to star in and also produce what we'll call
                    "Spaceballs 2."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Josh Greenbaum, who directed "Barb &amp; Star Go to
                    Vista Del Mar" and this year's documentary "Will &amp;
                    Harper," is attached to direct the sequel. He's working from
                    a script by Benji Samit, Dan Hernandez, and Josh Gad. Samit
                    and Hernandez are known for working on "Teenage Mutant Ninja
                    Turtles: Mutant Mayhem," "Pokemon Detective Pikachu," and
                    the upcoming "Lego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Spaceballs" from 1987 starred Brooks, Rick Moranis as
                    Dark Helmet, the late John Candy as the Chewbacca parody
                    Barf, and Bill Pullman as the hero Lone Starr. In classic
                    Brooks fashion the film mercilessly ripped off "Star Wars"
                    and featured everything from heroes fighting with pseudo
                    lightsabers extending from rings, characters using the
                    "Schwartz" to save the day, and even Brooks playing a Yoda
                    parody, Yogurt, who shamelessly plugged fourth-wall-breaking
                    "Spaceballs" merchandise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The film made $38 million worldwide but has become part of
                    the canon of staples for Brooks acolytes. Brooks recently
                    wrote the Hulu series "History of the World: Part II," a
                    sequel to his 1981 sketch film. That series also featured
                    Gad in one episode playing Shakespeare.

                    contacting Amazon seeking assistance. They worry Amazon
                    might still be reselling used items, but they cannot stop
                    using the platform because Amazon remains their primary

                    In the search for new compounds, the team started with a
                    chemical database of more than 40,000 natural substances. It
                    was their aim to determine how effectively each substance
                    would bind to the corresponding receptor. And, in addition,
                    they had to ascertain whether these had the properties
                    required of a pharmaceutical drug.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such a compound must be water-soluble to some extent, for
                    example. This research required calculations in the form of
                    approximations, with the results becoming increasingly more
                    precise the more frequently these calculations were
                    performed. Each substance was the subject of some 750,000
                    individual calculations. Such a colossal number of
                    calculations would vastly exceed the capacity of a standard
                    PC. Therefore, the team utilized the MOGON supercomputer at
                    JGU. The top 100 candidate products of these calculations
                    were subsequently assessed using other analytical methods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The resultant top ten found their way into the lab, where
                    they underwent biochemical analysis. The initial priority
                    was to establish safety. Using preparations of human kidney
                    cells, the researchers looked at whether higher
                    concentrations of each substance would prove toxic to the
                    cells and even kill them. Finally, two other aspects had to
                    be subjected to testing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “We needed to confirm that the high binding energy of the
                    substances to the pain receptors that had been predicted by
                    the theoretical calculations was actually also produced in
                    the real physical world,” said Professor Thomas Efferth,
                    head of the JGU Department of Pharmaceutical Biology.
                    However, binding of a substance to the receptors is not
                    alone sufficient. The binding must also influence the
                    functioning of the receptors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thus, the research team used a second test system to assess
                    whether there was the kind of inhibition of biological
                    activity that occurs during opioid use. One of the two
                    compounds passed all tests with flying colors: aniquinazolin
                    B, the substance present in the marine fungus
                    <em>Aspergillus nidulans</em>. “The results of our
                    investigations indicate that this substance may have effects
                    similar to those of opioids. At the same time, it causes far
                    fewer undesirable reactions,” concluded Roxana Damiescu.

                    Based on the available knowledge, FAS also tried to guess
                    how much nuclear material North Korea has. It then used that
                    number to extrapolate the number of nukes it’s sitting on.
                    “We estimate North Korea could possess up to 81 kilograms of
                    plutonium and 1,800 kilograms of [highly-enriched uranium],
                    which could supply North Korea with enough material to
                    potentially build up to 90 nuclear weapons,” it said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Its estimates were conservative. “These lower-end
                    projections mean that North Korea could potentially build up
                    to 20 uranium-only design and 33 composite design weapons if
                    using the same fissile material allocations, for a possible
                    capacity to build up to 53 nuclear weapons,” it said. The
                    FAS estimated that the DPRK could build around 6 nukes a
                    year and bring its numbers up to 130 by the end of the
                    decade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Buried in the report’s scientific research is something more
                    troubling than the nukes themselves: a discussion of how
                    North Korea plans to use them. Some, but not all, countries
                    with nukes maintain something called a “no-first-use
                    policy.” It’s a codified promise that they’ll only use their
                    nukes if someone else attacks them with nukes first. China
                    has a no-first-use policy. The United States and Russia do
                    not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    North Korea once promised it would never use nuclear weapons
                    preemptively, but it’s changed its mind. According to the
                    FAS report, North Korea’s parliament passed a law giving it
                    the right to launch nukes preemptively in 2022. One year
                    later, the North Korean government codified under the
                    country’s constitution its right to ‘deter war and protect
                    regional and global peace by rapidly developing nuclear
                    weapons to a higher level.’

                    NASA and Boeing engineers are evaluating results from last
                    week’s engine tests at NASA’s White Sands Test Facility in
                    New Mexico as the team works through plans to return the
                    agency’s Boeing Crew Flight Test from the International
                    Space Station in the coming weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Teams completed ground hot fire testing at White Sands and
                    are working to evaluate the test data and inspect the test
                    engine. The ongoing ground analysis is expected to continue
                    throughout the week. Working with a reaction control system
                    thruster built for a future Starliner spacecraft, ground
                    teams fired the engine through similar inflight conditions
                    the spacecraft experienced on the way to the space station.
                    The ground tests also included stress-case firings, and
                    replicated conditions Starliner’s thrusters will experience
                    from undocking to deorbit burn, where the thrusters will
                    fire to slow Starliner’s speed to bring it out of orbit for
                    landing in the southwestern United States.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For a detailed overview of the test plans, listen to a
                    replay of a recent media teleconference with NASA and Boeing
                    leadership:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “I am extremely proud of the NASA, Boeing team for their
                    hard work in executing a very complex test series,” said
                    Steve Stich, manager, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. “We
                    collected an incredible amount of data on the thruster that
                    could help us better understand what is going on in flight.
                    Next, our team has moved into engine tear downs and
                    inspections which will provide additional insight as we
                    analyze the results and evaluate next steps.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Integrated ground teams also are preparing for an in-depth
                    Agency Flight Test Readiness Review, which will evaluate
                    data related to the spacecraft’s propulsion system
                    performance before its return to Earth. The date of the
                    agency review has not yet been solidified.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA and Boeing leadership plan to discuss the testing and
                    analysis work in detail during a media briefing next week.
                    More information on the briefing will be made available
                    soon.

                    Google will soon make its own contribution to the problem of
                    link rot by shutting down the Google URL Shortener service
                    in 2025.
                  </p>

                    >
                    as an attempt to make lengthy links manageable by feeding
                    them into Google's shortener, which spat out shorter ones in
                    the form of https://goog.gl/*. Nine years later,
                    <a
                      href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/transitioning-google-url-shortener-to-firebase-dynamic-links/"
                      >Google decided to pull the service</a
                    >
                    and direct users to Firebase Dynamic Links (FDL) instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the time, Google said, "All existing links will continue
                    to redirect to the intended destination."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However,
                    <a
                      href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-url-shortener-links-will-no-longer-be-available/"
                      >as of August 25, 2025,</a
                    >
                    any links built with the Google URL shortener in the form of
                    https://goog.gl/* won't return a response.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It'll be a slow death for the service. From August 23, 2024,
                    goo.gl links will show an interstitial page for a percentage
                    of users warning that the link's days are numbered. As the
                    shutdown date nears, that percentage will increase.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once shutdown happens, the links will simply return a 404
                    response.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The interstitial links could be a headache in their own
                    right since there is every chance they could interfere with
                    a redirect flow. And this is why Google's advising engineers
                    to transition those goog.gl links as quickly as possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But transition them to where? Google's earlier advice to
                    move to FDL might have sounded good in 2018, but the company
                    has since
                    <a
                      href="https://firebase.google.com/support/dynamic-links-faq"
                      >deprecated the functionality</a
                    >, and on August 25, 2025, the service will stop working,
                    alongside the Google URL Shortener.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The challenge facing engineers is tracking down all the
                    places where an affected link might be used; Link Rot –
                    where links that might have once worked but now return a 404
                    – has become an increasing problem as the World Wide Web has
                    matured. Decisions such as Google's will only serve to make
                    the problem worse.

                    readable (normally, this process is invisible, because the

                    106 eggs of rare Siamese crocodile species in a western
                    Cambodian wildlife sanctuary, officials said Thursday,
                    calling it the biggest discovery in the last 20 years,
                    giving new hope for the world's rarest crocodile species'
                    survival in the wild.

                  <p>
                    The group discovered the species eggs in Cardamom National
                    Park in May. Between June 27 and 30, a total of 60 eggs were
                    successfully hatched, according to a joint statement issued
                    by the ministries of agriculture and environment along with
                    the conservation group Fauna &amp; Flora.

                    "This discovery indicates that the area is a key habitat for
                    wild crocodiles, providing hope for the species recovery,"
                    the statement said.

                  <p>
                    The area and the young reptiles have been under the
                    protection of Cardamom National Park Wildlife Sanctuary
                    rangers, it added.
                  </p>

                    The crocodile species was once widespread across Southeast
                    Asia but is now listed as critically endangered by the
                    International Union for the Conservation of Nature. It had
                    all but disappeared by the 1990s due to a combination of
                    poaching, habitat destruction and crossbreeding with other
                    crocodile species.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cambodian environment minister, Eang Sophalleth, said his
                    ministry is working on the conservation and habitat
                    restoration of these critically endangered Siamese
                    crocodiles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The Siamese crocodiles play an important role in the
                    ecosystem and the discovery of the five nets successfully
                    hatching 60 eggs reflects that the Cardamom National Park is
                    a safe and suitable habitat for this species," Sophalleth
                    said in Thursday's statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's believed only about 1,000 Siamese crocodiles remain in
                    the wild, with more than 300 of them in Cambodia.

                    Researchers at the University of Tokyo and RIKEN have
                    discovered that ferromagnetism can be induced by increasing
                    particle motility in quantum systems, where repulsive forces
                    between atoms maintain the order.

                    Japan’s largest comprehensive research institution, have
                    shown that ferromagnetism, an ordered state of atoms, can be
                    induced by increasing particle motility and that repulsive
                    forces between atoms are sufficient to maintain it.

                    The discovery not only extends the concept of active matter
                    to quantum systems but also contributes to the development
                    of novel technologies that rely on the magnetic properties
                    of particles, such as magnetic memory and quantum computing.
                    The findings were published in the journal
                    <em>Physical Review Research</em>.

                    Flocking birds, swarming bacteria, cellular flows. These are
                    all examples of active matter, a state in which individual
                    agents, such as birds, bacteria, or cells, self-organize.
                    The agents change from a disordered to an ordered state in
                    what is called a “phase transition.” As a result, they move
                    together in an organized fashion without an external
                    controller.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Previous studies have shown that the concept of active
                    matter can apply to a wide range of scales, from nanometers
                    (biomolecules) to meters (animals),” says Takasan, the first
                    author. “However, it has not been known whether the physics
                    of active matter can be applied usefully in the quantum
                    regime. We wanted to fill in that gap.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “It was surprising at first to find that the ordering
                    can appear without elaborate interactions between the agents
                    in the quantum model,” Takasan reflects on the finding. “It
                    was different from what was expected based on biophysical
                    models.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researcher took a multi-faceted approach to ensure their
                    finding was not a fluke. Thankfully, the results of computer
                    simulations, mean-field theory, a statistical theory of
                    particles, and mathematical proofs based on linear algebra
                    were all consistent. This strengthened the reliability of
                    their finding, the first step in a new line of research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The extension of active matter to the quantum world has
                    only recently begun, and many aspects are still open,” says
                    Takasan. “We would like to further develop the theory of
                    quantum active matter and reveal its universal properties.”

                    The European Space Agency has begun work on a planetary
                    defence mission that will intercept an asteroid predicted to
                    come within 32,000km of Earth in 2029.

                    The Rapid Apophis Mission for Space Safety (RAMSES) mission
                    targets asteroid 99942, aka Apophis, which is about 375
                    meters wide – the length of 30 giant squid – and expected to
                    pass closer to Earth than some geosynchronous satellites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Astronomers have ruled out any chance that the asteroid
                    will collide with our planet for at least the next 100

                    This fly-by is therefore an opportunity to observe Apophis
                    in the hope doing so helps humanity to learn how future
                    visitors of this sort might be deflected.

                    The ESA's Space Safety program – its team dedicated to
                    gathering and publishing info about threats from space –
                    green-lit initial work on the mission on Tuesday, meaning
                    the agency can "kickstart mission prep using current
                    resources," according to ESA director general Josef
                    Aschbacher.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Should the mission receive full support, Ramses will
                    launch in April 2028, rendezvous with Apophis beginning in
                    February 2029, and accompany it through its flyby set to
                    occur two months later. Researchers will use the opportunity
                    to study the effect of Earth's gravity on the asteroid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "All we need to do is watch as Apophis is stretched and
                    squeezed by strong tidal forces that may trigger landslides
                    and other disturbances and reveal new material from beneath
                    the surface," explained France's National Center for
                    Scientific Research (CNRS) director Patrick Michel.

                  <p>
                    A suite of scientific instruments will do the "watching" by
                    measuring asteroid shape, surface, orbit, rotation and
                    orientation before and after the flyby, as well as asteroid
                    composition, interior structure, cohesion, mass, density,
                    and porosity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ESA expects measuring those properties will reveal some
                    secrets on how best to knock a future object off course, and
                    perhaps also offer insights into the formation of the Solar
                    System.

                    [...] The device was fabricated on a chip at EPFL’s
                    <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/research/facilities/cmi/"

                    by creating a nanopore at the center of a silicon nitride
                    membrane. The researchers added palladium and graphite
                    layers to create nano-channels for ions. As a current flows
                    through the chip, the ions percolate through the channels
                    and converge at the pore, where their pressure creates a
                    blister between the chip surface and the graphite. As the
                    graphite layer is forced up by the blister, the device
                    becomes more conductive, switching its memory state to ‘on’.
                    Since the graphite layer stays lifted, even without a
                    current, the device ‘remembers’ its previous state. A
                    negative voltage puts the layers back into contact,
                    resetting the memory to the ‘off’ state.

                    “Ion channels in the brain undergo structural changes inside
                    a synapse, so this also mimics biology,” says LBEN PhD
                    student Yunfei Teng, who worked on fabricating the devices –
                    dubbed highly asymmetric channels (HACs) in reference to the
                    shape of the ion flow toward the central pores.

                When Don Denkinger mistakenly called Jorge Orta safe at first

                Cardinals that led them to blowing a 1-0 lead and losing the
                game. Although the Cardinals proceeded to get blown out 11-0 in
                game 7, but Denkinger is often blamed for the Cardinals losing
                the series. Following the blown call, two St. Louis radio
                personalities doxxed Denkinger, who received hate mail and even
                death threats from irate fans. At the time, Cardinals manager
                Whitey Herzog was furious at Denkinger. After the series was
                over, Herzog became very dismayed by the harassment Denkinger
                received from St. Louis. It was so severe that

              <p>
                Jim Joyce was also known for a missed force out at first base,
                this time what should have been the last out of a perfect game
                for Armando Galarraga, an otherwise mediocre pitcher attempting
                to complete one of the rarest feats in all of baseball. The
                first base umpire generally watches to see whether the fielder's
                foot is on the first base and when the runner's foot touches the
                base, listening for the sound of the ball popping into the
                fielder's glove. It's an extremely difficult call that umpires
                get correct a remarkably high percentage of the time. In this
                case, Joyce believed that the runner, Jason Donald, reached the
                base before the baseball arrived in the fielder's glove, and
                <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/otl/news/story?id=5993137"
                  >he called the runner safe</a
                >. Galarraga retired the next hitter, but there was no way after
                the game to correct the blown call. After seeing a replay, Joyce
                held a press conference in which he tearfully admitted publicly
                that he blew the call and felt awful for costing Galarraga the
                perfect game.
              </p>
              <p>
                Had MLB made use of the available technology, neither Denkinger
                nor Joyce would be remember for missing calls. It's possible the
                Cardinals might have imploded and lost the World Series anyway.
                In the case of Joyce, the play would have been reviewed for a
                minute or two, the umpire would have raised his fist to signal
                an out, and the Detroit Tigers players and coaches would have
                run onto the field after a brief awkward pause to celebrate the
                perfect game. Denkinger and Joyce were excellent umpires who
                were well-respected by players and managers but are both mostly
                known for making a single bad call that could have easily been
                corrected with the proper VAR tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite the potential for technology to further assist umpires
                in getting calls correct, there is significant resistance to
                automatic balls and strikes. While the ball-tracking technology
                is widely accepted by tennis fans, there are concerns that
                <a
                  href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/40377683/mlb-robot-umpires-automated-balls-strikes-challenge-system-umps-majors"
                  >baseball fans might see pitches that appear to be balls get
                  called as strikes, and that the technology would be viewed as
                  untrustworthy</a
                >. Part of the issue is that the strike zone is actually a
                three-dimensional volume that is 17 inches wide and 17 inches
                deep. If the flight of the ball intersects any part of the zone,
                it's a strike. For pitches with a high rate of forward spin and
                a lot of vertical break, it could clip the bottom part of the
                zone at the front of home plate, be caught well below the
                batter's knees, and still get called a strike.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some fans are also reluctant to end the skill of pitch framing,
                in which a catcher receives a pitch that's a ball but catches it
                in a manner to give the illusion of it being a strike. The
                umpire is fooled into calling the pitch a strike anyway, giving
                an advantage to the pitcher. One estimate suggests that the best

              <p>
                Instead of fully embracing robot umps to call balls and strikes,
                MLB intends to test a system of challenging balls and strikes at
                AAA this season, which is the highest level of minor league
                baseball. Teams will receive a certain number of challenges each
                game, where a ball or strike call can be reviewed and, if
                necessary, overturned. Part of the issue with fully embracing
                automatic balls and strikes is the need to determine how to set
                the "correct" strike zone. One option is to estimate it from the
                batter's height. The other is to determine in on every pitch
                based on the batter's stance, using the sz_top and sz_bot fields
                in Statcast data. If the strike zone was determined by the
                batter's stance on every pitch, a batter could use an
                exaggerated stance to make the strike zone artificially small,
                making it difficult to throw strikes. Although catchers would no
                longer be able to steal strikes with pitch framing, adjusting
                the strike zone for every pitch could allow hitters to steal
                balls.

                [<b>UPDATE</b>] In his meeting with the Baseball Writers'
                Association of America prior to the All-Star Game,
                <a
                  href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/40576449/robot-umpires-tested-spring-training"
                  >MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said that "robot umpires" would
                  probably be tested in spring training in 2025 and could be
                  implemented in the 2026 season</a
                >. "Robot umpires" are the colloquial term in baseball for an
                automated system for calling balls and strikes using computer
                vision to track the flight of the baseball and whether a pitch
                crosses the strike zone. The main concern for MLB seems to be
                how the strike zone will be determined, whether it will be
                estimated from each player's height, or if it will be based on a
                recent average of the size of each player's actual strike zone.
                One of the 2024 rule changes in the minor leagues was to
                <a
                  href="https://www.baseballamerica.com/stories/milb-rules-changes-for-2024-will-tweak-strike-zone-in-triple-a/"
                  >define the automated strike zone from the median of recent
                  pitches that were put into play</a
                >, limiting the opportunity for hitters to manipulated the
                strike zone with an exaggerated crouch. Although fully automated
                ball and strike calls were tested in the minor leagues, this was
                replaced with a challenge system that is likely to be
                implemented in the major leagues in 2026. Human umpires will
                still call balls and strikes, and I anticipate that this system
                will mostly be used to challenge borderline pitches that could
                be strike three or ball four.

                    UPDATED An update to a product from infosec vendor
                    CrowdStrike is bricking computers running Windows.

                  <p>
                    The Register has found numerous accounts of Windows 10 PCs
                    crashing, displaying the Blue Screen of Death, then being
                    unable to reboot.

                    "We're seeing BSOD Org wide that are being caused by
                    csagent.sys, and it's taking down critical services. I'll

                    Forums report that Crowdstrike has issued an advisory with a
                    URL that includes the text
                    "Tech-Alert-Windows-crashes-related-to-Falcon-Sensor-2024-07-19"
                    – but it's behind a regwall that only customers can access.

                    An apparent screenshot of that article reads "CrowdStrike is
                    aware of reports of crashes on Windows hosts related to the
                    Falcon Sensor. Symptoms include hosts experiencing a
                    bugcheck\blue screen error related to the Falcon Sensor."

                  <p>CrowdStrike's engineers are working on the issue.</p>
                  <p>
                    Falcon Sensor is an agent that CrowdStrike claims "blocks
                    attacks on your systems while capturing and recording
                    activity as it happens to detect threats fast."

                  <p>
                    Right now, however, the sensor appears to be the threat.

                    [PDF] in a lawsuit, filed in federal court in Virginia, USA,
                    that GoDaddy initially embraced the success of Entri Connect
                    before abruptly reversing course in favor of forcing folks
                    to use GoDaddy's own DNS record update tool Domain Connect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Shortly after Entri Connect's launch, GoDaddy saw the value
                    of Entri Connect and the two companies entered a partnership
                    together," Entri's lawyers said in the complaint, submitted
                    this month. "But as Entri grew in popularity, GoDaddy saw an
                    opportunity to use its tremendous size to its advantage."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Entri alleges that GoDaddy changed its stance on the
                    partnership late last year, first telling customers that
                    <a href="https://www.entri.com/products/connect"
                      >Entri Connect</a
                    >
                    could no longer be used to update GoDaddy-registered
                    domains, and then updating its terms of use to block Entri
                    from updating DNS settings. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    GoDaddy also "implemented a series of technological measures
                    designed to cause Entri Connect to malfunction when used by
                    GoDaddy customers," the suit alleges. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In place of Entri Connect, GoDaddy pushed its own Domain
                    Connect, which Entri alleges is far less sophisticated and
                    easy to use than its own tool. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "While the Domain Connect protocol may currently be used to
                    update DNS records with only four DNS providers actively
                    using the protocol, Entri Connect may be used with more than
                    forty," Entri said in the suit. The company also alleged
                    that a GoDaddy representative admitted that "third-party
                    software applications preferred to offer their end users
                    Entri Connect over Domain Connect 80 percent of the time." 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Entri began life in 2021 - well after Domain Connect was
                    initiated by GoDaddy. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All of those allegations, says Entri, add up to GoDaddy
                    abusing its market power to disadvantage a competitor, which
                    it says is a violation of America's Sherman Antitrust Act. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Customers of GoDaddy's domain registration services are
                    being improperly denied access to the full suite of choices
                    when it comes to automated domain configuration," Entri
                    argued, adding that it has lost sales, configuration volume,
                    and revenue as a result of GoDaddy's move. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Entri further alleges that GoDaddy has accused it of
                    breaking the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by accessing the
                    registrar's systems, violated GoDaddy's API terms of use,
                    and committed a violation of US trademark law. Along with
                    standard requests for injunctive and monetary relief, Entri
                    is asking a jury to declare it hasn't committed any of that
                    wrongdoing. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    GoDaddy told us it doesn't comment on pending litigation,

                    The Federal Trade Commission has sent letters to eight
                    companies, including leading makers of PC gaming rigs,
                    warning them that their warranty language is a violation of
                    the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (MMWA).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a statement July 3rd, the Federal Trade Commission staff
                    said statements that customers were required use authorized
                    service providers or manufacturer supplied parts or risk
                    voiding their warranty "may be standing in the way of
                    consumers' right to repair products they have purchased."
                    These "warning letters put companies on notice that
                    restricting consumers' right to repair violates the law,"
                    said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer

                    Requiring consumers to use specified parts or service
                    providers to keep their warranties intact is prohibited
                    under the MMWA, unless warrantors provide the parts or
                    services for free or receive a waiver from the FTC. The
                    agency also warned that such statements may be considered
                    deceptive business practices under the FTC Act. Letters

                    In recent years the FTC has increased its scrutiny of
                    companies warranty-related practices and re-exerted its
                    authority to enforce laws like MMWA and other federal laws.
                    It issued similar warnings to six companies in 2018
                    regarding MMWA violations. A

                    by PIRG of 50 home appliance makers that same year found
                    that "the overwhelming majority (45) would void warranties
                    due to independent or self-repair." Then, in 2022,

                    Weber to take multiple steps to correct violations of the
                    MMWA including to cease telling consumers that their
                    warranties will be void if they use third-party services or
                    parts, or that they should only use branded parts or
                    authorized service providers. The FTC said it would seek
                    civil penalties of up to $46,517 per violation in federal
                    court.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The agency has also appealed to the public and businesses
                    for stories of manufacturers forcing consumers to use
                    authorized repair providers and threatening to void
                    warranties for those that don't. The Commission has set up
                    a <a href="https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/?TC=RightToRepair"

                    Kryptonite Panda, GINGHAM TYPHOON, Leviathan and Bronze

                    describes APT40 as a "state-sponsored cyber group" and the
                    People's Republic of China (PRC) as that sponsor. The
                    agencies that authored the advisory – which come from
                    Australia, the US, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea,
                    the UK, and Germany – believe APT40 "conducts malicious

                  <p>
                    [...] The advisory is the result, and suggests that APT40
                    "possesses the capability to rapidly transform and adapt
                    exploit proof-of-concept(s) (POCs) of new vulnerabilities
                    and immediately utilize them against target networks
                    possessing the infrastructure of the associated
                    vulnerability." The gang also watches networks of interest
                    to look for unpatched targets.

                  <p>
                    "This regular reconnaissance postures the group to identify
                    vulnerable, end-of-life or no longer maintained devices on
                    networks of interest, and to rapidly deploy exploits," the
                    advisory warns.

                  <p>
                    Those efforts yield results, because some systems have not

                    [...] "APT40 has embraced the global trend of using
                    compromised devices, including small-office/home-office
                    (SOHO) devices, as operational infrastructure and last-hop
                    redirectors for its operations in Australia," the advisory
                    observes. "Many of these SOHO devices are end-of-life or
                    unpatched and offer a soft target for N-day exploitation."

                    [...] The advisory outlines mitigation tactics that are said
                    to offer decent defences against APT40. They're not rocket
                    science: logging, patch management, and network segmentation
                    are all listed.

                    So are multifactor authentication, disabling unused network
                    services, use of web application firewalls, least privilege
                    access, and replacement of end-of-life equipment.

                    [...] For microwave radiation from a space-based solar power
                    installation, "the only known effect of those frequencies on
                    humans or living things is tissue heating," Vijendran said.
                    "If you were to stand in such a beam at that power level, it
                    would be like standing in the... evening sun." Still, Caplin
                    said that more research is needed to study the effects of
                    these microwaves on humans, animals, plants, satellites,
                    infrastructure, and the ionosphere.

                  <p>
                    Getting that across to the public may remain a challenge,
                    however. "There's still a public perception issue to work
                    through, and it's going to need strong engagement to bring
                    this to market successfully," Adlen said.<br />[...]<br />Vijendran
                    said he expects the cost of space-based solar power will
                    eventually fall to a point where it is competitive with
                    solar and wind power on Earth, which is below $50 per
                    megawatt-hour. According to the Energy Information
                    Administration's 2022
                    <a
                      href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf"
                      >publication</a
                    >
                    on this subject, both solar power and onshore wind cost
                    around $20–$45 per megawatt-hour in 2021.<br />[...]<br />"The
                    first major decision point would be to implement a...
                    small-scale in-space demo mission for launch sometime around
                    2030," Vijendran said.

                    Outside of the ESA, Caltech has
                    <a href="https://www.spacesolar.caltech.edu/"
                      >demonstrated a lightweight prototype</a
                    >
                    that converts sunlight to radio-frequency electrical power
                    and transmits it as a beam. The university has been
                    researching modular, foldable, ultralight space-based solar
                    power equipment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "My view is that much like the world of connectivity went
                    from wired to wireless, so we're going to see the world of
                    power move in a similar direction," Adlen said.
                    International cooperation will be key to creating
                    space-based solar power stations if projects like these move
                    forward.
