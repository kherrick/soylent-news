                <div>
                  <p>
                    German air-taxi developer Lilium said on Thursday two of its
                    subsidiaries in the country have decided to file for
                    insolvency following unsuccessful talks with state and
                    federal governments to solve its cash crisis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company's U.S.-listed shares fell 57% to 23 cents after
                    the subsidiaries - Lilium GmbH and Lilium eAircraft GmbH -
                    told the parent they are over-indebted and will be unable to
                    pay debts over the coming days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lilium is now "reviewing whether there are grounds for its
                    own insolvency as well," it said in a regulatory filing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company, among a handful of air-taxi makers that are
                    seeking to upend urban travel, was staring at a cash crunch
                    as it is still developing aircraft that is yet to receive
                    approval to carry passengers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lilium had asked the German federal government to guarantee
                    50 million euros ($54 million) of a contemplated 100 million
                    euro convertible loan from KfW, the German state-owned
                    development bank.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the company received indications that the federal
                    government would not approve it, Lilium said. Talks with
                    Bavaria, where Lilium is based, for guarantee of at least 50
                    million euros have not yielded an agreement so far.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The filing for insolvency in Germany could result in the
                    company's ordinary shares being delisted from the Nasdaq, or
                    having its shares suspended, Lilium said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Founded in 2015, Lilium is targeting the regional transport
                    market with a 250 kilometer-range (155 miles) jet that can
                    carry up to six passengers, unlike many rivals which are
                    mainly looking at shorter trips between cities and suburbs.

                    A long-lost story from Bram Stoker, the Irish author of one
                    of the world's best known gothic horror stories 'Dracula',
                    has been found in Dublin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a remarkable discovery, the short story by Stoker, has
                    been unearthed 130 years after it was first printed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The haunting tale, titled 'Gibbet Hill', was found in the
                    1890 Christmas supplement of the Dublin Daily Express.

              <p>It's almost as if Halloween was upon us soon ... oh right.</p>
              <p>
                If it was printed, and then forgotten about (or lost) for 130
                years. How good can it really be? This is around the time he
                also wrote 'Dracula'. Considering it was a bit of a hit it seems
                odd that his other writing was then lost. Did they work contrary
                to how writers work today that if they make one hit then all
                their other writings become "gold" and are reprinted or
                rereleased etc etc.

                    [...] this new twist belongs to one county in Texas, which
                    has given certain people the power to unilaterally decide
                    what is or isn't factual.
                  </p>
                  <ul>

                      <p>
                        [A] decision made this month in a county near Houston
                        left us stunned. The Montgomery County Commissioners
                        Court ordered librarians there to reclassify the
                        nonfiction children's book "Colonization and the
                        Wampanoag Story" as fiction.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        This reclassification decision is a consequence of a
                        contentious policy change in March. Right-wing activists
                        pressured the Montgomery County Commissioners Court to
                        remove librarians from the review process for challenged
                        children's, young adult and parenting books.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        [...] Shortly thereafter, the newly formed Montgomery
                        County "Citizens Review Committee" reclassified
                        "Colonization and the Wampanoag Story" as fiction. The
                        committee reviewed the book in a closed meeting — all
                        its meetings are closed to the public — and it offered
                        no explanation for its decision. The new policy does not
                        allow decisions made by the Citizens Review Committee to
                        be appealed.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    That's how you start erasing your own history. You take the
                    librarians out of the equation. Next, you remove the public
                    from the conversation by making these discussions private.
                    Then you give only the citizens you want to hear from —
                    including any non-residents who want to challenge content
                    they don't like — the only invitation to the discussion: the
                    blanket permission to challenge books and/or their
                    classifications. Then you seal it with a court order and
                    pretend this is just citizens protecting each other, rather
                    than the government engaging in censorship on behalf of
                    people who love censorship as long as it only silences the
                    people they don't like.

                    The challenges don't stop there. Hertz's heavy debt load is
                    tying its hands, potentially forcing the company to navigate
                    choppy waters without the lifeline of share buybacks. With
                    used-vehicle prices on shaky ground and high refinancing
                    costs, Hertz is bracing for more cash outflows. Throw in a
                    recent adverse court ruling that resurrected litigation
                    risks from its bankruptcy, and the financial landscape looks
                    even more daunting. The path to stability isn't just steep;
                    it's laden with obstacles.

                    But it's not just China making moves. The US semiconductor
                    industry, propped up by the Inflation Reduction Act, saw its
                    own patent filings rise by 9 percent, reaching 21,269 in
                    2023-24. With US policies pouring cash into domestic chip
                    production – TSMC's Arizona plant being one high-profile
                    example – the US is keen to keep its supply chain fortified
                    while ramping up its R&amp;D efforts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's not clear whether the current patent push will result
                    in feature parity or processor independence for China in the
                    next several years. Both the US and China are seeking to
                    bring fabrication of sub-10nm nodes to their own turf, and
                    the US Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) predicted in
                    a report out earlier this year that the US would be a bigger
                    winner by far. SIA
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/08/us_china_sia/"
                      >predicted</a
                    >
                    that by 2032, the US would produce 28 percent of the world's
                    advanced processors, compared to just 2 percent from China.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    China's patent surge isn't solely driven by geopolitics. The
                    rise of AI, and particularly the explosion of generative AI,
                    has sparked a push to innovate in semiconductor design. AI
                    accelerators and high-performance chips are hot commodities,
                    and chipmakers everywhere are scrambling to file patents for
                    the next big thing in AI hardware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So while global semiconductor patents are on the rise,
                    China's 42 percent leap is an indication that it's gunning
                    for self-sufficiency. But as the US shores up its own
                    chipmaking prowess, the race is on – and it's only set to
                    intensify if current trends are anything to go by. ®

                About a dozen developers based in Russia have been removed in a

                Controversial Linux VLogger Bryan Lunduke reports that this has
                happened due to US presidential executive order 14071, which
                sanctions IT collaborations with Russian residents (<a

                Linus himself backed the actions, The Register quotes him with
                "I'm Finnish. Did you think I'd be *supporting* Russian
                aggression?"

                This will likely have far reaching consequences, going vastly
                beyond the Linux kernel, with any FLOSS organization in the US
                or under direct US influence having to ban Russian contributors
                before the end of the year.

                    [...] <br />The main evidence presented by Hoback in support
                    of the theory that Todd created Bitcoin is a forum thread
                    from December 2010 in which Todd appears to be "finishing
                    Satoshi's sentences," as Hoback puts it. The topic of that
                    thread—a way to prioritize transactions based on the fee
                    paid—is something Todd would later go on to build into
                    Bitcoin as a contributing developer, responding to a request
                    posted by another forum user, John Dillon, whom Hoback
                    alleges to be another of Todd's alter egos.<br />[...]<br />It
                    was Todd's reaction to being confronted with the theory that
                    ultimately solidified Hoback's conviction in the conclusion
                    he had reached. "The end scene is really about his body
                    language—his expressions. Were you ever caught in a lie?
                    That's what Peter's reaction reads like to me," says
                    Hoback.<br />[...]<br />"[Todd] throws so much shit at the
                    wall that nothing sticks," alleges Hoback. "It's a pretty
                    effective technique—it's hard to pin down someone who's a
                    contrarian and constantly makes opposite statements." (Todd
                    rejects Hoback's assessment as "wooly conspiracy
                    thinking.")<br />[...]<br />"If you assume a sophisticated
                    enough Satoshi, practically any theory is possible," says
                    Todd. "It's a useless question, because Satoshi would simply
                    deny it."

                    Police use of automated license-plate reader cameras is
                    being challenged in a lawsuit alleging that the cameras
                    enable warrantless surveillance in violation of the Fourth
                    Amendment. The city of Norfolk, Virginia, was sued yesterday
                    by plaintiffs represented by the Institute for Justice, a
                    nonprofit public-interest law firm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Norfolk, a city with about 238,000 residents, "has installed
                    a network of cameras that make it functionally impossible
                    for people to drive anywhere without having their movements
                    tracked, photographed, and stored in an AI-assisted database
                    that enables the warrantless surveillance of their every
                    move. This civil rights lawsuit seeks to end this dragnet
                    surveillance program," said the complaint filed in US
                    District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like many other cities, Norfolk uses cameras made by the
                    company Flock Safety. A 404 Media article said Institute for
                    Justice lawyer Robert Frommer "told 404 Media that the
                    lawsuit could have easily been filed in any of the more than
                    5,000 communities where Flock is active, but that Norfolk
                    made sense because the Fourth Circuit of Appeals—which
                    Norfolk is part of—recently held that persistent,
                    warrantless drone surveillance in Baltimore is
                    unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment in a case called
                    Beautiful Struggle v Baltimore Police Department."

                    >. Because of significant differences in biology, not the
                    least of which is the generation time of Proboscideans,
                    these other efforts may reach many critical milestones well
                    in advance of the work on mammoths.<br />[...]<br />Colossal
                    has branched out from its original de-extinction mission to
                    include efforts to keep species from ever needing its
                    services. In the case of marsupial predators, the
                    de-extinction effort is incorporating work that will benefit
                    existing marsupial predators: generating resistance to the
                    toxins found on the cane toad, an invasive species that has
                    spread widely across Australia.<br />[...]<br />For the
                    de-extinction process, the goal would be to ensure that the
                    thylacine could survive in the presence of the cane toad.
                    But Colossal has also begun a conservation effort, called
                    the Colossal foundation, that aims to keep threatened
                    species from needing its services in the future.<br />[...]<br />Colossal
                    has obtained a nearly complete genome sequence from a
                    thylacine sample that was preserved in ethanol a bit over a
                    century ago. According to Pask, this sample contains both
                    the short fragments typical of older DNA samples (typically
                    just a few hundred base pairs long), but also some DNA
                    molecules that were above 10,000 bases long. This allowed
                    them to do both short- and long-read sequencing, leaving
                    them with just 45 gaps in the total genome sequence, which
                    the team expects to close shortly.<br />[...]<br />The final
                    thing the company announced was that it was working on
                    getting dunnart embryos to develop outside of the womb.<br />[...]<br />At
                    this point, they've got immature neural cells and have
                    started forming the cells that will go on to form muscles
                    and the vertebrae. But many critical events need to happen
                    in the remaining one-third of the pregnancy, and Colossal
                    isn't ready to talk about what goes wrong to stop
                    development here.<br />[...]<br />Hopefully, over time, the
                    company will continue to submit some of its work to
                    peer-reviewed journals.

                    In the meantime, the clear indications of progress suggest
                    that some of the unique features of the
                    marsupials—relatively rapid generation times, accessible
                    reproductive system, and many similarities to well-studied
                    placental mammals—are helping this project move ahead at a
                    reasonably rapid clip.

                    — a task that quantum computers can do that a classical one
                    would struggle with. Usually, researchers understand quantum
                    advantage to mean that a quantum computer can do the task in
                    far fewer steps.

                    The new papers show that quantum memory lets a quantum
                    computer perform a task not necessarily with fewer steps,
                    but with less data. As a result, researchers believe this in
                    itself could be a way to prove quantum advantage. “It allows
                    us to, in the more near term, already achieve that kind of
                    quantum advantage,” said

                    But researchers are excited about the practical benefits
                    too, as the new results make it easier for researchers to
                    understand complex quantum systems.

                    was confirmed to one customer after they filed a complaint
                    through customer support.

                    Smart devices have long worried security experts and users
                    for their potential vulnerabilities. In August, cyber
                    security researchers uncovered multiple vulnerabilities in
                    Ecovacs products (including lawn mowers) that could allow
                    hackers to take control of microphones and cameras via
                    mobile Bluetooth connections — to put it simply, researchers
                    concluded the company's security was "really, really,
                    really, really bad."

                    Design elements intended to protect users, like an audio
                    alert that lets individuals know the vacuum's camera is on,
                    could be easily switched off.

                    Intel had a solution ready to add 64-bit features to the
                    "classic" 32-bit x86 ISA, but the company chose to push
                    forward with the Itanium operation instead. A new snippet of
                    technology history has recently emerged from a year-old

                    the history behind the x86-64 transition, when he discovered
                    the conversation. Colwell revealed that Intel had an
                    inactive internal version of the x86-64 ISA embedded in
                    Pentium 4 chips. The company's management forced the
                    engineering team to "fuse off" the features.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The functionality was there, but users could not access it.
                    Intel decided to focus on the 64-bit native architecture
                    developed for Itanium instead of x86-64. The company felt
                    that a 64-bit Pentium 4 would have damaged Itanium's chances
                    to win the PC market. Management allegedly told Colwell "not
                    once, but twice" to stop going on about 64-bits on x86 if he
                    wanted to keep his job.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The engineer decided to compromise, leaving the logic gates
                    related to x86-64 features "hidden" in the hardware design.
                    Colwell bet that Intel would need to chase after AMD and
                    quickly implement its version of the x86-64 ISA, and he was
                    right. Itanium CPUs had no native backward compatibility
                    with 16-bit and 32-bit x86 software, so the architecture was
                    one of the worst commercial (and technology)

                    [...] Bob Colwell made significant contributions to Intel's
                    history, managing the development of popular PC CPUs such as
                    Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, and Pentium 4 before
                    retiring in 2000. Meanwhile, today's x86 chips marketed by

                    A new concept from Hyundai's parts division, Hyundai Mobis,
                    developed in partnership with optics specialists Zeiss, aims
                    to transform your entire windshield into one massive
                    display. Dubbed the "Holographic Windshield Display," it
                    takes the modest head-up displays we've seen for decades and
                    dramatically expands their scope.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rather than just projecting basic information like speed or
                    turn-based directions onto a small part of the windshield,
                    this system envisions menus, apps, videos, and even games
                    spanning the full width of the glass in front of you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the concept render shown, there's no central touchscreen
                    – everything is displayed on the windshield. This suggests
                    that voice and gesture controls will likely be the primary
                    input methods, since you can't exactly reach out and touch
                    your windshield.

                    the technology as "navigation and driving information
                    unfolding like a panorama across the wide, transparent
                    windshield" in its press release. Meanwhile, passengers
                    could watch movies or video call friends, who appear as
                    holograms on the glass.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To prevent distractions, what's displayed to the driver
                    would differ from what passengers see. For example, the
                    driver may only see directions and essential info, while
                    passengers could binge-watch their favorite shows.

                    Last week, the California Coastal Commission rejected a plan
                    for SpaceX to launch up to 50 rockets this year at the
                    Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County. The
                    company responded yesterday with a lawsuit, alleging that
                    the state agency's denial was overreaching its authority and
                    discriminating against its CEO.

                  <p>
                    The Commission's goal is to protect California's coasts and
                    beaches, as well as the animals living in them. The agency
                    has control over private companies' requests to use the
                    state coastline, but it can't deny activities by federal
                    departments. The denied launch request was actually made by
                    the US Space Force on behalf of SpaceX, asking that the
                    company be allowed to launch 50 of its Falcon 9 rockets, up
                    from 36.

                    about SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's political screed and the spotty
                    safety records at his companies during their review of the
                    launch request, the assessment focused on the relationship
                    between SpaceX and Space Force. The Space Force case is that
                    "because it is a customer of — and reliant on — SpaceX’s
                    launches and satellite network, SpaceX launches are a
                    federal agency activity," the Commission

                    stated. "However, this does not align with how federal
                    agency activities are defined in the Coastal Zone Management
                    Act’s regulations or the manner in the Commission has
                    historically implemented those regulations." The California
                    Coastal Commission claimed that at least 80 percent of the
                    SpaceX rockets contain payloads for Musk's Starlink company
                    rather than payloads for government clients.

                    As Intel struggles with a falling stock price and revenue

                    >, Qualcomm has decided to wait until after the election
                    before deciding its next move. Such a massive deal would
                    undoubtedly face intense scrutiny from regulators, both
                    domestic and globally. The company wants to see how the next
                    administration's policies affect factors that could impact
                    the acquisition, such as antitrust rules and US-China
                    relations.

                  <p>
                    China is an important market for both Qualcomm and Intel. In
                    the same month that it first approached Intel, Qualcomm met
                    with antitrust regulators in China to gauge any potential
                    response to the deal. The company hasn't received any
                    feedback from Chinese authorities, who are apparently
                    waiting to see if Qualcomm makes a formal offer for Intel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the US, where Intel is the key player in the government's
                    plan to reignite the country's domestic chip manufacturing
                    industry, White House support for the deal would be crucial.

                    Intel is set to become the biggest beneficiary of the Chips
                    act, receiving $8.5 billion in grants as well as $11 billion
                    in low-interest loans, provided it proceeds with its factory
                    construction plans. It's been six months since the
                    government announced the award and Intel is still

                    for the funding. Qualcomm has been in discussions with US
                    regulators and believes that an all-American merger could
                    alleviate any concerns, according to the report.

                    "Factoring a 50-bit number using a hybrid quantum-classical
                    approach is a far cry from breaking 'military-grade

                    While advancements have indeed been made, the progress
                    represents incremental steps rather than a paradigm-shifting
                    breakthrough that renders current cryptographic systems
                    obsolete.

                    "This kind of overstatement does more harm than good," Dr.
                    Garcell said. "Misrepresenting current capabilities as
                    'breaking military-grade encryption' is not just
                    inaccurate—it's potentially damaging to the field's

                    The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) has
                    discovered the largest known prime number,
                    2<sup>136,279,841</sup>-1, having 41,024,320 decimal digits.
                    Luke Durant, from San Jose, California, found the prime on
                    October 12th.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new prime number, also known as M136279841, is
                    calculated by multiplying together 136,279,841 twos, and
                    then subtracting 1. It is over 16 million digits larger than
                    the previous record prime number, in a special class of
                    extremely rare prime numbers known as Mersenne primes. It is
                    only the 52nd known Mersenne prime ever discovered, each
                    increasingly more difficult to find. Mersenne primes were
                    named for the French monk Marin Mersenne, who studied these
                    numbers more than 350 years ago. GIMPS, founded in 1996, has
                    discovered the last 18 Mersenne primes. Volunteers download
                    a free program to search for these primes, with a $3000
                    award offered to anyone lucky enough to find a new prime.
                    Prof. Chris Caldwell founded an authoritative web site on
                    the largest known primes which is now maintained by
                    volunteers, and has an excellent history of Mersenne primes.

                    If you have ever been on the receiving end of a paper cut,
                    you will know how painful they can be.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To find out why paper is so successful at cutting
                    skin, Jensen and fellow DTU colleagues carried out over 50
                    experiments with a range of paper thicknesses to make
                    incisions into a piece of gelatine at various angles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Through these experiments and modelling,
                    <a
                      href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.110.025003"
                      >they discovered</a
                    >
                    that paper cuts are a competition between slicing and
                    "buckling". Thin paper with a thickness of about 30 microns,
                    or 0.03 mm, doesn't cut so well because it buckles – a
                    mechanical instability that happens when a slender object
                    like paper is compressed. Once this occurs, the paper can no
                    longer transfer force to the tissue, so is unable to cut.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thick paper, with a thickness greater than around 200
                    microns, is also ineffective at making an incision. This is
                    because it distributes the load over a greater area,
                    resulting in only small indentations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team found, however, a paper cut "sweet spot" at around
                    65 microns and when the incision was made at an angle of
                    about 20 degrees from the surface. This paper thickness just
                    happens to be close to that of the paper used in print
                    magazines, which goes some way to explain why it annoyingly
                    happens so often.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] ensen notes that the findings are interesting for two
                    reasons. "First, it's a new case of soft-on-soft
                    interactions where the deformation of two objects
                    intertwines in a non-trivial way," he says. "Traditional
                    metal knives are much stiffer than biological tissues, while
                    paper is still stiffer than skin but around 100 times weaker
                    than steel."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second is that it is a "great way" to teach students
                    about forces given that the experiments are straightforward
                    to do in the classroom. "Studying the physics of paper cuts
                    has revealed a surprising potential use for paper in the
                    digital age: not as a means of information dissemination and
                    storage, but rather as a tool of destruction," the
                    researchers write.

                    a rather insightful glimpse into the rise of mass timber and
                    its benefits. The technique basically uses massive
                    engineered wood elements instead of concrete and steel to
                    build higher than ever before. As of 2024, mass timber
                    buildings have climbed to almost unbelievable heights, with
                    the 25-story Ascent tower in Milwaukee leading the pack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The building is far from the only one in the category. The
                    report states that there were 84 completed or
                    under-construction mass timber buildings of eight stories or
                    higher worldwide by 2022, with another 55 proposed. Europe
                    dominates with 70% of these, but North America is catching
                    up with around 20%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for what's driving this wooden renaissance, there are
                    multiple reasons. For starters, mass timber could be an
                    answer for reducing concrete and steel's massive carbon
                    footprint, which alone makes up a whopping 15% of global
                    emissions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But what about issues like raw strength and fire
                    resistance, which have historically held wooden buildings
                    back? Well, mass timber uses elements like cross-laminated
                    timber (CLT) panels that can match steel's strength
                    pound-for-pound, thanks to layering and high-pressure gluing
                    techniques.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Modern mass timber also passes rigorous fire testing. In the
                    event of a fire, a protective char layer forms on the wood's
                    surface, insulating the interior from flames long enough for
                    evacuation and firefighter response.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Likely taking these perks into account, a 2021 update to the
                    International Building Code gave mass timber a huge vote of
                    confidence, allowing such constructions up to 18 stories in
                    many places.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, moisture poses risks that need careful management
                    to prevent fungus and pests. But proponents are confident
                    mass timber can be a sustainable solution if done right.

                    practices while calling for an investigation into the

                    on its WeChat account on Wednesday described Intel's chips
                    as being riddled with vulnerabilities, adding that the
                    American company's "major defects in product quality and
                    security management show its extremely irresponsible

                    The CSAC also accused Intel of embedding a backdoor "in
                    almost all" of its CPUs since 2008 as part of a
                    "next-generation security defense system" developed by the

                    Tech-savvy or not, I’m sure this is the step when panic
                    starts creeping in. Mitrovic asked the Google support person
                    to send him an email. The voice said he would:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        In the background, I can hear someone typing on the
                        keyboard and throughout the call there is some
                        background noise reminiscent of a call centre.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        He tells me that he has sent the email. After a few
                        moments, the email arrives and at a first glance the
                        email looks legit – the sender is from a Google domain.
                      </p>

                    Thankfully for the IT specialist, he was careful enough to
                    start checking things. While the phone number seemed legit,
                    the email domain looked suspicious. It did not come from a
                    Google server. That’s when he realized he must have been
                    talking to an AI:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The point of the whole thing is for the victim to
                    eventually trust the Google rep and agree to verify their
                    account. They would have probably clicked on a link taking
                    them to a Google-like website. But it would have been a scam
                    website meant to grab the password associated with the email
                    account.

                    Over the past decade, students have become overwhelmed by
                    the reading. College kids have never read everything they're
                    assigned, of course, but this feels different. Dames's
                    students now seem bewildered by the thought of finishing
                    multiple books a semester.

                    It's not that they don't want to do the reading. It's that
                    they don't know how. Middle and high schools have stopped
                    asking them to.

                    Twenty years ago, Dames's classes had no problem engaging in
                    sophisticated discussions of Pride and Prejudice one week
                    and Crime and Punishment the next. Now his students tell him
                    up front that the reading load feels impossible. It's not
                    just the frenetic pace; they struggle to attend to small
                    details while keeping track of the overall plot.

                    Failing to complete a 14-line poem without succumbing to

                Students at elite collages(sic) such as Columbia can't read
                books anymore. It's not that they can't read but they can
                apparently only read short texts in short bursts of time. Their
                attention span have been ruined by smartphones, modern
                technology and a few decades of modern teaching methods that
                prioritize small texts.
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes it extra bad is that these are apparently students
                that are taking courses in literature. These should be the avid
                readers. I guess we'll see more college books with large text,
                more pictures and being "for dummies" (it used to be a joke, not
                anymore I guess).

                    involved participants utilizing specialized equipment
                    including sensors and earbuds. On September 24, one
                    participant sleeping at home induced lucid dreaming, a state
                    in which you are aware that you are dreaming. It is
                    apparently a trainable skill, although I have only ever
                    personally experienced it a handful of times throughout my
                    life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the night of the 24th when the REMspace participant
                    entered this state, the connected hardware they were wearing
                    pinged a remote server that generated a random Remmyo word
                    (<a href="https://remspace.net/remmyo/">Remmyo</a> is a type
                    of dream language that is detectable using sensors). The
                    word was sent to the earbuds the person was wearing, and
                    they repeated it in their dream.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The dreamer's response – the Remmyo word – was then captured
                    and stored on the server. Eight minutes later, another
                    participant entered a lucid dream and received the stored
                    message from the first user. When she woke, she confirmed
                    the word – successfully demonstrating the first-ever "chat"
                    exchange between two dreaming participants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    REMspace said two other participants were also able to
                    communicate with its server while dreaming.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The startup's founder and CEO, Michael Raduga, said
                    communicating in dreams seemed like science fiction
                    yesterday. "Tomorrow, it will be so common we won't be able
                    to imagine our lives without this technology," the executive
                    added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Raduga said the capability opens the door to countless
                    commercial applications, but stopped short of giving any
                    specific examples. "We believe that REM sleep and related
                    phenomena, like lucid dreams, will become the next big
                    industry after AI," he noted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While no doubt fascinating, it is also a bit frightening.
                    The idea of commercializing dreams sounds ripe for misuse
                    and if we're being force-fed content even while we are
                    sleeping, when will we ever be able to truly unplug and get
                    any actual rest?

                It is a long time since we issued a Meta regarding the situation
                of the site. Much has been happening, but nowhere near as
                quickly as we had imagined or had hoped. But we are now almost
                there.

                The handover of assets is taking place. The new Board has been
                instrumental in this and, when the transfer is finally complete,
                I know that NCommander wishes to write his own Meta to you, the
                community. Details of who is in which seat will happen once the
                handover is complete because, until that point, the current site
                is the one that has existed since 2014, and it is still headed
                by NCommander.
              </p>
              <p>
                New hardware is being set up which will allow us to drastically
                reduce the running costs of the site. Two people, fliptop and
                kolie, have donated the use of servers and internet connections
                free of charge to SoylentNews. This is an extremely generous
                donation on their part and one for which the new Board is
                extremely grateful. Contracts, where requested, are being
                actioned as I write this Meta. There will still be annual costs
                for domains etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                The new hardware will have a new software structure installed on
                it, based on Docker containers. These will provide a
                significantly easier system to manage and, hopefully, will also
                take care automatically with many of the disruptive issues that
                we have seen in recent months. I do not claim that there will
                not be any initial hiccups but the site will still be running on
                Rehash and will look and behave exactly as it does today. There
                will be issues regarding updates to software for which new
                procedures will have to be produced and documented, but that is
                a task for the future and it need not delay the transfer.
              </p>

                Regarding changes to software, there is an incident that took
                place last weekend. A community member informed us that the
                moderation system, under certain usages, could compromise the
                identity of both the moderator and the moderatee. I passed the
                information to NCommander and kolie who, despite it being a
                weekend, identified and confirmed the problem, and subsequently
                identified a potential fix. The software change was made by
                kolie first thing on (his) Monday morning, which means that a
                serious problem was identified and the fix implemented in a
                fraction over 24 hours. I don't think anyone could have done it
                any faster bearing in mind that this is an all-volunteer site
                and considering that it occurred at a time when most people
                would rather be having some private time with their families.
                The team we have at the moment is much smaller than we have ever
                had before but it is still capable of managing the site and
                keeping the stories flowing. It is only right that I acknowledge
                on your behalf the contribution made by, and offer my thanks to,
                the community member who reported the issue (who may identify
                themself if they wish), NCommander and in particular kolie, who
                is very much involved in the new site just as he has been for
                the last 18 months or so.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, not all problems are under our control. The current
                issues with IRC have resulted in a ticket being raised by
                NCommander for support action to be taken by Akamai/Linode. The
                problem occurred immediately after some routine maintenance, and
                it appears to be related to DNS and IPv6 as a result of changes
                that have been introduced by that maintenance. I do not have all
                the details to hand but it is being actioned.
              </p>
              <p>
                For this site to remain active and interesting we rely on
                community support. Whether that be by making submissions (you
                should know the sort of topics that we are looking for, and we
                can always put some things under the 'random' topic), or by
                offering to assist with one of the teams, or just by commenting
                as many of you are doing now. I realise that this is an
                important time in the run-up to an election but please discuss
                TFA and not bring politics into every discussion. You can
                discuss politics as much as you wish in your journals. In fact,
                there is no 'politics' topic, nor has there ever been one.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have been asked numerous times when will ACs be allowed back
                onto the front pages? There is only one person stopping that
                from happening now, and it is not me. There will always be
                occasional spamming and that can be managed quite effectively by
                community moderation. When the excessive spamming and abuse
                stops for good then ACs can return to full discussions. But
                spamming will not result in closing down this site.

                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment"
                  >Stanford Prison Experiment</a
                >" that was intended to examine the psychological experiences of
                imprisonment, has died. In the 1971 prison study funded by the
                US Office of Naval Research, Zimbardo and a team of graduate
                students recruited male college students to spend two weeks in a
                mock prison in the basement of a building on the Stanford
                campus. The United States Navy and the United States Marine
                Corps wanted to understand anti-social behavior and investigate
                conflict between military guards and prisoners. After
                psychologist
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Maslach"
                  >Christina Maslach</a
                >
                (later to become his wife) visited to evaluate the conditions,
                she was troubled to see how study participants were behaving and
                she confronted Zimbardo. He ended the experiment on the sixth
                day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Selected student participants were assigned randomly to be
                "prisoners" or "guards" in a mock prison located in the basement
                of the psychology building at Stanford. Prisoners were confined
                to a 6 by 9 feet cell with black steel-barred doors. The only
                furniture in each cell was a cot. Solitary confinement was a
                small unlit closet. In his book Humankind - a hopeful history
                (2020) historian
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutger_Bregman/"
                  >Rutger Bregman</a
                >
                discusses charges that the whole experiment was faked and
                fraudulent; Bregman argued this experiment is often used as an
                example to show that people succumb easily to evil behavior, but
                Zimbardo was less than candid about the fact that he told the
                guards to act the way they did.
              </p>
              <p>
                Zimbardo's primary reason for conducting the experiment was to
                focus on the power of roles, rules, symbols, group identity and
                situational validation of behavior that generally would repulse
                ordinary individuals. "I had been conducting research for some
                years on deindividuation, vandalism and dehumanization that
                illustrated the ease with which ordinary people could be led to
                engage in anti-social acts by putting them in situations where
                they felt anonymous, or they could perceive of others in ways
                that made them less than human, as enemies or objects," said
                Zimbardo.

                    The Commission will determine its next steps following an
                    assessment of Temu’s response, which could result in a
                    formal investigation into the company. Under the DSA, the EU
                    can impose fines for incorrect, incomplete or misleading
                    information in response to an RFI. If Temu does not respond
                    by the deadline, it could also face periodic penalty
                    payments.

                    A newly formed group of UK electronics companies is
                    advocating for the removal of VAT (value-added tax) on
                    electronic spare parts, repairs, and labor in the
                    government's upcoming autumn budget, claiming this would
                    encourage consumers to get kit repaired instead of replacing
                    it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The group, which calls itself CLEAR (Circular Leadership for
                    Electronics and Recycling), says it aims to address the
                    growing issue of electronic waste and the barriers
                    preventing consumers from repairing rather than replacing
                    electrical items.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Members of the group include consumer brands such as
                    ProCook, Positec Power Tools Europe, Glen Dimplex Home
                    Appliances, and Melitta, while the group is chaired by James
                    Rigg, chief exec of
                    <a href="https://trojanelectronics.co.uk/"
                      >Trojan Electronics</a
                    >, which provides repair, refurbishment, and resell services
                    as well as contract manufacturing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Rigg, getting rid of VAT charges on electronic
                    repairs is a "crucial step" in creating a more circular
                    economy. However, CLEAR is going further and also lobbying
                    for the British government to follow the example of
                    countries like Austria and France, which have introduced
                    subsidies for electrical repairs.

                    [...] With its killer robots and its rogue AI system,
                    Skynet, The Terminator has become synonymous with the
                    spectre of a machine intelligence that turns against its
                    human creators. Picture editors routinely illustrate
                    articles about AI with the chrome death's head of the film's
                    T-800 "hunter-killer" robot. The roboticist Ronald Arkin
                    used clips from the film in a cautionary 2013 talk called
                    How NOT to build a Terminator.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The layperson is likely to imagine unaligned AI as
                    rebellious and malevolent. But the likes of Nick Bostrom
                    insist that the real danger is from careless programming.
                    Think of the sorcerer's broom in Disney's Fantasia: a device
                    that obediently follows its instructions to ruinous
                    extremes. The second type of AI is not human enough it lacks
                    common sense and moral judgement. The first is too human -
                    selfish, resentful, power-hungry. Both could in theory be
                    genocidal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Terminator therefore both helps and hinders our
                    understanding of AI: what it means for a machine to "think",
                    and how it could go horrifically wrong. Many AI researchers
                    resent the Terminator obsession altogether for exaggerating
                    the existential risk of AI at the expense of more immediate
                    dangers such as mass unemployment, disinformation and
                    autonomous weapons. "First, it makes us worry about things
                    that we probably don't need to fret about," writes Michael
                    Woolridge. "But secondly, it draws attention away from those
                    issues raised by AI that we should be concerned about."

                    “Fish farming is not a substitute for catching wild fish out
                    of the ocean,” says
                    <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/matthew-hayek.html"
                      >Matthew Hayek</a

                    at New York University. “In fact, it relies on catching wild
                    fish out of the ocean.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hayek and his colleagues have shown that the amount of wild

                    Farmed carnivorous fish eat multiple times more weight in

                    than is obtained by farming them, says Hayek. For instance,
                    producing a kilogram of salmon may require 4 or 5 kilograms
                    of wild fish.

                    relying on what occurred in the past when making predictions

                    cyclone impacts in a different way from what might have
                    worked in the past. This includes being prepared for
                    potentially fewer tropical cyclones overall, but with those
                    that do occur being more likely to cause more damage. This
                    means there are higher risks of damaging winds, flooding and
                    coastal erosion.

                    In the aftermath of hurricanes like Helene and Milton, the
                    damaging effects of these natural disasters are the center
                    of national conversations, including questions about the
                    long-term impact to infrastructure. However, current methods
                    for damage assessment don't offer clear and timely answers
                    to these questions.

                  <p>
                    That's where AI and engineering can help. Researchers from
                    Texas A&amp;M University are pioneering the use of AI and
                    machine learning to create faster methods to assess damages
                    caused by hurricanes.

                    [...] Using this dataset, Manzini and fellow graduate
                    student Priya Perali trained an AI system to recognize
                    building and road damage caused by disasters. Learning these
                    models took hours of high-performance computing but have
                    resulted in a damage assessment system that can sort through
                    the building and road damages of a large neighborhood after
                    a disaster in only four minutes using a laptop.

                    "AI offers tremendous value for rural counties which do not
                    have the budget or workforce to conduct physical damage
                    assessments but do have inexpensive drones," said Murphy, a

                    Mark Zuckerberg's Meta has sacked a number of staff after
                    they abused the company's $25 (£19) meal scheme to order
                    household goods such as toothpaste and washing powder.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Almost 30 staff in the company's Los Angeles office were
                    dismissed after they were found to be routinely using
                    takeaway credits to order groceries and cosmetics, employees
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The sackings included high-paid engineers earning six-figure
                    salaries, according to posts on the anonymous chat app
                    Blind.

                    Meta, which is currently worth $1.5 trillion, provides staff
                    with free breakfast, lunch and dinner at its larger offices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those in smaller offices without staff canteens instead
                    receive vouchers for delivery apps such as Grubhub, which
                    they can use to order food when working at the office.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, Meta recently discovered that some employees were
                    using the $25 vouchers to order household items from stores
                    that feature on the apps.

                  <p>
                    In some cases, staff were using the scheme to buy wine
                    glasses and laundry detergent, according to the Financial
                    Times.

                    The school, however, is fighting back with a

                    [PDF] the case. The school argues that RNH, along with his
                    classmates, was given a copy of the student handbook in the
                    Fall of last year, which specifically called out the use of
                    AI by students. The class was also shown a presentation
                    about the school's policy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Students should "not use AI tools during in-class
                    examinations, processed writing assignments, homework or
                    classwork unless explicitly permitted and instructed," the
                    policy states.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "RNH unequivocally used another author’s language and
                    thoughts, be it a digital and artificial author, without
                    express permission to do so," the school argues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Furthermore, he did not cite to his use of AI in his notes,
                    scripts or in the project he submitted. Importantly, RNH’s
                    peers were not allowed to cut corners by using AI to craft
                    their projects; thus, RNH acted 'unfairly in order to gain
                    an advantage.'"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unless the school and parents reach a settlement, the case
                    will go to court later this month.

                    The FCC is considering taking action on ISP data caps under

                    of the Communications Act, which gives the FCC the right to
                    eliminate market barriers for small businesses in acquiring
                    or using telecommunications and information services.

                    "We also seek comment generally on our ability to rely on
                    other sources of statutory authority within the Act for
                    potential actions related to data cap practices," the FCC
                    noted. Additionally, the Commission said it's examining
                    whether there are any barriers – like the First Amendment –
                    that could hamper its actions.

                  <p>
                    We approached the FCC (which didn't respond) as well as
                    multiple ISPs, to ask about the Commission's proposal. Those
                    who answered directed us to telecommunications industry

                    CTIA, the wireless industry association, said: "Wireless
                    providers maintain robust networks and offer a wide range of
                    broadband service plans that enable consumers to choose what
                    best suits their unique needs and budgets. American
                    consumers used over 100 trillion megabytes in wireless data
                    last year, and thanks to the highly competitive wireless
                    industry, they are paying less for their service, including
                    unlimited data plans that are more than 40 percent cheaper
                    than in 2010. While many consumers choose unlimited plans,
                    usage-based pricing plans give cost-conscious customers
                    options and make it possible to offer Lifeline-supported
                    mobile plans at no cost to eligible consumers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A USTelecom spokesperson commented: "Providers offer an
                    incredibly wide range of choices to empower consumers to
                    select the plans that best meet their individual needs.
                    Consumers should continue to be in the driver's seat when
                    making these choices, not government."

                While in this case it's specifically about DATEL selling their
                various cheating devices. But it also kind of seems like the
                Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) just made some
                versions of cracking software protections legal. As long as you
                leave the code alone in the executables and only do changes in
                RAM then it's all fine and dandy. So for example having another
                program that just patches part of the RAM while running or
                executing the code in RAM. It's not really harder to patch in
                more lives, infinite gold or just not checking for various
                protection mechanisms. Either removing them or just flipping
                some bits to everything is alright. Protection check passed. No
                copyright there.

                reports: James Howells has spent more than a decade trying to

                lawyers to sue the council he claims has 'ignored' him "I'm
                suing the council for £495m because they won't give me back my

                    A man has filed a court claim against Newport council in a
                    "last resort" to get back almost half a billion pounds'
                    worth of Bitcoin. A mix-up saw James Howells' hard drive
                    dumped at a recycling centre in 2013 causing him to lose
                    access to cryptocurrency coins which have since rocketed in
                    value.

                    WalesOnline has seen a court document that says Mr Howells,
                    39, is suing the council for £495,314,800 in damages, which
                    was the peak valuation of his 8,000 Bitcoins from earlier
                    this year. But he told us this is not a reflection of "what
                    is really going on" and the point is to "leverage" the
                    council into agreeing to an excavation of its landfill to
                    avoid a legal battle. Mr Howells says he has assembled a
                    team of experts who would carry out the £10million dig at no
                    cost to the council. He is also offering the council 10% of
                    the coins' value if recovered.

                    The hard drive disaster unfolded after a miscommunication
                    between the IT engineer and his then-partner. Mr Howells,
                    who learned about Bitcoin in 2009 by spending time on IT
                    forums, believes he was one of the very first miners of the
                    cryptocurrency. In basic terms he created the 8,000 coins
                    himself and they cost him nothing beyond pennies' worth of
                    electricity to run his laptop. He stored the private key
                    needed to access the coins on a 2.5in hard drive which he
                    put in a drawer at his home office.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In August 2013 he had a clearout of equipment. Looking
                    through his drawers he came across two hard drives of the
                    same size. One contained the Bitcoin data while the other
                    was blank. Mistakenly he put the Bitcoin one into a black
                    bin liner. When he went to bed that evening he asked his
                    then-partner if after the school run the next morning she
                    would take that bin bag and another one to Newport household
                    waste recycling centre. "His partner refused and stated that
                    she did not wish to do that," write Mr Howells' team of
                    barristers in the claim.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The claim says Mr Howells was "not overly concerned" by her
                    refusal because he had made a mental note to double-check if
                    he had put the right hard drive in the bin bag. But when he
                    woke at 9am his partner had already returned from the school
                    run and had taken the bin bags to the tip. Mr Howells' lost
                    Bitcoins were worth less than £1m at the time but within
                    three months they had soared to a value of £9m. One day they
                    could be worth billions, Mr Howells believes, citing
                    predictions from asset management firm VanEck.

                    Newport council sent us a statement hitting back at the
                    "weak" court claim and the criticism over its environmental
                    breaches. Its spokesman said: "The council has told Mr
                    Howells multiple times that excavation is not possible under
                    our environmental permit and that work of that nature would
                    have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding

                    There's good earnings news for U.S. members: Salaries are
                    rising. Base salaries increased by about 5 percent from 2022

                    In current dollars, the median income of U.S. engineers and
                    other tech professionals who are IEEE members was US
                    $174,161 last year, up about 5 percent from $169,000 in
                    2022, excluding overtime pay, profit sharing, and other
                    supplemental earnings. Unemployment fell to 1.2 percent in
                    this year's survey, down from 1.4 percent in the previous
                    year.

                  <p>
                    As with prior surveys, earned income is measured for the
                    year preceding the survey's date of record—so the 2024
                    survey reports income earned in 2023.

                  <p>
                    To calculate the median salary, IEEE-USA considered only
                    respondents who were tech professionals working full time in
                    their primary area of competence—a sample of 4,192 people.

                    >—a new extension framework believed to reduce the
                    effectiveness of certain ad blockers—is the underlying cause
                    and is seen as part of Google's big move against ad and
                    tracking blocks. Developer Raymond Hill highlighted this
                    shift by sharing a screenshot depicting Chrome automatically
                    disabling uBlock Origin due to incompatibility with the
                    upcoming regulations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To circumnavigate these limitations, Hill has developed
                    uBlock Origin Lite, which conforms to the Manifest V3
                    guidelines, though it needs to be installed manually
                    because, as Hill points out in a GitHub FAQ, the differences
                    between the original and the Lite versions are too
                    significant for an automatic update.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The essence of a manifest involves defining extension
                    attributes such as name, version, and required permissions.
                    Manifest V3 changes key aspects of this definition, notably
                    removing the ability to execute code from external servers.
                    According to Hill, the newer version of his ad-blocking
                    tool, uBlock Origin Lite, may not perform as robustly as its
                    predecessor due to its diminished filtering capabilities.

                    interference, whereas if they do, her position becomes
                    immediately untenable, and affects the gov[ernment]'s

                    The announcement that John Cena has signed on to be the star
                    of the new Matchbox live-action movie raises a few
                    questions. First—there's going to be a Matchbox movie? And
                    second—what will it be about, exactly?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We know that Cena is a car guy of broad tastes: He owns a
                    couple of classic muscle cars but daily-drives Civic Type-R,
                    and he's of course part of the Fast and Furious franchise of
                    films. He's also the kind of charismatic lead that doesn't
                    mind a bit of fun at his own expense. (His comedic timing
                    probably comes from his days as a professional wrestler.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What's going to be in the script that gets handed to him?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With 2023's Barbie hitting more than $1.4 billion in
                    worldwide box offices, you just know Mattel is looking over
                    its various intellectual properties and imagining a Scrooge
                    McDuck–sized swimming pool of cash. There'll be a Hot Wheels
                    movie at some point, and since that franchise already has
                    spawned multiple video games, it's easy to imagine some kind
                    of film with action-packed racing and huge stunts is in the
                    offing, like a G-rated version of the aforementioned Fast
                    and Furious. Matchbox is different, though, with
                    quintessentially British roots, and a less wildly creative
                    nature than Hot Wheels, its corporate sibling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What Hollywood should do, but probably won't, is tell the
                    real story of Matchbox, because it's the tale of the rise
                    and fall of the greatest toy-car empire in the world. It's a
                    story of postwar resilience, of a company holding out
                    against hard times and fighting off market change. There are
                    plucky East-End Londoners getting away with schemes on the
                    side, a public-transit system sponsored by a toy-car
                    factory, and, at the heart of things, a skilled and slightly
                    rebellious engineer.

                    After years of research, scientists at ETH Zurich have
                    <a
                      href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2024/09/one-way-street-for-sound-waves.html"

                    a method to make sound waves travel in a single direction.
                    The study was led by Professor Nicolas Noiray, who has spent
                    much of his career studying and preventing potentially
                    dangerous self-sustaining thermo-acoustic oscillations in
                    aircraft engines, believed there was a way to harness
                    similar phenomena for beneficial applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research team, led by Professor Nicolas Noiray from ETH
                    Zurich's Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering,
                    in collaboration with Romain Fleury from EPFL, figured out
                    how to prevent sound waves from traveling backward without
                    weakening their forward propagation, building upon similar
                    work from a decade ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the heart of this breakthrough is a circulator device,
                    which utilizes self-sustaining aero-acoustic oscillations.
                    The circulator consists of a disk-shaped cavity through
                    which swirling air is blown from one side through a central
                    opening. When the air is blown at a specific speed and swirl
                    intensity, it creates a whistling sound in the cavity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unlike conventional whistles that produce sound through
                    standing waves, this new design generates a spinning wave.
                    The circulator has three acoustic waveguides arranged in a
                    triangular pattern along its edge. Sound waves entering the
                    first waveguide can theoretically exit through the second or
                    third but cannot travel backward through the first.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The critical component is how the system compensates for the
                    inevitable attenuation of sound waves. The self-oscillations
                    in the circulator synchronize with the incoming waves,
                    allowing them to gain energy and maintain their strength as
                    they travel forward. This loss-compensation approach ensures
                    that the sound waves not only move in one direction but also
                    emerge stronger than when they entered the system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While the current prototype serves as a proof of
                    concept for sound waves, the team believes their
                    loss-compensated non-reciprocal wave propagation method
                    could have applications beyond acoustics, such as
                    metamaterials for electromagnetic waves. This research could
                    lead to advancements in areas such as radar technology,
                    where better control over microwave propagation is
                    essential.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, the technique could pave the way for
                    developing topological circuits, enhancing signal routing in
                    future communication systems by providing a method to guide
                    waves unidirectionally without energy loss. The research

                    Intel has begun to send formal notifications to 1,300
                    employees at its Gordon Moore Park facility, saying that
                    they only have until next month to stay in their position.

                    >, this reduction-in-force will affect more than 5% of the
                    Intel workforce in Oregon, and would make it one of the
                    largest layoffs in the state’s history.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Note that this does not include the number of employees that
                    took voluntary severance, buyouts, and early retirement
                    options. Given that the company had 23,000 workers in its
                    Oregon site earlier this year, a 15% reduction would drop
                    this to less than 20,000 employees. The 1,300 affected
                    workers would be less than half of Intel’s target reduction.
                    So, if the company will apply its reduction evenly across
                    the board, we could expect the number of workers that will
                    leave Intel, whether voluntary or not, to reach over 3,000.

                    Over the past four years, the Dragon spacecraft has returned
                    eight NASA crews by performing a parachute-assisted
                    splashdown in the ocean, but the crew capsule now has a
                    backup landing method in the event of an emergency.

                    SpaceX’s Dragon can land propulsively using its eight
                    SuperDraco thrusters, a feature that was originally intended
                    to be the spacecraft’s main way of returning to Earth but
                    was later scrapped due to safety concerns. During the live

                    of the Crew-9 launch on September 27, NASA officials
                    announced that in the event that all four parachutes fail to
                    deploy, Dragon would land on a solid surface using the
                    SuperDracos launch abort system.

                  <p>
                    “Dragon was always designed to land propulsively, but I
                    didn’t want to risk it as the primary method,” SpaceX CEO
                    Elon Musk

                    on X. During the early days of its development, SpaceX
                    marketed Dragon’s ability to land using its eight SuperDraco
                    engines, which would slow the spacecraft down during its
                    descent until its velocity reached zero, at that point its
                    landing legs would extend so the capsule can touch down on
                    the pad. However, a lot can change in ten years.

                    [...] By now, NASA has plenty of reason to trust SpaceX and
                    its ability to launch and return its crew of astronauts
                    safely to Earth. The Dragon spacecraft that recently

                    More than 6,500 volunteers have supported the accurate
                    identification of approximately 1,000 prehistoric burial
                    mounds in the Netherlands in just four months, proving the
                    value of involving volunteers in archaeology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2018, the Heritage Quest project was launched to harness
                    the power of citizen scientists, utilizing crowd-sourcing to
                    identify archaeological features on lidar imagery of the
                    central Netherlands.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Through the involvement of thousands of people online,
                    prehistoric burial mounds were identified across the region
                    in a short amount of time. However, the accuracy of
                    crowd-sourced data has been questioned in the past, as the
                    majority of volunteers are not professional archaeologists.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "While the volume of data exceeded our expectations, we
                    faced a key challenge common to large citizen science
                    projects: how reliable are the detections made by
                    volunteers?" states lead author of the research, Dr. Quentin
                    Bourgeois from Leiden University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To assess the accuracy of the data, the authors performed a
                    ground-based survey of 380 sites identified during the
                    study, examining them in person to determine whether they
                    were in fact prehistoric barrows. Their results are
                    published in the journal <i>Antiquity</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Dr. Bourgeois, the results are clear. "Citizen
                    science works. We found a direct correlation between the
                    number of volunteers identifying a potential archaeological
                    object and its likelihood of being a prehistoric burial
                    mound."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This means that the Heritage Quest project has discovered
                    1,000 previously-unknown burial mounds, doubling the number
                    of known mounds from the region in just four months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Importantly, this shows the value of involving volunteers in
                    archaeological projects, allowing for the identification of
                    archaeological features much more quickly than could be
                    achieved by professionals alone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "But for me the most amazing outcome is seeing the
                    passion the volunteers had for our research. They have now
                    become vocal advocates for the preserved traces of
                    prehistoric landscapes in their region."

                    [...] Kairos Power was founded in 2016 with the goal of
                    developing “innovative nuclear technology”. The company only
                    secured permission to build a test reactor in December last
                    year. The reactor is called Hermes and will be based in
                    Tennessee. In February, the US Department of Energy agreed
                    to provide up to $303m to help build Hermes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is possible that Google’s SMRs will face delays. The
                    completion date for Hermes has already slipped to 2027 in
                    the time since permission to build was granted, according to
                    an article in

                      >MIT Technology Review</a
                    >. The issue of sourcing uranium was also highlighted in
                    this article. After Russian’s invasion of Ukraine, the US
                    banned uranium imports from Russia and now has just three
                    years’ supply left. Kairos says it is working with a
                    European consortium to source uranium.

                    that exposure to toxic voice chat in Call of Duty has
                    declined by 43 percent since the beginning of this year. The
                    publisher credits the recent implementation of AI-based
                    moderation for the results, which have convinced it to
                    expand its use when Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on
                    October 25.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The publisher introduced the moderator, ToxMod, when it
                    launched Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III last November.
                    According to ToxMod's website, the system analyzes text
                    transcripts of in-game voice chat and detects keywords based
                    on multiple factors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To tell the difference between trash talk and harassment,
                    ToxMod monitors keywords and reactions to comments,
                    recognizing player emotions and understanding the game's
                    code of conduct. Furthermore, the system estimates the
                    perceived age and gender of the speaker and recipients to
                    understand each conversation's context better.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ToxMod can't ban anyone on its own, but it can quickly flag
                    violations for review by human moderators. Activision then
                    decides whether to warn or mute players, only issuing bans
                    after repeated infractions. The number of repeat offenders
                    in Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone fell by 67
                    percent since Activision implemented improvements in June
                    2024. In July alone, 80 percent of players caught violating
                    voice chat rules didn't re-offend.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All regions except Asia currently support ToxMod, and Call
                    of Duty uses the system to moderate voice chat in English,
                    Spanish, and Portuguese. When Black Ops 6 launches,
                    Activision will add support for French and German.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, text-based chat and username moderation expanded
                    from 14 to 20 languages in August. Community Sift has been
                    Call of Duty's text moderation partner since the first
                    Modern Warfare reboot game launched in 2019, blocking 45
                    million messages since Modern Warfare III's November
                    release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using AI to moderate player behavior is far less
                    controversial than employing the technology for in-game
                    assets. Late last year, AI-generated art
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techspot.com/news/103990-activision-blizzard-has-begun-using-ai-pick-up.html"
                      >appeared</a
                    >
                    in content skins for Modern Warfare III. Amid the historic
                    number of gaming industry layoffs occurring around that
                    time, some fear publishers will try to replace artists with
                    AI models.
