                    Some aspects of our Universe, like the strength of gravity's
                    pull, the speed of light, and the mass of an electron, don't
                    have any underlying explanation for why they have the values
                    they do. For each aspect like this, a fundamental constant
                    is required to "lock in" the specific value that we observe
                    these properties take on in our Universe. All told, we need
                    26 fundamental constants to explain the known Universe: the
                    Standard Model plus gravity. But even with that, some
                    mysteries still remain unsolved.

                  <p>
                    [...] In the Friday ruling on copyright of an AI-generated
                    image, Judge Howell wrote that Thaler attempted "to
                    complicate the issues presented by devoting a substantial
                    portion of his briefing to the viability of various legal
                    theories under which a copyright in the computer's work
                    would transfer to him, as the computer's owner; for example,
                    by operation of common law property principles or the
                    work-for-hire doctrine." But these arguments "put the cart
                    before the horse" because they only address "<em
                      >to whom</em
                    >
                    a valid copyright should have been registered," not whether
                    a copyright can be granted for a work generated without
                    human involvement, Howell wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "United States copyright law protects only works of human
                    creation," Howell wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Thaler pointed out that the Copyright Act does not
                    define the word "author." But Howell wrote that the law's
                    "'authorship' requirement as presumptively being
                    <em>human</em> rests on centuries of settled understanding."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The US Constitution conceived of copyrights and
                    patents "as forms of property that the government was
                    established to protect, and it was understood that
                    recognizing exclusive rights in that property would further
                    the public good by incentivizing individuals to create and
                    invent... Non-human actors need no incentivization with the
                    promise of exclusive rights under United States law, and
                    copyright was therefore not designed to reach them."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Copyright has never stretched far enough "to protect works
                    generated by new forms of technology operating absent any
                    guiding human hand, as plaintiff urges here. Human
                    authorship is a bedrock requirement of copyright," Howell
                    wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Future cases are likely to present more challenging
                    legal questions "regarding how much human input is necessary
                    to qualify the user of an AI system as an 'author' of a
                    generated work" and "how to assess the originality of
                    AI-generated works where the systems may have been trained
                    on unknown pre-existing works," Howell wrote. But Thaler's
                    case "is not nearly so complex."

                    Meta went as far as to claim that the original LlaMA-65B
                    model didn’t perform as well as some other, larger models
                    like the PaLM-540B because it “used a limited amount of
                    books and academic papers” in its pre-training data. The
                    original LlaMA was also formatted on C4, a version of Common
                    Crawl that was a large dataset of mass amounts of internet
                    data. Researchers found that the C4 training set included
                    mass amounts of published work,

                    Since then, Meta has clammed up hard about what goes into
                    its language models. Last month, Meta released a
                    <a
                      href="https://gizmodo.com/meta-and-microsoft-introduce-open-source-llama-2-ai-1850652165"
                      >newer, bigger language model called LlaMA 2</a
                    >. This time, Meta worked with Microsoft to add 40% more
                    data than its previous model, though in its
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09288.pdf"
                      >whitepaper</a
                    >
                    the company was much more hesitant to outright state what
                    data its latest LM was trained on. The only reference to its
                    training data was that it’s “a new mix of publicly available
                    online data.” As the friction between AI and copyright grows
                    hotter, companies are less and less likely to share exactly
                    what’s contained in the morass of AI training data.

                    Major record labels are suing the Internet Archive, accusing
                    the nonprofit of "massive" and "blatant" copyright
                    infringement "of works by some of the greatest artists of

                    was filed Friday in a US district court in New York by UMG
                    Recordings, Capitol Records, Concord Bicycle Assets, CMGI,
                    Sony Music Entertainment, and Arista Music. It targets the

                  <p>
                    For the Great 78 Project, the Internet Archive partners with
                    recording engineer George Blood— who is also a defendant in
                    the lawsuit—to digitize sound recordings on 78
                    revolutions-per-minute (RPM) records. These early sound
                    recordings are typically of poor quality and were made
                    between 1898 and the late 1950s by using very brittle
                    materials. The goal of the Great 78 Project was to preserve
                    these early recordings so they would not be lost as records
                    break and could continue to be studied as originally
                    recorded.

                    post responding to the record labels' lawsuit, Internet
                    Archive founder Brewster Kahle said that the Internet
                    Archive is currently reviewing the challenge and taking it
                    seriously. However, Kahle characterizes the Great 78 Project
                    as providing "free public access to a largely forgotten but
                    culturally important medium," claiming that "there shouldn't
                    be conflict here."<br />[...]<br />Days after record labels
                    filed their complaint, a

                    was unsealed showing that the Internet Archive had reached a
                    joint agreement with book publishers due to the publishers'
                    legal victory earlier this year. If the judge signs off, the
                    agreement would permanently bar the Internet Archive from
                    lending any unauthorized scans of books when authorized
                    e-book versions exist,
                    <a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Internet Archive would also be barred from profiting
                    from any infringing works.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's unclear how high the damages are in this case, but the
                    agreement includes an all-inclusive "confidential monetary
                    settlement" that "substantially" covers publishers' legal
                    fees and costs, as well as damages and other claims.
                    Previously it was estimated that the case could cost
                    Internet Archive more than $19 million, which

                        I've always liked mathematics; problem solving has
                        always been fun. My saving grace in life is that I was

                        education. I believe it's really important to have a
                        very solid foundation in mathematics, English, and the
                        basic sciences. Then, when you become a graduate
                        student, it's okay to learn as much as you can about
                        computers.

                Collecting charge from a ribbon of single layer graphene, with a
                pair of diodes at the nanometer scale is a novel approach to
                converting heat to electricity.

                    We theoretically consider a graphene ripple as a Brownian
                    particle coupled to an energy storage circuit. When circuit
                    and particle are at the same temperature, the second law
                    forbids harvesting energy from the thermal motion of the
                    Brownian particle, even if the circuit contains a rectifying
                    diode. However, when the circuit contains a junction
                    followed by two diodes wired in opposition, the approach to
                    equilibrium may become ultraslow. Detailed balance is
                    temporarily broken as current flows between the two diodes
                    and charges storage capacitors. The energy harvested by each
                    capacitor comes from the thermal bath of the diodes while
                    the system obeys the first and second laws of
                    thermodynamics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The scientists discovered that when the storage
                    capacitors have an initial charge of zero, the circuit draws
                    power from the thermal environment to charge them. The team
                    then demonstrated that the system satisfies both the first
                    and second laws of thermodynamics throughout the charging
                    process. They also found that larger storage capacitors
                    yield more stored charge and that a smaller graphene
                    capacitance provides both a higher initial rate of charging
                    and a longer time to discharge. These characteristics are
                    important because they allow time to disconnect the storage
                    capacitors from the energy harvesting circuit before the net
                    charge is lost.

                    India's space agency has released latest images of the Moon

                    down as planned at 18:04 local time (12:34 GMT).

                    the lander - called Vikram after Isro founder Vikram
                    Sarabhai - began its precarious descent, carrying within its
                    belly the 26kg rover named Pragyaan (the Sanskrit word for

                  <p>
                    The lander's speed was gradually reduced from 1.68km per
                    second to almost zero, enabling it to make a soft landing on
                    the lunar surface.

                    water-based ice which, scientists say, could support human
                    habitation on the Moon in future. It could also be used for
                    supplying propellant for spacecraft headed to Mars and other
                    distant destinations. Scientists say the surface area that
                    remains in permanent shadow there is huge and could hold
                    reserves of water ice.

                    significantly. OMGVflash and NVflashk have effectively
                    cracked a security feature on recent Nvidia GPUs, allowing
                    extreme overclockers to flash new vBIOS files to graphics
                    cards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    About a decade ago, Nvidia locked down its GPUs. Graphics
                    cards are governed by a vBIOS, which specifies such things
                    as the power limit of the GPU, maximum clock speed, and
                    parameters like when the GPU will shut down due to thermals.
                    Prior to Nvidia's GeForce 900-series GPUs, extreme
                    overclockers could flash a new vBIOS onto the GPU to achieve
                    higher levels of performance. But Nvidia locked this
                    functionality with an on-chip security processor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ability is returning with the new tools. Both were
                    developed by members of the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techpowerup.com/312631/nvidia-bios-signature-lock-broken-vbios-modding-and-crossflash-enabled-by-groundbreaking-new-tools"
                      >TechPowerUp</a
                    >
                    forums independently, and the outlet says it has
                    "hand-inspected the binary code" to ensure they're free of
                    viruses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Outside of tinkering, the tools can boost performance on
                    cheaper graphics cards. Many brands sell a model close to
                    list price and an overclocked model for slightly more. The
                    only difference between the cards, in most cases, is the
                    vBIOS file. The tools allow for cross-flashing as well,
                    allowing you to flash a vBIOS from one vendor onto the card
                    of a different vendor.

                    When one thinks of movie reviews, one might see them as
                    harbingers of success or failure at the box office. Some
                    researchers have previously found that both positive and
                    negative reviews correlate to box office revenues, and the
                    effect of negative reviews diminishes over time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, researchers at the University of California, Davis,
                    suggest that is not the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers analyzed pre-release commentary and opening
                    weekend box office revenue, turning the impact of movie
                    reviews on its head and revealing an unexpected harbinger of
                    failure phenomenon in the movie industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The study analyzed a plethora of pre-release movie
                    reviews penned by film critics on Rotten Tomatoes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers wanted to see if they could predict a movie's
                    success based on these reviews. As it turned out, the
                    so-called harbingers of failure did exist.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Interestingly, when these critics penned positive
                    pre-release reviews, they signaled that the movie would be a
                    flop," said Loupos. "Conversely, their negative reviews
                    hinted towards the film being a success. The stronger the
                    sentiment in either direction, the stronger the predictive
                    signal."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] What's more surprising, this pattern persisted even
                    with top critics. Expertise, it seems, does not always lead
                    to accurate predictions, Loupos said. "This surprising
                    outcome challenges the prevailing belief that positive
                    reviews equate to better box office revenues," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Our fresh perspective on the role of critics'
                    personalities opens up new avenues in our understanding of
                    the film review space," Loupos remarked. "It's an important
                    acknowledgment that the movie industry is a puzzle of
                    complexity and unpredictability."

                    [...] This study demonstrates that the perceived meaning of
                    manual labor (MML) – a novel concept introduced by the
                    researchers – is key to predicting the adoption of
                    autonomous products. Poletti says that "Consumers with a
                    high MML tend to resist the delegation of manual tasks to
                    autonomous products, irrespective of whether these tasks are
                    central to one's identity or not. Marketers can start by
                    segmenting consumers into high and low MML consumers."
                    Unlike other personality variables that can only be reliably
                    measured using complex psychometric scales, the extent of
                    consumers' MML might be assessed simply by observing their
                    behavioral characteristics, such as whether consumers tend
                    to do the dishes by hand, whether they prefer a manual car
                    transmission, or what type of activities and hobbies they
                    pursue. Activities like woodworking, cookery, painting, and
                    fishing are likely predictors of high MML. Similarly,
                    companies can measure likes on social media for specific
                    activities and hobbies that involve manual labor. Finally,
                    practitioners can ask consumers to rate the degree to which
                    manual versus cognitive tasks are meaningful to them. Having
                    segmented consumers according to their MML, marketers can
                    better target and focus their messages and efforts.

                    If and when SMRs have been deployed on site in adequate
                    numbers, GEP and IP3 plan to use thermal energy from them to
                    facilitate the electrolysis of water into clean hydrogen.
                    This hydrogen could be used to fuel backup generators on
                    site or exported to support the state's power grid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hydrogen as a fuel for backup power is yet another
                    technology being explored as an alternative to diesel
                    generators. As we reported last fall, Equinix is already

                    "We believe that this location is ideal for the logistics of
                    hydrogen shipping and distribution," Hewitt said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If all this sounds too good to be true, that's because
                    there's a lot that needs to happen before GEP's vision can
                    become a reality. This is part of the reason the two
                    companies are hedging their bets on datacenters from the get
                    go, Hewitt explained. "Let's say that the nuclear power part
                    of it kind of falls apart in terms of an opportunity; we
                    still have a datacenter site that makes money and has a
                    great client."

                  <p>
                    Of course if SMRs don't pan out, clean hydrogen generation
                    at the site is unlikely to either.

                    The FIDO2 industry standard adopted five years ago provides
                    the most secure known way to log in to websites because it
                    doesn't rely on passwords and has the most secure form of 
                    built-in two-factor authentication. Like many existing
                    security schemes today, though, FIDO faces an ominous if
                    distant threat from quantum computing, which one day will
                    cause the currently rock-solid cryptography the standard
                    uses to completely crumble.

                    Over the past decade, mathematicians and engineers have
                    scrambled to head off this cryptopocalypse with the advent
                    of PQC—short for post-quantum cryptography—a class of
                    encryption that uses algorithms resistant to
                    quantum-computing attacks. This week, researchers from
                    Google announced the

                    of the first implementation of quantum-resistant encryption
                    for use in the type of security keys that are the basic
                    building blocks of FIDO2.

                  <p>
                    The best known implementation of FIDO2 is the passwordless
                    form of authentication: passkeys. So far, there are no known
                    ways passkeys can be defeated in credential phishing
                    attacks. Dozens of sites and services now allow users to log
                    in using passkeys, which use cryptographic keys stored in
                    security keys, smartphones, and other devices.

                    The Intel 8086 processor started the x86 architecture that
                    is still extensively used today. The 8086 has some quirky
                    characteristics: it is little-endian, has a parity flag, and
                    uses explicit I/O instructions instead of just memory-mapped
                    I/O. It has four 16-bit registers that can be split into
                    8-bit registers, but only one that can be used for memory
                    indexing. Surprisingly, the reason for these characteristics
                    and more is compatibility with a computer dating back before
                    the creation of the microprocessor: the Datapoint 2200, a
                    minicomputer with a processor built out of TTL chips. In
                    this blog post, I'll look in detail at how the Datapoint
                    2200 led to the architecture of Intel's modern processors,
                    step by step through the 8008, 8080, and 8086 processors.
                  </p>
                  <p>The Datapoint 2200</p>
                  <p>
                    In the late 1960s, 80-column IBM punch cards were the
                    primary way of entering data into computers, although CRT
                    terminals were growing in popularity. The Datapoint 2200 was
                    designed as a low-cost terminal that could replace a
                    keypunch, with a squat CRT display the size of a punch card.
                    By putting some processing power into the Datapoint 2200, it
                    could perform data validation and other tasks, making data
                    entry more efficient. Even though the Datapoint 2200 was
                    typically used as an intelligent terminal, it was really a
                    desktop minicomputer with a "unique combination of powerful
                    computer, display, and dual cassette drives." Although now
                    mostly forgotten, the Datapoint 2200 was the origin of the
                    8-bit microprocessor, as I'll explain below.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The memory storage of the Datapoint 2200 had a large impact
                    on its architecture and thus the architecture of today's
                    computers. In the 1960s and early 1970s, magnetic core
                    memory was the dominant form of computer storage. It
                    consisted of tiny ferrite rings, threaded into grids, with
                    each ring storing one bit. Magnetic core storage was bulky
                    and relatively expensive, though.

                    New theoretical research by Michael Wondrak, Walter van
                    Suijlekom and Heino Falcke of Radboud University has shown
                    that Stephen Hawking was right about black holes, although
                    not completely. Due to Hawking radiation, black holes will
                    eventually evaporate, but the event horizon is not as
                    crucial as has been believed. Gravity and the curvature of
                    spacetime cause this radiation too. This means that all
                    large objects in the universe, like the remnants of stars,
                    will eventually evaporate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Van Suijlekom: 'We show that far beyond a black hole
                    the curvature of spacetime plays a big role in creating
                    radiation. The particles are already separated there by the
                    tidal forces of the gravitational field.' Whereas it was
                    previously thought that no radiation was possible without
                    the event horizon, this study shows that this horizon is not
                    necessary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Falcke: 'That means that objects without an event horizon,
                    such as the remnants of dead stars and other large objects
                    in the universe, also have this sort of radiation. And,
                    after a very long period, that would lead to everything in
                    the universe eventually evaporating, just like black holes.
                    This changes not only our understanding of Hawking radiation
                    but also our view of the universe and its future.'

                vehicles around the world, face limitations related to cost,
                finite resources, and safety concerns. The work is published in
                the journal EcoMat.<br />...<br />A zinc–air battery consists of
                a zinc negative electrode and an air positive electrode.<br />...<br />ECU's
                breakthrough has enabled engineers to use a combination of new
                materials, such as carbon, cheaper iron and cobalt based
                minerals to redesign zinc-air batteries.<br />"The new design
                has been so efficient it suppressed the internal resistance of
                batteries, and their voltage was close to the theoretical
                voltage which resulted in a high peak power density and
                ultra-long stability," Dr. Azhar said.

                    [...] In contrast to the Defcon subway-hacking blowup of
                    2008—and in a sign of how far companies and government
                    agencies have come in their relationship with the
                    cybersecurity community—the four hackers say the MBTA didn't
                    threaten to sue them or try to block their Defcon talk.
                    Instead, it invited them to the transit authority
                    headquarters earlier this year to deliver a presentation on
                    the vulnerabilities they'd found. Then the MBTA politely
                    asked that they obscure part of their technique to make it
                    harder for other hackers to replicate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The hackers say the MBTA hasn't actually fixed the
                    vulnerabilities they discovered and instead appears to be
                    waiting for an entirely new subway card system that it plans
                    to roll out in 2025. When WIRED reached out to the MBTA, its
                    director of communications, Joe Pesaturo, responded in a
                    statement that "the MBTA was pleased that the students
                    reached out and worked collaboratively with the fare
                    collection team."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] So are all four of them using their
                    CharlieCard-hacking technique to roam the Boston subway
                    system for free? "No comment."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For now, the hacker team is just happy to be able to give
                    their talk without the heavy-handed censorship that the MBTA
                    attempted with its lawsuit 15 years ago. Harris argues that
                    the MBTA likely learned its lesson from that approach, which
                    only drew attention to the hackers' findings. "It's great
                    that they're not doing that now—that they're not shooting
                    themselves in the foot. And it's a lot less stressful for
                    everyone," Harris says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He's also glad, on the other hand, that the MBTA took such a
                    hardline approach to the 2008 talk that it got his attention
                    and kickstarted the group's research almost a decade and a
                    half later. "If they hadn't done that," Harris says, "we
                    wouldn't be here."

              <p>
                In 2020 Microsoft laid off dozens of journalists, in a move to
                rely on artificial intelligence. Those journalists were
                responsible for selecting content for Microsoft platforms,
                including MSN and the Edge browser. A recent tourism article now
                reminds us of that earlier business decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                Published last week and titled "Headed to Ottawa? Here's what
                you shouldn't miss!" the article listed 15 must-see attractions
                for visitors to the Canadian capital. Microsoft has since
                removed the article that advised tourists to visit the
                "beautiful" Ottawa Food Bank on an empty stomach. That appears
                to be an out-of-context rewrite of a paragraph on the food
                bank's website. "Life is challenging enough," it says. "Imagine
                facing it on an empty stomach."
              </p>
              <p>
                The remainder of the must-see list was rife with errors. It
                featured a photo of the Rideau River in an entry about the
                Rideau Canal, and a photo of the Rideau Canal in an entry about
                Parc Omega near Montebello, Quebec. It advised tourists to enjoy
                the pristine grass of "Parliament Hills."
              </p>
              <p>
                The article carried the byline "Microsoft Travel." There is
                nothing on the page that identifies it as the product of AI.
                Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment
                on how the article was generated. While now removed, it is still
                available via the Internet Archive.<br /><a

                    U.S. spy agencies will share more intelligence with U.S.
                    companies, nongovernmental organizations and academia under
                    a new strategy released this week that acknowledges concerns
                    over new threats, such as another pandemic and increasing
                    cyberattacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The National Intelligence Strategy, which sets broad goals
                    for the sprawling U.S. intelligence community, says that spy
                    agencies must reach beyond the traditional walls of secrecy
                    and partner with outside groups to detect and deter
                    supply-chain disruptions, infectious diseases and other
                    growing transnational threats.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The intelligence community "must rethink its approach to
                    exchanging information and insights," the strategy says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The U.S. government in recent years has begun sharing vast
                    amounts of cyber-threat intelligence with U.S. companies,
                    utilities and others who are often the main targets of
                    foreign hackers, as well as information on foreign-influence
                    operations with social-media companies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Illustrating the changing threats, a senior U.S.
                    official said that the daily intelligence briefing prepared
                    for President Biden and his top advisers—once dominated by
                    terrorism and the Middle East—now regularly covers topics as
                    varied as China's artificial-intelligence work, the
                    geopolitical impacts of climate change, and semiconductor
                    chips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The 16-page document, which contains no budget or
                    program details, also says spy agencies must support the
                    U.S. in its competition with authoritarian governments such
                    as China and Russia, particularly in technological arenas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On transnational threats such as financial crises, narcotics
                    trafficking, supply-chain disruption and infectious
                    diseases, the document calls on intelligence agencies to
                    strengthen their internal capabilities to warn U.S.
                    policymakers of looming threats.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The emphasis on greater intelligence sharing is part
                    of a broader trend toward declassification that the Biden
                    administration has pursued. The United States has released
                    unprecedented levels of formerly secret intelligence to warn
                    of Russia's plans in Ukraine and its quest for weapons from
                    China, Iran and North Korea.

                    But although the new study's "approach is quite
                    interesting," the fertility link poses a new puzzle, says
                    geneticist Tábita Hünemeier at the University of São Paulo.
                    The fertility boost is "so great" that natural selection
                    should have led to a much higher frequency of
                    <em>APOE4</em> in the Tsimané, she suggests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Alzheimer's and heart disease rates are low even among older
                    Tsimané people, perhaps because of their active lifestyle,
                    Trumble's group has reported. But he says
                    <em>APOE4</em> could still have detrimental effects that
                    balance the benefits—it may reduce fertility in men, for
                    example, or decrease child survival. "Our next step is to
                    figure out whether there are disadvantages at certain life
                    stages," he says.

                    are plotting for mankind’s return to the lunar surface over
                    the next decade. Unlike the days of Apollo, the modern-day
                    race to the Moon involves establishing a sustainable
                    presence and a thriving economy on and around Earth’s
                    natural satellite.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an attempt to guide ongoing efforts in establishing a
                    lunar infrastructure, the Defense Advanced Research Projects
                    Agency (DARPA) kicked off a seven-month study dedicated to
                    developing an analytical framework for scientific and
                    commercial activity on the Moon. Through the 10-Year Lunar
                    Architecture, or LunA-10, study, DARPA is seeking ideas for
                    technology and infrastructure concepts that could help build
                    a Moon-based economy within the next decade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “A large paradigm shift is coming in the next 10 years for
                    the lunar economy,” Michael Nayak, program manager at
                    DARPA’s Strategic Technology Office, said in a
                    <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2023-08-15"
                      >statement</a
                    >. “To get to a turning point faster, LunA-10 uniquely aims
                    to identify solutions that can enable multi-mission lunar
                    systems – imagine a wireless power station that can also
                    provide comms and navigation in its beam.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Luna-10 will select a group of companies that have an
                    idea for lunar services, allowing them to work together to
                    develop an integrated system for lunar communication,
                    energy, transmission or other building blocks necessary to
                    create a future economy on the Moon. The participating
                    companies will be announced in October 2023, with the final
                    report due by June 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    DARPA, however, will not fund the construction or
                    transportation of any of the concepts developed as part of
                    the study. Instead, the agency will provide its “economic
                    expertise to all LunA-10 teams to help analyze and validate
                    definitions of a critical mass to create a thriving,
                    survivable lunar economy,” DARPA wrote in its statement.

                    Russia's unmanned Luna-25 spacecraft has crashed into the

                  <p>It was Russia's first Moon mission in almost 50 years.</p>
                  <p>
                    The craft was due to be the first ever to land on the Moon's
                    south pole, but failed after encountering problems as it

                    Preliminary findings showed that the 800kg lander had
                    "ceased to exist as a result of a collision with the surface

                    ChatGPT, OpenAI's fabulating chatbot, produces wrong answers
                    to software programming questions more than half the time,
                    according to a study from Purdue University. That said, the
                    bot was convincing enough to fool a third of participants.

                  <p>
                    The Purdue team analyzed ChatGPT's answers to 517 Stack
                    Overflow questions to assess the correctness, consistency,
                    comprehensiveness, and conciseness of ChatGPT's answers. The
                    US academics also conducted linguistic and sentiment
                    analysis of the answers, and questioned a dozen volunteer
                    participants on the results generated by the model.

                    "Our analysis shows that 52 percent of ChatGPT answers are
                    incorrect and 77 percent are verbose," the team's paper
                    concluded. "Nonetheless, ChatGPT answers are still preferred
                    39.34 percent of the time due to their comprehensiveness and
                    well-articulated language style." Among the set of preferred

                    ChatGPT and Stack Overflow Answers to Software Engineering
                    Questions." It was written by researchers Samia Kabir, David
                    Udo-Imeh, Bonan Kou, and assistant professor Tianyi Zhang.

                    "During our study, we observed that only when the error in
                    the ChatGPT answer is obvious, users can identify the
                    error," their paper stated. "However, when the error is not
                    readily verifiable or requires external IDE or
                    documentation, users often fail to identify the
                    incorrectness or underestimate the degree of error in the

                    Even when the answer has a glaring error, the paper stated,
                    two out of the 12 participants still marked the response
                    preferred. The paper attributes this to ChatGPT's pleasant,
                    authoritative style.

                    language, articulated and text-book style answers,
                    comprehensiveness, and affiliation in answers make
                    completely wrong answers seem correct," the paper explained.

                    A new study finds a chemical formed when we digest a widely
                    used sweetener is "genotoxic," meaning it breaks up DNA. The
                    chemical is also found in trace amounts in the sweetener
                    itself, and the finding raises questions about how the
                    sweetener may contribute to health problems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At issue is sucralose, a widely used artificial sweetener.
                    Previous work by the same research team established that
                    several fat-soluble compounds are produced in the gut after
                    sucralose ingestion. One of these compounds is
                    sucralose-6-acetate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our new work establishes that sucralose-6-acetate is
                    genotoxic," says Susan Schiffman, corresponding author of
                    the study and an adjunct professor in the joint department
                    of biomedical engineering at North Carolina State University
                    and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "We
                    also found that trace amounts of sucralose-6-acetate can be
                    found in off-the-shelf sucralose, even before it is consumed
                    and metabolized.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To put this in context, the European Food Safety Authority
                    has a threshold of toxicological concern for all genotoxic
                    substances of 0.15 micrograms per person per day," Schiffman
                    says. "Our work suggests that the trace amounts of
                    sucralose-6-acetate in a single, daily sucralose-sweetened
                    drink exceed that threshold. And that's not even accounting
                    for the amount of sucralose-6-acetate produced as
                    metabolites after people consume sucralose."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "In short, we found that sucralose-6-acetate is
                    genotoxic, and that it effectively broke up DNA in cells
                    that were exposed to the chemical," Schiffman says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This work raises a host of concerns about the
                    potential health effects associated with sucralose and its
                    metabolites. It's time to revisit the safety and regulatory
                    status of sucralose, because the evidence is mounting that
                    it carries significant risks. If nothing else, I encourage
                    people to avoid products containing sucralose. It's
                    something you should not be eating."

                    Debian is the beating "heart" of gLinux Rodete, the Linux OS
                    internally run by Google, it provided a very convenient way
                    (free as "free in beer") to build some of the most massive
                    cloud infrastructures available today (AWS), and of course
                    it was used as the foundation of Ubuntu.

                  <p>
                    Nowadays, Ubuntu Linux formally is the most popular free OS
                    with a 33.9% market share, while Debian gets the second
                    place with a 16% share. And then there's the ginormous
                    Chinese market, where Beijing authorities promoted a program
                    to replace Windows with Linux. Chinese users adopted Kylin,
                    which is an Ubuntu remix, and Uniontech's UOS systems with
                    the end-user Linux Deepin system, which is also based on
                    Debian.

                Estrogen can harm aquatic plants and animals when passed into
                waterways via human and agricultural waste streams. Researchers
                have now developed a new way of removing the hormone from water,
                however, using what's known as "smart rust."
              </p>
              <p>
                Developed by scientists at Germany's University of
                Erlangen-Nuremberg, smart rust takes the form of spherical iron
                oxide (aka rust) nanoparticles that are covered in phosphonic
                acid molecules. The molecules protrude from the surface of the
                spheres like hairs. By binding different compounds to the ends
                of those hairs, it's possible to make them adsorb different
                types of waterborne pollutants.
              </p>
              <p>
                The iron oxide particles themselves are superparamagnetic,
                meaning they're attracted to magnets but not to one another.
                This quality keeps them from clumping together – so they can be
                thoroughly mixed into tainted water – while also making it
                possible to subsequently remove them from that water simply by
                swirling a magnet through the liquid.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] Due to the fact that estrogen molecules consist of a large
                steroid body with a slight negative charge, he coated smart rust
                particles with two types of molecules. One of these has
                particularly long "hairs," while the other is positively
                charged. When combined on the surface of the iron oxide spheres,
                these molecules form multitudes of estrogen-trapping pockets.
              </p>
              <p>
                When tested on water spiked with estradiol, which is the most
                potent type of estrogen, the new form of smart rust successfully
                removed the hormone from that water. Further research will now
                explore how well the technology works in real-world conditions,
                and how many times the particles can be reused.

                    this week alleging that a company that makes price-setting
                    software for apartments and nine of the nation's biggest
                    property managers formed a cartel to artificially inflate
                    rents in violation of federal law.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit was filed days after

                    >
                    raising concerns that the software, sold by Texas-based
                    RealPage, is potentially pushing rent prices above
                    competitive levels, facilitating price-fixing, or both.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The proposed class-action lawsuit was filed in US District
                    Court in San Diego.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an email, a RealPage representative said that the company
                    "strongly denies the allegations and will vigorously defend
                    against the lawsuit." She declined to comment further,
                    saying the company does not comment on pending litigation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The lawsuit accused the property managers and RealPage
                    of forming "a cartel to artificially inflate the price of
                    and artificially decrease the supply and output of
                    multifamily residential real estate leases from competitive
                    levels."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    RealPage's software uses an algorithm to churn through a
                    trove of data each night to suggest daily prices for
                    available rental units. The software uses not only
                    information about the apartment being priced and the
                    property where it is located, but also private data on what
                    nearby competitors are charging in rents. The software
                    considers actual rents paid to those rivals—not just what
                    they are advertising, the company told ProPublica.

                    Google has been testing several ways to combat users who use
                    ad-blockers on its YouTube video streaming site. One of the
                    first tests informed users that
                    <a
                      href="https://www.ghacks.net/2023/05/11/youtube-is-blocking-ad-blockers-to-push-premium-subscription/"
                      >ad blockers are not allowed on YouTube</a
                    >. The prompt, which blocks access to the site, offers three
                    options to users to react to it. The two prominent ones are
                    to configure the content blocker to allow ads on YouTube or
                    to subscribe to the paid service YouTube Premium.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A small close icon in the top right corner is the third and
                    less focused option. Users have the option to click on the
                    x-icon to close the prompt and continue using YouTube.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, it appears, Google is making this option less
                    attractive to users on the site. Instead of displaying the
                    close icon directly, YouTube is now showing a timer in its
                    place. In other words: users who get the prompt have to wait
                    between 30 to 60 seconds before they can close the entire
                    prompt and start using the site.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The notification appears to hit users of different content
                    blockers, including uBlock Origin. It seems that the
                    majority of users are not getting these prompts, likely
                    because Google is still testing reception and the rate of
                    return.

                When NASA's Psyche probe launches in October on its mission to a
                metal asteroid as much as 309 million miles (497 million km)
                from Earth, it will be carrying a new laser communications
                system that promises to revolutionize deep space missions.<br />...<br />By
                relying on old-fashioned X-band radio systems, crewed and
                robotic missions suffer from bandwidths and transmission speeds
                that are ridiculously small and slow. A single high resolution
                image from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter can take an hour
                and a half to send and the data from the New Horizons
                spacecraft's flyby of Pluto took 16 days to download.
              </p>
              <p>
                In light of this, NASA has been experimenting with using lasers
                as a way to not only create much faster direct links between
                space missions and Earth, but also to free up the Deep Space
                Network (DSN) of antennas for more important tasks than routine
                communications.

                    When Intel joined the discrete GPU market almost a year ago,
                    everyone wondered when it would catch up with Nvidia and
                    AMD. As of August 2023, it apparently has, at least in one
                    respect; like its competitors, Intel has introduced a
                    telemetry collection service by default in the latest beta
                    driver for its Arc GPUs. You can opt out of it, but we all
                    know most people just click "yes" to everything during a
                    software installation. Intel's release notes for the drivers
                    don't mention this change to how its drivers work, which is
                    a curious omission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    News of Intel adding telemetry collection to its drivers is
                    a significant change to how its GPU drivers work. Intel has
                    even given this new collation routine a cute name—the Intel
                    Computing Improvement Program. Gee, that sounds pretty
                    wonderful. We want to improve our computing, so let's dive
                    into the details briefly.

                      >According</a
                    >
                    to TechPowerUp, which discovered the change, Intel has
                    created a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/topics/idsa-cip.html"
                      >landing page</a
                    >
                    for the program that explains what is collected and what
                    isn't. At a high level, it states, "This program uses
                    information about your computer's performance to make
                    product improvements that may benefit you in the future."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Though this sounds like an egregious overreach
                    regarding the type of data captured, to be fair to Intel, it
                    allows you to opt out of this program. That is apparently
                    not the case with Nvidia, which doesn't even ask for
                    permission at any point during driver installation,
                    according to TechPowerUp. AMD, on the other hand,
                    <em>does</em> give you a choice to opt out like Intel does,
                    regardless of what other options you choose during
                    installation, and even provides an explainer about what it's
                    collecting.

                    Thousands of websites belonging to US government agencies,
                    leading universities, and professional organizations have
                    been hijacked over the last half decade and used to push
                    scammy offers and promotions, new research has found. Many
                    of these scams are aimed at children and attempt to trick
                    them into downloading apps, malware, or submitting personal
                    details in exchange for nonexistent rewards in

                    For more than three years, security researcher Zach Edwards
                    has been tracking these website hijackings and scams. He
                    says the activity can be linked back to the activities of
                    affiliate users of one advertising company. The
                    US-registered company acts as a service that sends web
                    traffic to a range of online advertisers, allowing
                    individuals to sign up and use its systems. However, on any
                    given day, Edwards, a senior manager of threat insights at
                    <a href="https://www.humansecurity.com/">Human Security</a>,
                    uncovers scores of .gov, .org, and .edu domains being
                    compromised.

                    [...] The schemes and ways people make money are complex,
                    but each of the websites is hijacked in a similar way.
                    Vulnerabilities or weaknesses in a website's backend, or its
                    content management system, are exploited by attackers who
                    upload malicious PDF files to the website. These documents,
                    which Edwards calls “poison PDFs,” are designed to show up
                    in search engines and promote “free Fortnite skins,”
                    generators for Roblox’s in-game currency, or cheap streams
                    of Barbie, Oppenheimer, and other popular films.

                    The new law behind the ban, signed by Governor Kim Reynolds,
                    is part of a wave of educational reforms that Republican
                    lawmakers believe are necessary to protect students from
                    exposure to damaging and obscene materials. Specifically,
                    <a

                    >
                    mandates that every book available to students in school
                    libraries be "age appropriate" and devoid of any
                    "descriptions or visual depictions of a sex act," per Iowa
                    Code 702.17.

                  <p>
                    But banning books is hard work, according to administrators,
                    so they need to rely on machine intelligence to get it done
                    within the three-month window mandated by the law. "It is
                    simply not feasible to read every book and filter for these
                    new requirements," said Bridgette Exman, the assistant
                    superintendent of the school district, in a statement quoted
                    by The Gazette. "Therefore, we are using what we believe is
                    a defensible process to identify books that should be
                    removed from collections at the start of the 23-24 school
                    year."

                    outsource the decision to a system that can't understand
                    books and can't critically think at all," Dr. Margaret

                    Desert ants have outstanding navigational skills. They live
                    in the saltpans of North Africa, an extremely inhospitable
                    environment. To find food for their nest mates, foraging
                    ants have to walk far into the desert. Once they have found
                    food, for example a dead insect, their actual problem
                    begins: How do they find their way back to their nest as
                    quickly as possible in the extremely hot and barren
                    environment? "The desert ant
                    <em>Cataglyphis fortis</em> stands out due its remarkable
                    ability to successfully navigate and forage in even the
                    harshest environments, making it an excellent subject for
                    studying the intricacies of navigation. With an innate
                    navigation mechanism called path integration, these ants use
                    both a sun compass and a step counter to measure the
                    distances they cover. In addition, they possess the ability
                    to learn and utilize visible and olfactory cues. We believe
                    that this extremely harsh habitat has led, during evolution,
                    to a navigation system of unsurpassed precision," said
                    Marilia Freire, the study's lead author, summarizing what is
                    known so far about the amazing orientation skills of these
                    small animals.

                    The scientists had noticed during previous studies in
                    Tunisia that the nests in the center of the saltpans, where
                    there are hardly any visible landmarks, had high mounds at
                    the nest entrances. In contrast, nest hills near the
                    shrub-covered edges of the saltpans were lower or barely
                    noticeable. So the research team has wondered for some time
                    if these visible differences serve a purpose in helping the
                    ants better find their way home. "It's always hard to tell
                    whether an animal does something on purpose or not. The high
                    nest mounds in the middle of the saltpans could have been a
                    side effect of differences in soil structure or wind
                    conditions. However, crucial for our study was the idea to
                    remove the mounds and to provide some nests with artificial
                    landmarks and others not, and to observe what would happen,"
                    Markus Knaden, head of the Project Group Odor-guided
                    Behavior in the Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology,
                    explains the goal of the study.

                  <p>
                    [...] Experiments in which ants could be tracked with
                    particular accuracy during the last meters to the nest,
                    thanks to a grid painted on the floor, showed that the nest
                    hills are important visual cues. If they were removed, fewer
                    ants found their way back to the nest, while their nest
                    mates simultaneously began to rebuild nest mounds as quickly
                    as possible. If, on the other hand, the scientists placed
                    artificial landmarks in the form of small black cylinders
                    near the nest entrances whose mounds they had previously
                    removed, the ants did not invest in building new ones.
                    Apparently, the cylinders were sufficient for orientation.

                    In ant nests, labor is divided. Ants that go foraging are
                    usually older and more experienced nest members, while
                    younger ants are busy building. Therefore, there must be
                    some kind of information flow between the two groups. The
                    researchers do not yet know exactly how this is achieved.
                    "One possibility would be that ants in the nest somehow
                    notice that fewer foragers return home, and as a result,
                    hill-building activities at the nest entrance are
                    increased," says Marilia Freire.

                    Markus Knaden has been studying desert ants for 25 years and
                    is still amazed by their fascinating abilities: "The animals
                    can learn visual and olfactory cues despite their small
                    brains. In addition, they are able to decide which
                    information is useful for their navigation and which is not.
                    All this was already known. However, the fact that they even
                    build their own landmarks for orientation and only choose to
                    invest in this work when other environmental cues are
                    missing is quite surprising."

                    What’s a plane without an engine? After aerospace company
                    Pratt &amp; Whitney issued a recall on some of its engine
                    models, airline companies in the U.S. and Europe are

                    that after Pratt &amp; Whitney issued a recall on thousands
                    of engines on Airbus aircraft, major airlines like Spirit,
                    JetBlue, Hawaiian Airlines, and Wizz Air were forced to
                    change their schedules dramatically. The outlet says that
                    Wizz Air—a Hungarian airline that serves most of Europe—is
                    temporarily mulling over scrapping some flights while
                    dealing with maintenance issues as the engine recall
                    overworks staff. Spirit Airlines is facing a slump in
                    revenue with seven Airbuses in its fleet being grounded,
                    potentially through the end of the year, while cutting its
                    planned capacity by 5%

                    for its Geared Turbofan engines, which are used to power
                    A320neo Airbus jets. Pratt &amp; Whitney said that
                    contaminants were found in the metal used to build the
                    machines. The mishap is affecting around 1,200 engines
                    produced by the company and will require an inspection
                    period that could take as much as two months. The recall is
                    likely to have an impact on the remainder of the busy summer
                    travel season and—if Spirit’s estimates of being grounded
                    throughout the year are correct—could impact the holiday
                    travel window as well.

                    SARS-CoV-2 can also bind with other proteins, however. Was
                    it possible, the scientists wondered, that it could use
                    those other proteins to infiltrate cells? The answer was
                    yes. ACE-2 was the most efficient route, but it was not the
                    only route. And that suggests that the virus can bind and
                    infect even cells without any ACE-2 receptors at all.

                    That unexpected finding may help explain why coronaviruses
                    are so adept at species-hopping, Kasson says. And that makes
                    it even more important that scientists keep a close eye on
                    them, he notes.

                    learn how they spread and what to watch out for."

                    The WTP (willingness to pay) indicator is used to assess
                    purchasing power, which represents the maximum amount that a
                    buyer is willing to pay for a product. Marketers use
                    surveys, focus groups and interviews to determine WTP, but
                    this approach can be expensive, time-consuming, and does not
                    always provide an accurate representation of respondents'
                    preferences.

                To improve productivity in the office MS-Office is getting a new
                UI ... or well it's getting a new default font and some new
                colours anyway. No more yellow! How this will improve
                productivity or make people write or calculate or power-point
                better is probably unclear, it's probably not even the purpose.
                This seems like change for the sake of change.

              <p>
                Unfortunately they are making the default font a non-serif font
                again, but they are changing the name cause you can't have a
                font named "Beer Town" as the default font. Bring back Times New
                Roman!

                  <p>
                    A new study reports conclusive evidence for the breakdown of
                    standard gravity in the low acceleration limit from a
                    verifiable analysis of the orbital motions of long-period,
                    widely separated, binary stars, usually referred to as wide
                    binaries in astronomy and astrophysics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study carried out by Kyu-Hyun Chae, professor of physics
                    and astronomy at Sejong University in Seoul, used up to
                    26,500 wide binaries within 650 light years (LY) observed by
                    European Space Agency's Gaia space telescope. The study was
                    published in the 1 August 2023 issue of the Astrophysical
                    Journal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Chae explains, "From the start it seemed clear to me
                    that gravity could be most directly and efficiently tested
                    by calculating accelerations because gravitational field
                    itself is an acceleration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The study finds that when two stars orbit around with
                    each other with accelerations lower than about one nanometer
                    per second squared start to deviate from the prediction by
                    Newton's universal law of gravitation and Einstein's general
                    relativity.

              <p>
                What is intriguing is that this ... was suggested 40 years ago
                by theoretical physicist Mordehai Milgrom.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, what the wide binary data show are not only the breakdown
                of Newtonian dynamics but also the manifestation of the external
                field effect of modified gravity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike galactic rotation curves in which the observed boosted
                accelerations can, in principle, be attributed to dark matter in
                the Newton-Einstein standard gravity,
                <b
                  >wide binary dynamics cannot be affected by (Dark Matter) even
                  if it existed.</b
                >
                (Emphasis and changes are mine)
              </p>
              <p>
                Wide binary anomalies are a disaster to the standard gravity and
                cosmology that rely on dark matter and dark energy concepts.
                Because gravity follows MOND, a large amount of dark matter in
                galaxies (and even in the universe) are no longer needed. This
                is also a big surprise to Chae who, like typical scientists,
                "believed in" dark matter until a few years ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm not pushing MOND, just pushing back against Dark Matter.

                    The US broadband industry is united in opposition to a
                    requirement that Internet service providers list all of
                    their monthly fees. Five lobby groups representing cable
                    companies, fiber and DSL providers, and mobile operators

                    and in a meeting with FCC officials. The requirement that
                    ISPs list all their monthly fees "would add unnecessary
                    complexity and burdens to the label for consumers and
                    providers and could result in some providers having to
                    create many labels for any given plan," the groups said in

                    own filing urging the FCC to scrap the rules in June. The

                    consumer advocates, as we

                    is already trying to create loopholes. This request would
                    allow the big ISPs to continue hiding the true cost of
                    service and frustrating customers with poor service," Joshua

                    ISPs could avoid the requirement to collect identifying

                    (CDL) service, which provides users with free access to a
                    digital library of books. US District Judge John Koeltl
                    decided that the IA infringed the copyright of four
                    publishers when it relaxed its CDL limitations during the
                    pandemic, but now the Archive has seemingly reached an
                    agreement with said publishers which could clear the way for
                    an appeal.

                    between the Archive and Hachette, HarperCollins, John Wiley
                    &amp; Sons, and Penguin Random House will require the IA to
                    pay an unspecified amount of money to the four publishers if
                    the appeal is unsuccessful. The publishing companies are
                    "extremely pleased" with the proposed injunction, as it
                    extends the copyright controversy to thousands of books
                    still in their catalogs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The IA was sued in 2020 after it started lending free
                    digital copies of its books during the pandemic, a practice
                    the Archive compared to book lending from traditional,
                    physical libraries. The CDL service was protected by the
                    fair use doctrine, the Archive argued, but Koeltl decided
                    otherwise. The Archive was lending free ebooks that were
                    being licensed to traditional libraries, the judge
                    determined.

                  <p>
                    If accepted, the consent judgment will provide the Archive a
                    chance to overturn Koeltl's unfavorable decision in the
                    appeal. The publishers defined the CDL service as a mass
                    copyright infringement operation, but the Archive
                    <a
                      href="https://blog.archive.org/2023/08/11/our-fight-is-far-from-over/"

                    >
                    that its fight is "far from over." The IA team firmly
                    believes that libraries should be able to "own, preserve,
                    and lend digital books" outside the limitations of temporary
                    licensed access (i.e., copyright).

                    [...] Current efforts to curb the strength and presence of
                    digital libraries – and the Internet Archive itself – are
                    cutting off the public's access to truth "at a key time in
                    our democracy," [Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle]
                    said. Strong libraries are paramount for a healthy
                    democracy, and that's why the IA is appealing Judge Koeltl's
                    decision.

                    The texts contain the earliest recorded use of 'red herring'
                    in English, extremely rare forms of medieval literature, as
                    well as a killer rabbit worthy of Monty Python. The
                    discovery changes the way we should think about English
                    comic culture between Chaucer and Shakespeare.

                    [...] Throughout the Middle Ages, minstrels travelled
                    between fairs, taverns and baronial halls to entertain
                    people with songs and stories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fictional minstrels are common in medieval literature but
                    references to real-life performers are rare and fleeting. We
                    have first names, payments, instruments played and
                    occasionally locations, but until now virtually no evidence
                    of their lives or work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr James Wade, from the University of Cambridge's English
                    Faculty and Girton College, came across the texts by
                    accident while researching in the National Library of
                    Scotland. He then had a "moment of epiphany" when he noticed
                    the scribe had written:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em
                      >'By me, Richard Heege, because I was at that feast and
                      did not have a drink.'</em
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It was an intriguing display of humour and it's rare for
                    medieval scribes to share that much of their character,"
                    Wade says. That made him investigate how, where and why
                    Heege had copied out the texts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This booklet contains three texts and Wade concludes
                    that around the year 1480 Heege copied them from a now lost
                    memory-aid written by an unknown minstrel performing near
                    the Derbyshire-Nottinghamshire border.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Most medieval poetry, song and storytelling has been
                    lost", Wade says. "Manuscripts often preserve relics of high
                    art. This is something else. It's mad and offensive, but
                    just as valuable."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Wade thinks the minstrel wrote part of his act down
                    because its many nonsense sequences would have been
                    extremely difficult to recall. "He didn't give himself the
                    kind of repetition or story trajectory which would have made
                    things simpler to remember," Wade says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The texts add to what we thought minstrels did.
                    Fictional depictions suggest they performed ballads about
                    Robin Hood, chivalric romances, adventure stories and songs
                    about great battles.

                    Climate change will make stomach bugs an even bigger
                    problem, a new report has found. The study concludes that
                    expected changes in temperature, precipitation, and humidity
                    will make foodborne infections and toxins all the more
                    common—at least in Germany. That said, other research has
                    indicated that these increased risks will be seen globally
                    as well.

                    earlier this June in the
                    <em>Journal of Health Monitoring</em>. It’s a review of the
                    literature and focuses on common foodborne illnesses caused
                    by <em>Salmonella</em>,<em> Campylobacter</em>,and<em>

                  <p>
                    Across the board, the researchers found evidence that all
                    these infections and toxin poisonings will steadily increase
                    in the years to come due to climate change, though for many
                    varying reasons.

                    [...] Important as these warnings are, the authors of the
                    current report say that it’s well past time to start taking
                    action to mitigate these risks, both on a small and large
                    scale.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Our main recommendations for minimizing the health risk
                    from foodborne infections and intoxications lie in the area
                    of kitchen hygiene, which should always be applied when
                    preparing food,” the scientists wrote. “This includes
                    thorough handwashing and the use of fresh kitchen utensils
                    after handling raw meat and fish, as well as avoidance of
                    cross-contamination,” the authors wrote.

                  <p>
                    To which they added: “We also recommend the use of new
                    technologies to track supply chains. Given a globalized food
                    distribution network and the use of different processing and
                    preservation techniques, it can be difficult to track a
                    product’s supply chain to identify potential risks.”

                    Specifically, the analysis found that a “basket” of the most
                    popular streaming services now costs $87 a month, up $10
                    from just a year ago. That’s more than the monthly cost for
                    the typical cable bundle, which is $83 a month, the
                    Financial Times reports.

                  <p>
                    [...] Why have streaming prices gone up so quickly? Because
                    the streaming gold rush is over, and rather than looking for
                    growth from the big streamers, Wall Street now wants to see
                    profits.

                    Of course, those of us who cut the cord years ago probably
                    won’t be in any rush to go back to Big Cable. But if you’re

              <p>How many subs should we publish on this site?</p>
              <p>
                If we'd put on just a single story for each topic (software,
                hardware, news, science, security, politics and so on), and keep
                it on the frontpage for a week, would that work for you? If we'd
                publish hundred stories each day, would you start or continue
                commenting?
              </p>
              <p>
                In short, can you think of a magic cast, in terms of number and
                frequency of stories, to lure an optimum number of people into
                posting here? If so, which would be the factors in your
                mathematical formula?
