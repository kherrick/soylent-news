                    A team of French and Japanese environmental scientists has
                    found that one kind of oil-eating microbe reshapes droplets
                    to optimize biodegradation. In their study, reported in the
                    journal Science, the group isolated Alcanivorax borkumensis
                    bacteria specimens in a lab setting, fed them crude oil, and
                    then watched how they worked together to eat the oil as
                    quickly and efficiently as possible.<br />...<br />In one
                    experiment, A. borkumensis samples that had not been exposed
                    to crude oil before were introduced to simple crude oil
                    droplets. Groups of the bacteria converged on a droplet,
                    forming a sphere. The sphere shape persisted until the
                    entire oil droplet had been consumed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But when the team exposed samples with experience consuming
                    crude oil, their behavior was much more advanced. Initially,
                    upon converging on a droplet, a sphere formed—but then
                    finger-like protrusions formed, radiating out from the
                    sphere, each completely covered with bacteria. The result
                    was much faster, more efficient consumption of the droplet.

                    A newly discovered zero-day in the widely used WinRAR
                    file-compression program has been exploited for four months
                    by unknown attackers who are using it to install malware
                    when targets open booby-trapped JPGs and other innocuous
                    inside file archives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The vulnerability, residing in the way WinRAR processes the
                    ZIP file format, has been under active exploit since April
                    in securities trading forums, researchers from security firm
                    Group IB
                    <a
                      href="https://www.group-ib.com/blog/cve-2023-38831-winrar-zero-day/"
                      >reported Wednesday</a
                    >. The attackers have been using the vulnerability to
                    remotely execute code that installs malware from families,
                    including DarkMe, GuLoader, and Remcos RAT.

                    From there, the criminals withdraw money from broker
                    accounts. The total amount of financial losses and total
                    number of victims infected is unknown, although Group-IB
                    said it has tracked at least 130 individuals known to have
                    been compromised. WinRAR developers fixed the vulnerability,
                    tracked as CVE-2023-38831, earlier this month.

                    [...] WinRAR has more than 500 million users who rely on the
                    program to compress large files to make them more manageable
                    and quicker to upload and download. It's not uncommon for
                    people to immediately decompress the resulting ZIP files
                    without inspecting them first. Even when people attempt to
                    examine them for malice, antivirus software often has
                    trouble peering into the compressed data to identify
                    malicious code.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The malicious ZIP archives Group-IB found were posted on
                    public forums used by traders to swap information and
                    discuss topics related to cryptocurrencies and other
                    securities. In most cases, the malicious ZIPs were attached
                    to forum posts. In other cases, they were distributed on the
                    file storage site catbox[.]moe. Group-IB identified eight
                    popular trading forums used to spread the files.

                    US government regulators reportedly tried to come to an
                    agreement with TikTok to prevent banning the app that would
                    have granted the federal government vast powers over the
                    app. That’s according to a draft of a deal between TikTok
                    and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States
                    (CFIUS)
                    <a

                      >obtained by Forbes</a
                    >, a contract that would have given multiple US agencies
                    unprecedented access into the app’s records and operations.
                    Many of the concessions the government asked of TikTok look
                    eerily similar to the surveillance tactics critics have
                    accused Chinese officials of abusing. To allay fears the
                    short-form video app could be used as a Chinese surveillance
                    tool, the federal government nearly transformed it into an
                    American one instead.

                    Department of Justice and Department of Defense far more
                    access to TikTok’s operations than that of any other social
                    media company. The agreement would let agencies examine
                    TikTok’s US facilities, records, and servers with minimal
                    prior notice and veto the hiring of any executive involved
                    with leading TikTok US data security organization. It would
                    also let US agencies block changes to the app’s terms of
                    service in the US and order the company to subject itself to
                    various audits, all on TikTok’s dime, per Forbes. In extreme
                    cases, the agreement would allow government organizations to
                    demand TikTok temporarily shut off functioning in the US.

                    CFIUS did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for
                    comment. TikTok would not confirm or deny the draft
                    agreement but instead sent us this statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “As has been widely reported, we’ve been working with CFIUS
                    for well over a year to implement a national security
                    agreement and have invested significant resources in
                    implementing a firewall to isolate U.S. user data,” a TikTok
                    spokesperson said. “Today, all new protected U.S. user data
                    is stored in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in the U.S.
                    with tightly controlled and monitored gateways. We are doing
                    more than any peer company to safeguard U.S. national
                    security interests.”

                  <p>
                    Have you ever been told that the company's data on laptops
                    is protected thanks to BitLocker? Well it turns out that
                    this depends on BitLocker's configuration...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The BitLocker partition is encrypted using the Full Volume
                    Encryption Key (FVEK). The FVEK itself is encrypted using
                    the Volume Master Key (VMK) and stored on the disk, next to
                    the encrypted data. This permits key rotations without
                    re-encrypting the whole disk.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The VMK is stored in the TPM. Thus the disk can only be
                    decrypted when booted from this computer (there is a
                    recovery mechanism in Active Directory though).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In order to decrypt the disk, the CPU will ask that the TPM
                    sends the VMK over the SPI bus.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The vulnerability should be obvious: at some point in the
                    boot process, the VMK transits unencrypted between the TPM
                    and the CPU. This means that it can be captured and used to
                    decrypt the disk.

                  <p>
                    Since the 17th century, when Isaac Newton and Christiaan
                    Huygens first debated the nature of light, scientists have
                    been puzzling over whether light is best viewed as a wave or
                    a particle—or perhaps, at the quantum level, even both at
                    once. Now, researchers at Stevens Institute of Technology
                    have revealed a new connection between the two perspectives,
                    using a 350-year-old mechanical theorem—ordinarily used to
                    describe the movement of large, physical objects like
                    pendulums and planets—to explain some of the most complex
                    behaviors of light waves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The work, led by Xiaofeng Qian, assistant professor of
                    physics at Stevens and reported in the August 17 online
                    issue of Physical Review Research, also proves for the first
                    time that a light wave's degree of non-quantum entanglement
                    exists in a direct and complementary relationship with its
                    degree of polarization. As one rises, the other falls,
                    enabling the level of entanglement to be inferred directly
                    from the level of polarization, and vice versa. This means
                    that hard-to-measure
                    <a href="https://phys.org/tags/optical+properties/"
                      >optical properties</a
                    >
                    such as amplitudes, phases and correlations—perhaps even
                    these of quantum wave systems—can be deduced from something
                    a lot easier to measure:

                      >light intensity</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We've known for over a century that light sometimes behaves
                    like a wave, and sometimes like a particle, but reconciling
                    those two frameworks has proven extremely difficult," said
                    Qian "Our work doesn't solve that problem—but it does show
                    that there are profound connections between wave and
                    particle concepts not just at the
                    <a href="https://phys.org/tags/quantum+level/"
                      >quantum level</a
                    >, but at the level of classical light-waves and point-mass
                    systems."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Qian's team used a mechanical theorem, originally developed
                    by Huygens in a 1673 book on pendulums, that explains how
                    the energy required to rotate an object varies depending on
                    the object's mass and the axis around which it turns. "This
                    is a well-established mechanical theorem that explains the
                    workings of physical systems like clocks or
                    <a href="https://phys.org/tags/prosthetic+limbs/"
                      >prosthetic limbs</a
                    >," Qian explained. "But we were able to show that it can
                    offer new insights into how light works, too."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Essentially, we found a way to translate an optical
                    system so we could visualize it as a mechanical system, then
                    describe it using well-established physical equations,"
                    explained Qian.

                in Oslo, Norway at Kulturkirken Jakob (St. James Church of
                Culture) where the actor and film director Liv Ullmann read the
                scripture passages. Chris Hedges is a Pulitzer Prize–winning
                journalist who has worked for many years at the
                <i>New York Times</i>, NPR, and several other publications. In
                his sermon he expounds on the long-standing problem of speaking
                truth to power.

                    Julian exposed the truth. He exposed it over and over and
                    over until there was no question of the endemic illegality,
                    corruption and mendacity that defines the global ruling
                    class And for these truths they came after Julian, as they
                    have come after all who dared rip back the veil on power.
                    "Red Rosa now has vanished too," Bertolt Brecht wrote after
                    the German socialist Rosa Luxemburg was murdered. "She told
                    the poor what life is about, And so the rich have rubbed her

                    war, financial speculation and internal surveillance are the
                    only real business of the state, where even habeas corpus no
                    longer exists, where we, as citizens, are nothing more than
                    commodities to corporate systems of power, ones to be used,
                    fleeced and discarded.

                Given the massive quantities of disinformation spread over a
                longer period of time against Julian Assange, and the media
                blackout on coverage of his case and how it effects journalism
                as a whole, this is a difficult case to find a concise and
                accurate summary to link to. The bottom line is that, regardless
                of what one thinks (or has been told to think) about Julian
                Assange, the case hinges on factors which will determine whether
                or not there is a future for investigative reporting.

                    [...] The bill has been praised by right-to-repair activists
                    like iFixit, who says the bill goes further than
                    right-to-repair laws passed in

                      >New York</a
                    >. Minnesota's law was considered the most all-encompassing
                    right-to-repair legislation yet. Some activists, though,
                    lamented that companies aren't required to sell parts and
                    tools for devices not actively sold. California's bill,
                    however, keeps vendors on the hook for three years after the
                    last date of manufacture if the product is $50 to $99.99 and
                    seven years if it's over $99.99.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The bill also allows a city, county, or state to bring a
                    related case to superior court rather than only a state
                    attorney general, as noted by iFixit's

                    difficult to spot, more capable of duping users, and more
                    effective at gaming the algorithms used to prioritize
                    content on social media.

                    "It tricks both the platform and the users," Menczer says of
                    the ChatGPT-powered botnet. And, if a social media algorithm
                    spots that a post has a lot of engagement—even if that
                    engagement is from other bot accounts—it will show the post
                    to more people. "That's exactly why these bots are behaving
                    the way they do," Menczer says. And governments looking to
                    wage disinformation campaigns are most likely already
                    developing or deploying such tools, he adds.

                    Menczer says that malicious bots appear to have become far
                    more common since Elon Musk took over what was then known as
                    Twitter, despite the tech mogul's promise

                    Someone at X apparently took down the Fox8 botnet after
                    Menczer and Yang published their paper in July. Menczer's
                    group used to alert Twitter of new findings on the platform,
                    but they no longer do that with X. "They are not really
                    responsive," Menczer says. "They don't really have the

                    of the World Summit of the Information Society (WSIS) – a UN
                    event staged in 2003 and 2005 that defined a
                    multi-stakeholder internet governance framework. 2015's

                    today's governance models – that include the technical
                    community as a distinct stakeholder – have worked.

                    continue to play its critical roles in the future of the
                    internet, and it behooves the UN to recognize this reality

                    A prototype satellite built to test a deployable drag sail
                    to de-orbit satellites appears to have fulfilled its
                    purpose, burning up on re-entry earlier this month after
                    spending just 445 days in orbit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    SBUDNIC, an acronym chosen to be a play on "Sputnik," was
                    put together by students at Brown University, Rhode Island,
                    using low-cost off-the-shelf commercial components. The
                    CubeSat design featured a drag sail made from Kapton
                    polyimide film, and with structural supports of thin
                    aluminum tubing, which deployed once the satellite was in
                    orbit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The project
                    <a
                      href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2023-08-18/sbudnic-reentry"
                      >appears to have been successful</a
                    >
                    in this respect, according to tracking data the team
                    obtained from US Space Command. It indicated that SBUDNIC
                    was about 470 kilometers (292 miles) above the Earth in
                    early March, while other comparably sized satellites
                    deployed to a similar orbit as part of the same mission were
                    still at altitudes of 500 kilometers (310 miles) or more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Previous predictions had suggested that the drag
                    device would reduce the orbital lifetime of SBUDNIC from
                    over 20 years to as few as 6.5 years, but in reality it was
                    brought down in about a year and a quarter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Rather than taking junk out of space after it becomes
                    a problem, we have this $30 drag device you can just throw
                    onto satellites and radically reduce how long they're in
                    space," Ganjikunta said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, this requires future satellites to be designed to
                    have a similar mechanism built in, and so does not help to
                    address existing space junk, but every little presumably
                    helps.

                    SBUDNIC was a 3U CubeSat, meaning it was effectively the
                    size of three 10cm cubes joined together. It was based
                    around a $10 Arduino system plus 65 AA lithium batteries and
                    included a variety of 3D-printed parts produced with
                    consumer-grade printers.

                    Four nonprofit groups seeking to protect kids' privacy
                    online asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to
                    investigate YouTube today, after back-to-back reports
                    allegedly showed that YouTube is still targeting
                    personalized ads on videos "made for kids."

                  <p>

                    said, and potentially intervene. Otherwise, it's possible
                    that YouTube could continue to allegedly harvest data on
                    millions of kids, seemingly in violation of the Children's
                    Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the FTC Act.

                    alleging YouTube's noncompliance with federal laws came last
                    week from Adalytics and was quickly corroborated by research
                    from Fairplay, one of the groups behind the FTC letter,

                    really blocking all personalized ads from appearing in
                    children's channels, as YouTube said it was. Both found that
                    "Google and YouTube permit and report on behavioral ad
                    targeting on 'made-for-kids' videos, even though neither

                    of how advertising works on made-for-kids content."<br /><br />[...]
                    But in their letter, child advocates told FTC Chair Lina
                    Khan that they have "serious questions" about whether Google
                    is being honest about ad targeting. After running targeted
                    ad campaigns, Fairplay reported that YouTube placed its
                    behavioral ads on children's channels 1,446 times. If
                    YouTube was operating in compliance with COPPA as it
                    claimed, Fairplay said that these campaigns would have
                    resulted in zero ad placements.

                    Roughly a century before the Inca empire came to power in
                    A.D. 1400, blasts of human-produced thunder may have rumbled
                    off a ridge high in the Andes Mountains.

                    New evidence indicates that people who lived there around
                    700 years ago stomped rhythmically on a special dance floor
                    that amplified their pounding into a thunderous boom as they
                    worshipped a thunder god.

                    Excavations at a high-altitude site in Peru called Viejo
                    Sangayaico have revealed how members of a regional farming
                    and herding group, the Chocorvos, constructed this
                    reverberating platform, says archaeologist Kevin Lane of the
                    University of Buenos Aires. Different layers of soil, ash
                    and guano created a floor that absorbed shocks while
                    emitting resonant sounds when people stomped on it. This

                    feet, Lane reports in the September
                    <em>Journal of Anthropological Archaeology</em>.

                    [...] His team acoustically tested the platform by stomping
                    on it one at a time and in groups of two to four while
                    measuring the noise produced. The same was done while a
                    circle of four people stomp-danced across the platform.

                  <p>
                    The resulting sounds ranged in intensity from 60 to 80
                    decibels, roughly equivalent to between a loud conversation
                    and a noisy restaurant, Lane says. Larger groups of
                    Chocorvos dancers, possibly accompanied by singing and

                    similar to Prosciutto di Parma. A smartphone can be used to

                    use blockchain technology to authenticate data that can
                    trace the cheese as far back as the producer of the milk
                    used. The chips have been in advanced testing on more than
                    100,000 Parmigiano wheels for more than a year. The
                    consortium of producers wants to be sure the chips can stand
                    up to Parmigiano's aging requirement, which is a minimum of
                    one year and can exceed three years for some varieties.

                  <p>
                    Drugmaker Merck KGaA will soon begin using the chips, which
                    are also being tested in the automotive industry to
                    guarantee the authenticity of car parts. The chips could
                    eventually be used on livestock, crops or medicine stored in
                    liquid nitrogen.

                    mock-up of stomach acid without leaking any dangerous
                    material. Eibon went a step further, eating one without
                    suffering any ill effects, but he isn't touting that lest
                    p-Chip face accusations it is tracking people, something
                    that isn't possible because the chips can't be read remotely
                    and can't be read once they are ingested.

                Ötzi the Iceman is one of the most well-studied individuals in
                human history, but there always seems to be more to learn about
                him. A new genomic study has now found that he didn't look the
                way previous studies had imagined him – instead he was bald, his
                skin was darker, and he had an ancestry that was far more exotic
                and isolated than previously thought.
              </p>
              <p>
                In September 1991, two hikers discovered a human body in the
                Alps near the Austria and Italy border. At first they assumed
                they'd stumbled on an unlucky modern mountaineer, but on closer,
                scientific investigation, it was determined that the chap had
                died about 5,300 years ago. In the three decades since his
                discovery, Ötzi has been studied extensively, with scientists
                able to figure out what he ate, how he dressed, how he lived and
                how he died.
              </p>
              <p>
                His full genome was published in 2012, allowing scientists to
                reconstruct an image of what he might have looked like. From
                that data, Ötzi was imagined as a fairly light-skinned man with
                a bushy beard, a thick head of unkempt hair, deep-set eyes and
                wrinkled skin beyond his 45 years of life. But a new study,
                using more comprehensive genomic analysis techniques, upends
                much of that picture.

                    pull, the speed of light, and the mass of an electron, don't
                    have any underlying explanation for why they have the values
                    they do. For each aspect like this, a fundamental constant
                    is required to "lock in" the specific value that we observe
                    these properties take on in our Universe. All told, we need
                    26 fundamental constants to explain the known Universe: the
                    Standard Model plus gravity. But even with that, some

                    [...] In the Friday ruling on copyright of an AI-generated
                    image, Judge Howell wrote that Thaler attempted "to
                    complicate the issues presented by devoting a substantial
                    portion of his briefing to the viability of various legal
                    theories under which a copyright in the computer's work
                    would transfer to him, as the computer's owner; for example,
                    by operation of common law property principles or the
                    work-for-hire doctrine." But these arguments "put the cart
                    before the horse" because they only address "<em
                      >to whom</em
                    >
                    a valid copyright should have been registered," not whether
                    a copyright can be granted for a work generated without
                    human involvement, Howell wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "United States copyright law protects only works of human
                    creation," Howell wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Thaler pointed out that the Copyright Act does not
                    define the word "author." But Howell wrote that the law's
                    "'authorship' requirement as presumptively being
                    <em>human</em> rests on centuries of settled understanding."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The US Constitution conceived of copyrights and
                    patents "as forms of property that the government was
                    established to protect, and it was understood that
                    recognizing exclusive rights in that property would further
                    the public good by incentivizing individuals to create and
                    invent... Non-human actors need no incentivization with the
                    promise of exclusive rights under United States law, and
                    copyright was therefore not designed to reach them."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Copyright has never stretched far enough "to protect works
                    generated by new forms of technology operating absent any
                    guiding human hand, as plaintiff urges here. Human
                    authorship is a bedrock requirement of copyright," Howell
                    wrote.

                    legal questions "regarding how much human input is necessary
                    to qualify the user of an AI system as an 'author' of a
                    generated work" and "how to assess the originality of
                    AI-generated works where the systems may have been trained
                    on unknown pre-existing works," Howell wrote. But Thaler's
                    case "is not nearly so complex."

                    Since then, Meta has clammed up hard about what goes into
                    its language models. Last month, Meta released a

                      >newer, bigger language model called LlaMA 2</a
                    >. This time, Meta worked with Microsoft to add 40% more
                    data than its previous model, though in its
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09288.pdf"

                    the company was much more hesitant to outright state what
                    data its latest LM was trained on. The only reference to its
                    training data was that it’s “a new mix of publicly available
                    online data.” As the friction between AI and copyright grows
                    hotter, companies are less and less likely to share exactly
                    what’s contained in the morass of AI training data.

                    infringement "of works by some of the greatest artists of

                    Recordings, Capitol Records, Concord Bicycle Assets, CMGI,
                    Sony Music Entertainment, and Arista Music. It targets the

                    For the Great 78 Project, the Internet Archive partners with
                    recording engineer George Blood— who is also a defendant in
                    the lawsuit—to digitize sound recordings on 78
                    revolutions-per-minute (RPM) records. These early sound
                    recordings are typically of poor quality and were made
                    between 1898 and the late 1950s by using very brittle
                    materials. The goal of the Great 78 Project was to preserve
                    these early recordings so they would not be lost as records
                    break and could continue to be studied as originally
                    recorded.

                    post responding to the record labels' lawsuit, Internet
                    Archive founder Brewster Kahle said that the Internet
                    Archive is currently reviewing the challenge and taking it
                    seriously. However, Kahle characterizes the Great 78 Project
                    as providing "free public access to a largely forgotten but
                    culturally important medium," claiming that "there shouldn't
                    be conflict here."<br />[...]<br />Days after record labels
                    filed their complaint, a

                    was unsealed showing that the Internet Archive had reached a
                    joint agreement with book publishers due to the publishers'
                    legal victory earlier this year. If the judge signs off, the
                    agreement would permanently bar the Internet Archive from
                    lending any unauthorized scans of books when authorized
                    e-book versions exist,
                    <a

                  <p>
                    The Internet Archive would also be barred from profiting
                    from any infringing works.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's unclear how high the damages are in this case, but the
                    agreement includes an all-inclusive "confidential monetary
                    settlement" that "substantially" covers publishers' legal
                    fees and costs, as well as damages and other claims.
                    Previously it was estimated that the case could cost
                    Internet Archive more than $19 million, which

                        I've always liked mathematics; problem solving has
                        always been fun. My saving grace in life is that I was
                        not introduced to computers at an early age. […]
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I went through the university, all the way to the
                        master's level, so I got a good, solid liberal
                        education. I believe it's really important to have a
                        very solid foundation in mathematics, English, and the
                        basic sciences. Then, when you become a graduate
                        student, it's okay to learn as much as you can about
                        computers.

                      <p>
                        If you really want to be successful, being acculturated
                        to the rest of the society and then going into computers
                        is a much more reasonable way to approach the problem.

                Collecting charge from a ribbon of single layer graphene, with a
                pair of diodes at the nanometer scale is a novel approach to

                    We theoretically consider a graphene ripple as a Brownian
                    particle coupled to an energy storage circuit. When circuit
                    and particle are at the same temperature, the second law
                    forbids harvesting energy from the thermal motion of the
                    Brownian particle, even if the circuit contains a rectifying
                    diode. However, when the circuit contains a junction
                    followed by two diodes wired in opposition, the approach to
                    equilibrium may become ultraslow. Detailed balance is
                    temporarily broken as current flows between the two diodes
                    and charges storage capacitors. The energy harvested by each
                    capacitor comes from the thermal bath of the diodes while
                    the system obeys the first and second laws of
                    thermodynamics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The scientists discovered that when the storage
                    capacitors have an initial charge of zero, the circuit draws
                    power from the thermal environment to charge them. The team
                    then demonstrated that the system satisfies both the first
                    and second laws of thermodynamics throughout the charging
                    process. They also found that larger storage capacitors
                    yield more stored charge and that a smaller graphene
                    capacitance provides both a higher initial rate of charging
                    and a longer time to discharge. These characteristics are
                    important because they allow time to disconnect the storage
                    capacitors from the energy harvesting circuit before the net
                    charge is lost.

                    significantly. OMGVflash and NVflashk have effectively
                    cracked a security feature on recent Nvidia GPUs, allowing
                    extreme overclockers to flash new vBIOS files to graphics
                    cards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    About a decade ago, Nvidia locked down its GPUs. Graphics
                    cards are governed by a vBIOS, which specifies such things
                    as the power limit of the GPU, maximum clock speed, and
                    parameters like when the GPU will shut down due to thermals.
                    Prior to Nvidia's GeForce 900-series GPUs, extreme
                    overclockers could flash a new vBIOS onto the GPU to achieve
                    higher levels of performance. But Nvidia locked this
                    functionality with an on-chip security processor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ability is returning with the new tools. Both were
                    developed by members of the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techpowerup.com/312631/nvidia-bios-signature-lock-broken-vbios-modding-and-crossflash-enabled-by-groundbreaking-new-tools"
                      >TechPowerUp</a

                    forums independently, and the outlet says it has
                    "hand-inspected the binary code" to ensure they're free of
                    viruses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Outside of tinkering, the tools can boost performance on
                    cheaper graphics cards. Many brands sell a model close to
                    list price and an overclocked model for slightly more. The
                    only difference between the cards, in most cases, is the
                    vBIOS file. The tools allow for cross-flashing as well,
                    allowing you to flash a vBIOS from one vendor onto the card
                    of a different vendor.

                    When one thinks of movie reviews, one might see them as
                    harbingers of success or failure at the box office. Some
                    researchers have previously found that both positive and
                    negative reviews correlate to box office revenues, and the
                    effect of negative reviews diminishes over time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, researchers at the University of California, Davis,
                    suggest that is not the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers analyzed pre-release commentary and opening
                    weekend box office revenue, turning the impact of movie
                    reviews on its head and revealing an unexpected harbinger of
                    failure phenomenon in the movie industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The study analyzed a plethora of pre-release movie
                    reviews penned by film critics on Rotten Tomatoes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers wanted to see if they could predict a movie's
                    success based on these reviews. As it turned out, the
                    so-called harbingers of failure did exist.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Interestingly, when these critics penned positive
                    pre-release reviews, they signaled that the movie would be a
                    flop," said Loupos. "Conversely, their negative reviews
                    hinted towards the film being a success. The stronger the
                    sentiment in either direction, the stronger the predictive
                    signal."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] What's more surprising, this pattern persisted even
                    with top critics. Expertise, it seems, does not always lead
                    to accurate predictions, Loupos said. "This surprising
                    outcome challenges the prevailing belief that positive
                    reviews equate to better box office revenues," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Our fresh perspective on the role of critics'
                    personalities opens up new avenues in our understanding of
                    the film review space," Loupos remarked. "It's an important
                    acknowledgment that the movie industry is a puzzle of
                    complexity and unpredictability."

                    [...] This study demonstrates that the perceived meaning of
                    manual labor (MML) – a novel concept introduced by the
                    researchers – is key to predicting the adoption of
                    autonomous products. Poletti says that "Consumers with a
                    high MML tend to resist the delegation of manual tasks to
                    autonomous products, irrespective of whether these tasks are
                    central to one's identity or not. Marketers can start by
                    segmenting consumers into high and low MML consumers."
                    Unlike other personality variables that can only be reliably
                    measured using complex psychometric scales, the extent of
                    consumers' MML might be assessed simply by observing their
                    behavioral characteristics, such as whether consumers tend
                    to do the dishes by hand, whether they prefer a manual car
                    transmission, or what type of activities and hobbies they
                    pursue. Activities like woodworking, cookery, painting, and
                    fishing are likely predictors of high MML. Similarly,
                    companies can measure likes on social media for specific
                    activities and hobbies that involve manual labor. Finally,
                    practitioners can ask consumers to rate the degree to which
                    manual versus cognitive tasks are meaningful to them. Having
                    segmented consumers according to their MML, marketers can
                    better target and focus their messages and efforts.

                    technology being explored as an alternative to diesel
                    generators. As we reported last fall, Equinix is already

                    "We believe that this location is ideal for the logistics of
                    hydrogen shipping and distribution," Hewitt said.

                    If all this sounds too good to be true, that's because
                    there's a lot that needs to happen before GEP's vision can
                    become a reality. This is part of the reason the two
                    companies are hedging their bets on datacenters from the get
                    go, Hewitt explained. "Let's say that the nuclear power part
                    of it kind of falls apart in terms of an opportunity; we
                    still have a datacenter site that makes money and has a
                    great client."

                  <p>
                    Of course if SMRs don't pan out, clean hydrogen generation
                    at the site is unlikely to either.

                    The FIDO2 industry standard adopted five years ago provides
                    the most secure known way to log in to websites because it
                    doesn't rely on passwords and has the most secure form of 
                    built-in two-factor authentication. Like many existing
                    security schemes today, though, FIDO faces an ominous if
                    distant threat from quantum computing, which one day will
                    cause the currently rock-solid cryptography the standard
                    uses to completely crumble.

                    Over the past decade, mathematicians and engineers have
                    scrambled to head off this cryptopocalypse with the advent
                    of PQC—short for post-quantum cryptography—a class of
                    encryption that uses algorithms resistant to
                    quantum-computing attacks. This week, researchers from
                    Google announced the

                    of the first implementation of quantum-resistant encryption
                    for use in the type of security keys that are the basic
                    building blocks of FIDO2.

                  <p>
                    The best known implementation of FIDO2 is the passwordless
                    form of authentication: passkeys. So far, there are no known
                    ways passkeys can be defeated in credential phishing
                    attacks. Dozens of sites and services now allow users to log
                    in using passkeys, which use cryptographic keys stored in
                    security keys, smartphones, and other devices.

                    The Intel 8086 processor started the x86 architecture that
                    is still extensively used today. The 8086 has some quirky
                    characteristics: it is little-endian, has a parity flag, and
                    uses explicit I/O instructions instead of just memory-mapped
                    I/O. It has four 16-bit registers that can be split into
                    8-bit registers, but only one that can be used for memory
                    indexing. Surprisingly, the reason for these characteristics
                    and more is compatibility with a computer dating back before
                    the creation of the microprocessor: the Datapoint 2200, a
                    minicomputer with a processor built out of TTL chips. In
                    this blog post, I'll look in detail at how the Datapoint
                    2200 led to the architecture of Intel's modern processors,
                    step by step through the 8008, 8080, and 8086 processors.
                  </p>
                  <p>The Datapoint 2200</p>
                  <p>
                    In the late 1960s, 80-column IBM punch cards were the
                    primary way of entering data into computers, although CRT
                    terminals were growing in popularity. The Datapoint 2200 was
                    designed as a low-cost terminal that could replace a
                    keypunch, with a squat CRT display the size of a punch card.
                    By putting some processing power into the Datapoint 2200, it
                    could perform data validation and other tasks, making data
                    entry more efficient. Even though the Datapoint 2200 was
                    typically used as an intelligent terminal, it was really a
                    desktop minicomputer with a "unique combination of powerful
                    computer, display, and dual cassette drives." Although now
                    mostly forgotten, the Datapoint 2200 was the origin of the
                    8-bit microprocessor, as I'll explain below.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The memory storage of the Datapoint 2200 had a large impact
                    on its architecture and thus the architecture of today's
                    computers. In the 1960s and early 1970s, magnetic core
                    memory was the dominant form of computer storage. It
                    consisted of tiny ferrite rings, threaded into grids, with
                    each ring storing one bit. Magnetic core storage was bulky
                    and relatively expensive, though.

                    New theoretical research by Michael Wondrak, Walter van
                    Suijlekom and Heino Falcke of Radboud University has shown
                    that Stephen Hawking was right about black holes, although
                    not completely. Due to Hawking radiation, black holes will
                    eventually evaporate, but the event horizon is not as
                    crucial as has been believed. Gravity and the curvature of
                    spacetime cause this radiation too. This means that all
                    large objects in the universe, like the remnants of stars,
                    will eventually evaporate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Van Suijlekom: 'We show that far beyond a black hole
                    the curvature of spacetime plays a big role in creating
                    radiation. The particles are already separated there by the
                    tidal forces of the gravitational field.' Whereas it was
                    previously thought that no radiation was possible without
                    the event horizon, this study shows that this horizon is not
                    necessary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Falcke: 'That means that objects without an event horizon,
                    such as the remnants of dead stars and other large objects
                    in the universe, also have this sort of radiation. And,
                    after a very long period, that would lead to everything in
                    the universe eventually evaporating, just like black holes.
                    This changes not only our understanding of Hawking radiation
                    but also our view of the universe and its future.'

                    A recently discovered security vulnerability impacting
                    select Intel CPUs released between 2015 and 2019 has been
                    patched thanks to a new software-level microcode update.
                    Unfortunately, early testing has revealed some pretty
                    significant performance penalties introduced by the
                    mitigation effort.

                Zinc-air batteries have emerged as a better alternative to
                lithium in a recent Edith Cowan University (ECU) study into the
                advancement of sustainable battery systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                ECU's Dr. Muhammad Rizwan Azhar led the project which discovered
                lithium-ion batteries, although a popular choice for electric
                vehicles around the world, face limitations related to cost,
                finite resources, and safety concerns. The work is published in
                the journal EcoMat.<br />...<br />A zinc–air battery consists of
                a zinc negative electrode and an air positive electrode.<br />...<br />ECU's
                breakthrough has enabled engineers to use a combination of new
                materials, such as carbon, cheaper iron and cobalt based
                minerals to redesign zinc-air batteries.<br />"The new design
                has been so efficient it suppressed the internal resistance of
                batteries, and their voltage was close to the theoretical
                voltage which resulted in a high peak power density and
                ultra-long stability," Dr. Azhar said.

                    [...] In contrast to the Defcon subway-hacking blowup of
                    2008—and in a sign of how far companies and government
                    agencies have come in their relationship with the
                    cybersecurity community—the four hackers say the MBTA didn't
                    threaten to sue them or try to block their Defcon talk.
                    Instead, it invited them to the transit authority
                    headquarters earlier this year to deliver a presentation on
                    the vulnerabilities they'd found. Then the MBTA politely
                    asked that they obscure part of their technique to make it
                    harder for other hackers to replicate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The hackers say the MBTA hasn't actually fixed the
                    vulnerabilities they discovered and instead appears to be
                    waiting for an entirely new subway card system that it plans
                    to roll out in 2025. When WIRED reached out to the MBTA, its
                    director of communications, Joe Pesaturo, responded in a
                    statement that "the MBTA was pleased that the students
                    reached out and worked collaboratively with the fare
                    collection team."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] So are all four of them using their
                    CharlieCard-hacking technique to roam the Boston subway
                    system for free? "No comment."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For now, the hacker team is just happy to be able to give
                    their talk without the heavy-handed censorship that the MBTA
                    attempted with its lawsuit 15 years ago. Harris argues that
                    the MBTA likely learned its lesson from that approach, which
                    only drew attention to the hackers' findings. "It's great
                    that they're not doing that now—that they're not shooting
                    themselves in the foot. And it's a lot less stressful for
                    everyone," Harris says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He's also glad, on the other hand, that the MBTA took such a
                    hardline approach to the 2008 talk that it got his attention
                    and kickstarted the group's research almost a decade and a
                    half later. "If they hadn't done that," Harris says, "we
                    wouldn't be here."

                In 2020 Microsoft laid off dozens of journalists, in a move to
                rely on artificial intelligence. Those journalists were
                responsible for selecting content for Microsoft platforms,
                including MSN and the Edge browser. A recent tourism article now
                reminds us of that earlier business decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                Published last week and titled "Headed to Ottawa? Here's what
                you shouldn't miss!" the article listed 15 must-see attractions
                for visitors to the Canadian capital. Microsoft has since
                removed the article that advised tourists to visit the
                "beautiful" Ottawa Food Bank on an empty stomach. That appears
                to be an out-of-context rewrite of a paragraph on the food
                bank's website. "Life is challenging enough," it says. "Imagine
                facing it on an empty stomach."
              </p>
              <p>
                The remainder of the must-see list was rife with errors. It
                featured a photo of the Rideau River in an entry about the
                Rideau Canal, and a photo of the Rideau Canal in an entry about
                Parc Omega near Montebello, Quebec. It advised tourists to enjoy
                the pristine grass of "Parliament Hills."
              </p>
              <p>
                The article carried the byline "Microsoft Travel." There is
                nothing on the page that identifies it as the product of AI.
                Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment
                on how the article was generated. While now removed, it is still
                available via the Internet Archive.<br /><a

                    U.S. spy agencies will share more intelligence with U.S.
                    companies, nongovernmental organizations and academia under
                    a new strategy released this week that acknowledges concerns
                    over new threats, such as another pandemic and increasing
                    cyberattacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The National Intelligence Strategy, which sets broad goals
                    for the sprawling U.S. intelligence community, says that spy
                    agencies must reach beyond the traditional walls of secrecy
                    and partner with outside groups to detect and deter
                    supply-chain disruptions, infectious diseases and other
                    growing transnational threats.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The intelligence community "must rethink its approach to
                    exchanging information and insights," the strategy says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The U.S. government in recent years has begun sharing vast
                    amounts of cyber-threat intelligence with U.S. companies,
                    utilities and others who are often the main targets of
                    foreign hackers, as well as information on foreign-influence
                    operations with social-media companies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Illustrating the changing threats, a senior U.S.
                    official said that the daily intelligence briefing prepared
                    for President Biden and his top advisers—once dominated by
                    terrorism and the Middle East—now regularly covers topics as
                    varied as China's artificial-intelligence work, the
                    geopolitical impacts of climate change, and semiconductor
                    chips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The 16-page document, which contains no budget or
                    program details, also says spy agencies must support the
                    U.S. in its competition with authoritarian governments such
                    as China and Russia, particularly in technological arenas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On transnational threats such as financial crises, narcotics
                    trafficking, supply-chain disruption and infectious
                    diseases, the document calls on intelligence agencies to
                    strengthen their internal capabilities to warn U.S.
                    policymakers of looming threats.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The emphasis on greater intelligence sharing is part
                    of a broader trend toward declassification that the Biden
                    administration has pursued. The United States has released
                    unprecedented levels of formerly secret intelligence to warn
                    of Russia's plans in Ukraine and its quest for weapons from
                    China, Iran and North Korea.

                    But although the new study's "approach is quite
                    interesting," the fertility link poses a new puzzle, says
                    geneticist Tábita Hünemeier at the University of São Paulo.
                    The fertility boost is "so great" that natural selection
                    should have led to a much higher frequency of
                    <em>APOE4</em> in the Tsimané, she suggests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Alzheimer's and heart disease rates are low even among older
                    Tsimané people, perhaps because of their active lifestyle,
                    Trumble's group has reported. But he says
                    <em>APOE4</em> could still have detrimental effects that
                    balance the benefits—it may reduce fertility in men, for
                    example, or decrease child survival. "Our next step is to
                    figure out whether there are disadvantages at certain life
                    stages," he says.

                    are plotting for mankind’s return to the lunar surface over
                    the next decade. Unlike the days of Apollo, the modern-day
                    race to the Moon involves establishing a sustainable
                    presence and a thriving economy on and around Earth’s
                    natural satellite.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an attempt to guide ongoing efforts in establishing a
                    lunar infrastructure, the Defense Advanced Research Projects
                    Agency (DARPA) kicked off a seven-month study dedicated to
                    developing an analytical framework for scientific and
                    commercial activity on the Moon. Through the 10-Year Lunar
                    Architecture, or LunA-10, study, DARPA is seeking ideas for
                    technology and infrastructure concepts that could help build
                    a Moon-based economy within the next decade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “A large paradigm shift is coming in the next 10 years for
                    the lunar economy,” Michael Nayak, program manager at
                    DARPA’s Strategic Technology Office, said in a
                    <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2023-08-15"
                      >statement</a
                    >. “To get to a turning point faster, LunA-10 uniquely aims
                    to identify solutions that can enable multi-mission lunar
                    systems – imagine a wireless power station that can also
                    provide comms and navigation in its beam.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Luna-10 will select a group of companies that have an
                    idea for lunar services, allowing them to work together to
                    develop an integrated system for lunar communication,
                    energy, transmission or other building blocks necessary to
                    create a future economy on the Moon. The participating
                    companies will be announced in October 2023, with the final
                    report due by June 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    DARPA, however, will not fund the construction or
                    transportation of any of the concepts developed as part of
                    the study. Instead, the agency will provide its “economic
                    expertise to all LunA-10 teams to help analyze and validate
                    definitions of a critical mass to create a thriving,
                    survivable lunar economy,” DARPA wrote in its statement.

                    Russia's unmanned Luna-25 spacecraft has crashed into the
                    Moon after spinning out of control, officials say.
                  </p>
                  <p>It was Russia's first Moon mission in almost 50 years.</p>
                  <p>
                    The craft was due to be the first ever to land on the Moon's
                    south pole, but failed after encountering problems as it
                    moved into its pre-landing orbit.

                    [...] Roscosmos, Russia's state space corporation, said on
                    Sunday morning that it had lost contact with the Luna-25
                    shortly after 14:57pm (11:57 GMT) on Saturday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Preliminary findings showed that the 800kg lander had
                    "ceased to exist as a result of a collision with the surface
                    of the Moon", it said in a statement.

                    ChatGPT, OpenAI's fabulating chatbot, produces wrong answers
                    to software programming questions more than half the time,
                    according to a study from Purdue University. That said, the
                    bot was convincing enough to fool a third of participants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Purdue team analyzed ChatGPT's answers to 517 Stack
                    Overflow questions to assess the correctness, consistency,
                    comprehensiveness, and conciseness of ChatGPT's answers. The
                    US academics also conducted linguistic and sentiment
                    analysis of the answers, and questioned a dozen volunteer
                    participants on the results generated by the model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our analysis shows that 52 percent of ChatGPT answers are
                    incorrect and 77 percent are verbose," the team's paper
                    concluded. "Nonetheless, ChatGPT answers are still preferred
                    39.34 percent of the time due to their comprehensiveness and
                    well-articulated language style." Among the set of preferred
                    ChatGPT answers, 77 percent were wrong.

                  <p>
                    OpenAI on the ChatGPT website acknowledges its software "may
                    produce inaccurate information about people, places, or
                    facts." We've asked the lab if it has any comment about the
                    Purdue study.

                    is titled, "Who Answers It Better? An In-Depth Analysis of
                    ChatGPT and Stack Overflow Answers to Software Engineering
                    Questions." It was written by researchers Samia Kabir, David
                    Udo-Imeh, Bonan Kou, and assistant professor Tianyi Zhang.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "During our study, we observed that only when the error in
                    the ChatGPT answer is obvious, users can identify the
                    error," their paper stated. "However, when the error is not
                    readily verifiable or requires external IDE or
                    documentation, users often fail to identify the
                    incorrectness or underestimate the degree of error in the
                    answer."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even when the answer has a glaring error, the paper stated,
                    two out of the 12 participants still marked the response
                    preferred. The paper attributes this to ChatGPT's pleasant,
                    authoritative style.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "From semi-structured interviews, it is apparent that polite
                    language, articulated and text-book style answers,
                    comprehensiveness, and affiliation in answers make
                    completely wrong answers seem correct," the paper explained.

                    A new study finds a chemical formed when we digest a widely
                    used sweetener is "genotoxic," meaning it breaks up DNA. The
                    chemical is also found in trace amounts in the sweetener
                    itself, and the finding raises questions about how the
                    sweetener may contribute to health problems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At issue is sucralose, a widely used artificial sweetener.
                    Previous work by the same research team established that
                    several fat-soluble compounds are produced in the gut after
                    sucralose ingestion. One of these compounds is
                    sucralose-6-acetate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our new work establishes that sucralose-6-acetate is
                    genotoxic," says Susan Schiffman, corresponding author of
                    the study and an adjunct professor in the joint department
                    of biomedical engineering at North Carolina State University
                    and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "We
                    also found that trace amounts of sucralose-6-acetate can be
                    found in off-the-shelf sucralose, even before it is consumed
                    and metabolized.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To put this in context, the European Food Safety Authority
                    has a threshold of toxicological concern for all genotoxic
                    substances of 0.15 micrograms per person per day," Schiffman
                    says. "Our work suggests that the trace amounts of
                    sucralose-6-acetate in a single, daily sucralose-sweetened
                    drink exceed that threshold. And that's not even accounting
                    for the amount of sucralose-6-acetate produced as
                    metabolites after people consume sucralose."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "In short, we found that sucralose-6-acetate is
                    genotoxic, and that it effectively broke up DNA in cells
                    that were exposed to the chemical," Schiffman says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This work raises a host of concerns about the
                    potential health effects associated with sucralose and its
                    metabolites. It's time to revisit the safety and regulatory
                    status of sucralose, because the evidence is mounting that
                    it carries significant risks. If nothing else, I encourage
                    people to avoid products containing sucralose. It's
                    something you should not be eating."

                    Software (FOSS) community, the Debian blog remarks, and he
                    continued to work on the OS before the Debian Project
                    organization took over. The free operating system is now
                    aided by volunteers all around the world, with support from
                    users, contributors, developers, and of course sponsors.

                    Debian calls itself the "Universal Operating System," and
                    the system can indeed be found almost everywhere. The OS
                    powers cluster systems, data centers, desktop PCs, embedded
                    systems, IoT devices, laptops, and servers. It can even be

                    The best testament to Debian's ongoing success is, however,
                    the fact that it

                    Debian is the beating "heart" of gLinux Rodete, the Linux OS
                    internally run by Google, it provided a very convenient way
                    (free as "free in beer") to build some of the most massive
                    cloud infrastructures available today (AWS), and of course
                    it was used as the foundation of Ubuntu.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nowadays, Ubuntu Linux formally is the most popular free OS
                    with a 33.9% market share, while Debian gets the second
                    place with a 16% share. And then there's the ginormous
                    Chinese market, where Beijing authorities promoted a program
                    to replace Windows with Linux. Chinese users adopted Kylin,
                    which is an Ubuntu remix, and Uniontech's UOS systems with
                    the end-user Linux Deepin system, which is also based on
                    Debian.

                Estrogen can harm aquatic plants and animals when passed into
                waterways via human and agricultural waste streams. Researchers
                have now developed a new way of removing the hormone from water,
                however, using what's known as "smart rust."
              </p>
              <p>
                Developed by scientists at Germany's University of
                Erlangen-Nuremberg, smart rust takes the form of spherical iron
                oxide (aka rust) nanoparticles that are covered in phosphonic
                acid molecules. The molecules protrude from the surface of the
                spheres like hairs. By binding different compounds to the ends
                of those hairs, it's possible to make them adsorb different
                types of waterborne pollutants.
              </p>
              <p>
                The iron oxide particles themselves are superparamagnetic,
                meaning they're attracted to magnets but not to one another.
                This quality keeps them from clumping together – so they can be
                thoroughly mixed into tainted water – while also making it
                possible to subsequently remove them from that water simply by
                swirling a magnet through the liquid.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] Due to the fact that estrogen molecules consist of a large
                steroid body with a slight negative charge, he coated smart rust
                particles with two types of molecules. One of these has
                particularly long "hairs," while the other is positively
                charged. When combined on the surface of the iron oxide spheres,
                these molecules form multitudes of estrogen-trapping pockets.
              </p>
              <p>
                When tested on water spiked with estradiol, which is the most
                potent type of estrogen, the new form of smart rust successfully
                removed the hormone from that water. Further research will now
                explore how well the technology works in real-world conditions,
                and how many times the particles can be reused.

                    this week alleging that a company that makes price-setting
                    software for apartments and nine of the nation's biggest
                    property managers formed a cartel to artificially inflate
                    rents in violation of federal law.

                  <p>

                    raising concerns that the software, sold by Texas-based
                    RealPage, is potentially pushing rent prices above
                    competitive levels, facilitating price-fixing, or both.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The proposed class-action lawsuit was filed in US District
                    Court in San Diego.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an email, a RealPage representative said that the company
                    "strongly denies the allegations and will vigorously defend
                    against the lawsuit." She declined to comment further,
                    saying the company does not comment on pending litigation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The lawsuit accused the property managers and RealPage
                    of forming "a cartel to artificially inflate the price of
                    and artificially decrease the supply and output of
                    multifamily residential real estate leases from competitive
                    levels."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    RealPage's software uses an algorithm to churn through a
                    trove of data each night to suggest daily prices for
                    available rental units. The software uses not only
                    information about the apartment being priced and the
                    property where it is located, but also private data on what
                    nearby competitors are charging in rents. The software
                    considers actual rents paid to those rivals—not just what
                    they are advertising, the company told ProPublica.

                    Google has been testing several ways to combat users who use
                    ad-blockers on its YouTube video streaming site. One of the
                    first tests informed users that

                      >ad blockers are not allowed on YouTube</a
                    >. The prompt, which blocks access to the site, offers three
                    options to users to react to it. The two prominent ones are
                    to configure the content blocker to allow ads on YouTube or
                    to subscribe to the paid service YouTube Premium.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A small close icon in the top right corner is the third and
                    less focused option. Users have the option to click on the
                    x-icon to close the prompt and continue using YouTube.

                    Now, it appears, Google is making this option less
                    attractive to users on the site. Instead of displaying the
                    close icon directly, YouTube is now showing a timer in its
                    place. In other words: users who get the prompt have to wait
                    between 30 to 60 seconds before they can close the entire
                    prompt and start using the site.

                When NASA's Psyche probe launches in October on its mission to a
                metal asteroid as much as 309 million miles (497 million km)
                from Earth, it will be carrying a new laser communications
                system that promises to revolutionize deep space missions.<br />...<br />By
                relying on old-fashioned X-band radio systems, crewed and
                robotic missions suffer from bandwidths and transmission speeds
                that are ridiculously small and slow. A single high resolution
                image from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter can take an hour
                and a half to send and the data from the New Horizons
                spacecraft's flyby of Pluto took 16 days to download.
              </p>
              <p>
                In light of this, NASA has been experimenting with using lasers
                as a way to not only create much faster direct links between
                space missions and Earth, but also to free up the Deep Space
                Network (DSN) of antennas for more important tasks than routine
                communications.

                    When Intel joined the discrete GPU market almost a year ago,
                    everyone wondered when it would catch up with Nvidia and
                    AMD. As of August 2023, it apparently has, at least in one
                    respect; like its competitors, Intel has introduced a
                    telemetry collection service by default in the latest beta
                    driver for its Arc GPUs. You can opt out of it, but we all
                    know most people just click "yes" to everything during a
                    software installation. Intel's release notes for the drivers
                    don't mention this change to how its drivers work, which is
                    a curious omission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    News of Intel adding telemetry collection to its drivers is
                    a significant change to how its GPU drivers work. Intel has
                    even given this new collation routine a cute name—the Intel
                    Computing Improvement Program. Gee, that sounds pretty
                    wonderful. We want to improve our computing, so let's dive
                    into the details briefly.
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techpowerup.com/312122/psa-intel-graphics-drivers-now-collect-telemetry-by-default"
                      >According</a
                    >
                    to TechPowerUp, which discovered the change, Intel has
                    created a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/topics/idsa-cip.html"
                      >landing page</a
                    >
                    for the program that explains what is collected and what
                    isn't. At a high level, it states, "This program uses
                    information about your computer's performance to make
                    product improvements that may benefit you in the future."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Though this sounds like an egregious overreach
                    regarding the type of data captured, to be fair to Intel, it
                    allows you to opt out of this program. That is apparently
                    not the case with Nvidia, which doesn't even ask for
                    permission at any point during driver installation,
                    according to TechPowerUp. AMD, on the other hand,
                    <em>does</em> give you a choice to opt out like Intel does,
                    regardless of what other options you choose during
                    installation, and even provides an explainer about what it's
                    collecting.

                    Thousands of websites belonging to US government agencies,
                    leading universities, and professional organizations have
                    been hijacked over the last half decade and used to push
                    scammy offers and promotions, new research has found. Many
                    of these scams are aimed at children and attempt to trick
                    them into downloading apps, malware, or submitting personal
                    details in exchange for nonexistent rewards in

                    and <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/roblox/">Roblox</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For more than three years, security researcher Zach Edwards
                    has been tracking these website hijackings and scams. He
                    says the activity can be linked back to the activities of
                    affiliate users of one advertising company. The
                    US-registered company acts as a service that sends web
                    traffic to a range of online advertisers, allowing
                    individuals to sign up and use its systems. However, on any
                    given day, Edwards, a senior manager of threat insights at
                    <a href="https://www.humansecurity.com/">Human Security</a>,
                    uncovers scores of .gov, .org, and .edu domains being
                    compromised.

                    [...] The schemes and ways people make money are complex,
                    but each of the websites is hijacked in a similar way.
                    Vulnerabilities or weaknesses in a website's backend, or its
                    content management system, are exploited by attackers who
                    upload malicious PDF files to the website. These documents,
                    which Edwards calls “poison PDFs,” are designed to show up
                    in search engines and promote “free Fortnite skins,”
                    generators for Roblox’s in-game currency, or cheap streams
                    of Barbie, Oppenheimer, and other popular films.

                    The new law behind the ban, signed by Governor Kim Reynolds,
                    is part of a wave of educational reforms that Republican
                    lawmakers believe are necessary to protect students from
                    exposure to damaging and obscene materials. Specifically,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=90&amp;ba=SF496"
                      >Senate File 496</a
                    >
                    mandates that every book available to students in school
                    libraries be "age appropriate" and devoid of any
                    "descriptions or visual depictions of a sex act," per Iowa
                    Code 702.17.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But banning books is hard work, according to administrators,
                    so they need to rely on machine intelligence to get it done
                    within the three-month window mandated by the law. "It is
                    simply not feasible to read every book and filter for these
                    new requirements," said Bridgette Exman, the assistant
                    superintendent of the school district, in a statement quoted
                    by The Gazette. "Therefore, we are using what we believe is
                    a defensible process to identify books that should be
                    removed from collections at the start of the 23-24 school
                    year."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "There's something ironic about people in charge of
                    education not knowing enough to critically determine which
                    books are good or bad to include in curriculum, only to
                    outsource the decision to a system that can't understand
                    books and can't critically think at all," Dr. Margaret
                    Mitchell,

                    Desert ants have outstanding navigational skills. They live
                    in the saltpans of North Africa, an extremely inhospitable
                    environment. To find food for their nest mates, foraging
                    ants have to walk far into the desert. Once they have found
                    food, for example a dead insect, their actual problem
                    begins: How do they find their way back to their nest as
                    quickly as possible in the extremely hot and barren
                    environment? "The desert ant
                    <em>Cataglyphis fortis</em> stands out due its remarkable
                    ability to successfully navigate and forage in even the
                    harshest environments, making it an excellent subject for
                    studying the intricacies of navigation. With an innate
                    navigation mechanism called path integration, these ants use
                    both a sun compass and a step counter to measure the
                    distances they cover. In addition, they possess the ability
                    to learn and utilize visible and olfactory cues. We believe
                    that this extremely harsh habitat has led, during evolution,
                    to a navigation system of unsurpassed precision," said
                    Marilia Freire, the study's lead author, summarizing what is
                    known so far about the amazing orientation skills of these
                    small animals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The scientists had noticed during previous studies in
                    Tunisia that the nests in the center of the saltpans, where
                    there are hardly any visible landmarks, had high mounds at
                    the nest entrances. In contrast, nest hills near the
                    shrub-covered edges of the saltpans were lower or barely
                    noticeable. So the research team has wondered for some time
                    if these visible differences serve a purpose in helping the
                    ants better find their way home. "It's always hard to tell
                    whether an animal does something on purpose or not. The high
                    nest mounds in the middle of the saltpans could have been a
                    side effect of differences in soil structure or wind
                    conditions. However, crucial for our study was the idea to
                    remove the mounds and to provide some nests with artificial
                    landmarks and others not, and to observe what would happen,"
                    Markus Knaden, head of the Project Group Odor-guided
                    Behavior in the Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology,
                    explains the goal of the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Experiments in which ants could be tracked with
                    particular accuracy during the last meters to the nest,
                    thanks to a grid painted on the floor, showed that the nest
                    hills are important visual cues. If they were removed, fewer
                    ants found their way back to the nest, while their nest
                    mates simultaneously began to rebuild nest mounds as quickly
                    as possible. If, on the other hand, the scientists placed
                    artificial landmarks in the form of small black cylinders
                    near the nest entrances whose mounds they had previously
                    removed, the ants did not invest in building new ones.
                    Apparently, the cylinders were sufficient for orientation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In ant nests, labor is divided. Ants that go foraging are
                    usually older and more experienced nest members, while
                    younger ants are busy building. Therefore, there must be
                    some kind of information flow between the two groups. The
                    researchers do not yet know exactly how this is achieved.
                    "One possibility would be that ants in the nest somehow
                    notice that fewer foragers return home, and as a result,
                    hill-building activities at the nest entrance are
                    increased," says Marilia Freire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Markus Knaden has been studying desert ants for 25 years and
                    is still amazed by their fascinating abilities: "The animals
                    can learn visual and olfactory cues despite their small
                    brains. In addition, they are able to decide which
                    information is useful for their navigation and which is not.
                    All this was already known. However, the fact that they even
                    build their own landmarks for orientation and only choose to
                    invest in this work when other environmental cues are
                    missing is quite surprising."
