                    "It sounds unusual to have [a] cause type exclusion
                    provision in a tender offer agreement," attorney and stock
                    options expert Mary Russell told TechCrunch. She said it is
                    also unusual for a traditional venture-based startup to have
                    repurchase rights for vested shares that are unrelated to a
                    bad-actor-type "for cause" termination.

                    These terms "keep everyone under their control, even if they
                    have left the company," one former employee said, because
                    employees don't want to be forced to return their valuable
                    SpaceX stock for no compensation. "And since there is no
                    urgency by SpaceX to go public, being banned from tender
                    offers effectively zeros out your shares, at least for a
                    long time. Even though you paid thousands to cover the
                    taxes."

                  <p>
                    "They also try and force a non-disparagement agreement on
                    you when you leave, either with a carrot, or a stick if they
                    have one," the person said.

                    The new biography Steve Jobs contains a remarkable claim
                    about the power supply of the Apple II and its designer Rod
                    Holt:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        Instead of a conventional linear power supply, Holt
                        built one like those used in oscilloscopes. It switched
                        the power on and off not sixty times per second, but
                        thousands of times; this allowed it to store the power
                        for far less time, and thus throw off less heat. "That
                        switching power supply was as revolutionary as the Apple
                        II logic board was," Jobs later said. "Rod doesn't get a
                        lot of credit for this in the history books but he
                        should. Every computer now uses switching power
                        supplies, and they all rip off Rod Holt's design."

                  <p>
                    I found it amazing to think that computers now use power
                    supplies based on the Apple II's design, so I did some
                    investigation. It turns out that Apple's power supply was
                    not revolutionary, either in the concept of using a
                    switching power supply for computers or in the specific
                    design of the power supply. Modern computer power supplies
                    are totally different and do not rip off anything from Rod
                    Holt's design. It turns out that Steve Jobs was making his
                    customary claim that everyone is stealing Apple's
                    revolutionary technology, entirely contrary to the facts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The history of switching power supplies turns out to be
                    pretty interesting. While most people view the power supply
                    as a boring metal box, there's actually a lot of
                    technological development behind it. There was, in fact, a
                    revolution in power supplies in the late 1960s through the
                    mid 1970s as switching power supplies took over from simple
                    but inefficient linear power supplies, but this was a few
                    years before the Apple II came out in 1977. The credit for
                    this revolution should go to advances in semiconductor
                    technology, specifically improvements in switching
                    transistors, and then innovative ICs to control switching
                    power supplies.

                  There is little evidence that partial automation has any
                  safety benefits, so it's essential that these systems can only
                  be used when proven safety features are engaged. These include
                  seat belts, AEB and lane departure prevention. For a good
                  rating in this category, a partial automation system should
                  not switch on if the driver is unbelted or AEB or lane
                  departure prevention is not active. If already in operation
                  and the driver unfastens their seat belt, the system should
                  immediately begin its multi-mode, driver-disengagement
                  attention reminders. Finally, it must be impossible to switch
                  off AEB or lane departure prevention if the automation is
                  engaged.
                  <p>
                    The hands-free ProPILOT Assist 2.0, Lexus Teammate, and GM
                    Super Cruise systems are the only ones that meet all these
                    requirements. The hands-on ProPILOT Assist with Navi-link
                    and the BMW system come close, but each deactivates without
                    issuing an alert when a key safety feature is disengaged.
                    This is dangerous because the driver may not be aware that
                    they need to resume full control of the vehicle.

                  <p>
                    In contrast, most of the systems fail multiple safety
                    feature requirements. Volvo Pilot Assist, for example,
                    deactivates without an alert when the driver unbuckles, can
                    be activated with lane departure prevention turned off and
                    also remains active if the feature is switched off
                    mid-drive. The two Genesis systems fail all safety feature
                    requirements.

                    In 2019, astronomers discovered a group of white dwarfs that
                    mysteriously stopped cooling. These "forever-young" stars
                    remain at a near-constant surface temperature for at least
                    eight billion years—an incredible length of time,
                    considering the universe is 13.8 billion years old.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Something is fueling these stars from within, but given that
                    they had run out of their nuclear fuel source, scientists
                    were unsure what could be keeping them shining so brightly.
                    Our research, recently published in Nature, presents the
                    solution to this conundrum.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using information gathered by the Gaia space observatory of
                    the European Space Agency, researchers discovered that some
                    white dwarfs essentially stop cooling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By studying how white dwarfs are distributed as a function
                    of temperature (from hot to cold) in the Gaia data,
                    astronomers noticed an accumulation of white dwarfs at
                    intermediate temperatures. This indicates that some white
                    dwarfs spend more time at these intermediate
                    temperatures—eight billion years more than thought possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    White dwarfs are weird. A mere teaspoon of material from
                    their cores weighs several tons. Under such extreme
                    densities, matter can behave strangely. Even though the
                    interiors of white dwarfs are millions of degrees hot, the
                    density is high enough that they can freeze into a solid
                    state. They form crystals out of the carbon, oxygen and
                    other elements present in their interiors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The formation of these crystals normally starts at the
                    center of the star, where density is highest. As the white
                    dwarf cools down, more crystals are formed in successive
                    layers until almost the whole star is completely solid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, this inside-out crystallization does not apply to
                    all white dwarfs. We discovered that the heaviest elements
                    present in white dwarfs are expelled from the crystals as
                    they are formed, just as salt is expelled from ice crystals
                    when seawater freezes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The crystals become less dense than their surroundings, and
                    float up like ice cubes in a glass of water. As the crystals
                    do not stay in place, the core cannot simply freeze from the
                    inside out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The movements created by the floating crystals reshuffle the
                    chemical layering inside the star. Gradually, the heaviest
                    elements are transported toward the center. This releases a
                    steady flow of gravitational energy that keeps the star
                    shining at a near-constant temperature for billions of
                    years.

                    I had to create scans of a small flex PCB to capture more
                    details than a flat scanner could give me. Of course, this
                    task turned out harder than I imagined. I already had a good
                    camera, but I was lacking a good macro lens. Buying one
                    turned out to be hard because the highest magnification
                    ratios on most macro lenses are 1:1. The better ones are, of
                    course, pricier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After browsing some extreme macrophotography forums, I
                    discovered that some people use microscope objectives with
                    their cameras.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those microscope objectives are divided into two groups:
                    infinity-corrected and non-infinity-corrected. What does
                    this mean? The non-infinity-corrected objective focuses the
                    captured image on a plane some distance after the objective.
                    The infinity-corrected objective collimates the captured
                    light into a parallel beam. The second type is useful if you
                    need to Fourier transform the image by transparency masks or
                    do other fancy scientific image transformations. Filtering
                    light is easier if you work with a parallel beam. To use
                    this type of objective in macrophotography, you need an
                    additional lens to focus the parallel beam to an image on
                    the sensor plane.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first type of microscope objective can be used directly
                    with your interchangeable lens camera. The only thing you
                    need is an extension tube, which can be 3D printed in an
                    hour. I found a great Thingiverse repository that contains
                    extension tubes for microscopic objectives with various
                    camera mounts. Together with the cheapest 4X
                    non-infinity-corrected, achromatic microscope objective
                    gives decent results.

                Herb Sutter has an interesting article on his blog about
                approaches to improve security in C++ and modifying the language
                to assist with stopping programming errors that lead to
                exploits.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are two interesting insights. Firstly. most CVEs come from
                issues that could be dealt with with small changes to C++ that
                are being proposed.<br />The second is that even coding in
                languages with automatic memory allocation can still have
                massive vulnerabilties. Even code written in Rust has
                vulnerabilities so the language alone is not the whole problem.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>In that context, I'll focus on C++ and try to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      highlight what needs attention (what C++'s problem "is"),
                      and how we can get there by building on solutions already
                      underway;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      address some common misconceptions (what C++'s problem
                      "isn't"), including practical considerations of MSLs; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      leave a call to action for programmers using all
                      languages.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    tl;dr: I don't want C++ to limit what I can express
                    efficiently. I just want C++ to let me enforce our
                    already-well-known safety rules and best practices by
                    default, and make me opt out explicitly if that's what I
                    want. Then I can still use fully modern C++... just nicer.

                    The first flying taxi could take off in the UK by 2026 and
                    become a regular sight in our skies two years later, if a
                    government announcement goes to plan. The Future of Flight
                    action plan, developed with the aerospace industry, also
                    says drones and other flying vehicles will become more
                    autonomous. It predicts that the first pilotless flying taxi
                    will take off in 2030.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But experts say hurdles such as infrastructure and public
                    acceptance need to be overcome first.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are a number of different models, but most flying
                    taxis look like a futuristic helicopter and can usually
                    carry about five people. They are part of a family of
                    vehicles called "eVTOLs" - which stands for electric
                    vertical take-off and landing aircraft. The technology for
                    them exists now, but it is likely that the aircraft will
                    start off as exclusive modes of transport - replacing
                    expensive journeys currently done by helicopters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Department for Transport also plans to allow drones to
                    fly beyond visual line of sight - meaning the person
                    controlling the drone cannot see it in the air. Some of the
                    uses of unmanned drones include transporting medical
                    supplies, delivering post in rural areas and tracking down
                    criminals on the run. Their use is still in early stages,
                    but the plan suggests drone deliveries would be commonplace
                    by 2027.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The biggest obstacles to getting flying taxis into the air
                    are infrastructure and public perception, says Craig
                    Roberts, head of drones, at consultancy firm PwC.

                      >report on the topic</a

                    [...] No other mini airports have been built or trialled
                    since the demonstration two years ago. But according to the
                    government plan, the first vertiport (airport for vertical
                    vehicles) will be operational this year.

                    The UK's aerospace regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority,
                    is consulting on proposals for vertiports at existing
                    aerodromes. New regulation would almost certainly need to be
                    created if the government's aim of bringing in autonomous
                    air taxis by 2030 is to be met.

                    Vegetation plays a vital role in regulating the percentage
                    of precipitation reaching the ground to nourish the root
                    systems of plants both in the canopy and undergrowth, which
                    consequently supports the survival of the entire forest
                    ecosystem. Water arrives to the ground via multiple
                    mechanisms, including throughfall (water falling directly
                    through the canopy) or stemflow (water flowing down stems
                    and trunks), while some is intercepted by the canopy leaves
                    and does not reach ground level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    New research, published in Water Resources Research, has
                    focused on pour points, locations where water flowing under
                    the branches detach. These are distinguished from the large
                    drops falling from leaves, known as drip points.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A pour point is formed when the raindrops, initially
                    intercepted by leaves or the top half of the branch, flow to
                    the underside of branches, coalesce with other droplets to
                    form a rivulet, but fall before becoming a part of stemflow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The detachment of the rivulet can occur where multiple
                    branches converge or where a single branch changes in angle,
                    leading to a pour point. These are important as they
                    considerably increase water received from the canopy to the
                    forest floor at fixed points, thereby supporting enhanced
                    infiltration of water to the ground.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The volume of water received at pour points is impacted by a
                    number of factors, such as the structure of the branches,
                    leaf surface area (foliation), and the volume of rainfall.
                    The larger water droplets occurring at these points have
                    more kinetic energy than normal rainfall, meaning that they
                    create more pronounced dips in the soil upon impact, thus
                    augmenting infiltration efficiency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Measuring the water content of soil directly below
                    pour points, the research team found 20%–30% of the seasonal
                    rainfall volume infiltrated to a depth of 1 m here, compared
                    to just 5% in control test areas away from pour points. This
                    makes pour points important zones for groundwater recharge
                    and storage in the forest ecosystem, although in the study
                    site one pour point was identified per ~30 m2, matching the
                    distribution of banksia trees, being one pour point per tree
                    on average.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This particular study site in Western Australia is important
                    as it overlies a significant source of groundwater that
                    supplies the population of Perth. Therefore, the ability of
                    pour points to potentially recharge groundwater supplies at
                    this site (and at others via other trees globally), is vital
                    for supporting water resources management both for forests
                    and humanity.

              <p>Just a brief update - but welcome news for a change.</p>
              <p>
                After a long wait (and after a query to the IRS regarding the
                progress of our application), fliptop has received news verbally
                that we have been <b>approved</b> by the IRS for Not For Profit
                status. The essential paperwork should be with fliptop by the
                end of the week. Once it has been received we can then move
                ahead to create a company. Again, we cannot guess how long this
                process will take but it is the final step required before the
                community can take control of the site and its assets.
              </p>
              <p>My grateful thanks to fliptop for his efforts.</p>

                    Cisco announced plans to acquire software company Splunk in
                    September 2023 and announced the completion of the deal on
                    Monday in a press release.

                  <p>
                    The acquisition of Splunk now makes Cisco one of the largest
                    software companies in the world, Cisco said in the release.

                    To bolster weight-bearing capacity, many researchers have
                    attempted to thicken their paper-thin designs in varying
                    spots. U-M's team, however, found that uniformity is key.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What happens is you add one level of thickness here, and a
                    different level of thickness there, and it becomes
                    mismatched," Filipov said. "So when the load is carried
                    through these components, it starts to cause bending.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That uniformity of the component's thickness is what's key
                    and what's missing from many current origami systems. When
                    you have that, together with appropriate locking devices,
                    the weight placed upon a structure can be evenly transferred

                    In the attack, hackers create an app that injects malicious
                    code into the Meta Quest VR system and then launch a clone
                    of the VR system's home screen and apps that looks identical
                    to the user's original screen. Once inside, attackers can
                    see, record, and modify everything the person does with the
                    headset. That includes tracking voice, gestures, keystrokes,
                    browsing activity, and even the user's social interactions.
                    The attacker can even change the content of a user's
                    messages to other people. The

                    A spokesperson for Meta said the company plans to review the
                    findings: "We constantly work with academic researchers as
                    part of our bug bounty program and other initiatives."

                    VR headsets have slowly become more popular in recent years,
                    but security research has lagged behind product development,
                    and current defenses against attacks in VR are lacking.
                    What's more, the immersive nature of virtual reality makes
                    it harder for people to realize they've fallen into a trap.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The shock in this is how fragile the VR systems of today
                    are," says Heather Zheng, a professor of computer science at
                    the University of Chicago, who led the team behind the
                    research.

                  <p>
                    The inception attack exploits a loophole in Meta Quest
                    headsets: users must enable "developer mode" to download
                    third-party apps, adjust their headset resolution, or
                    screenshot content, but this mode allows attackers to gain
                    access to the VR headset if they're using the same Wi-Fi
                    network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Developer mode is supposed to give people remote access for
                    debugging purposes. However, that access can be repurposed
                    by a malicious actor to see what a user's home screen looks
                    like and which apps are installed. (Attackers can also
                    strike if they are able to access a headset physically or if
                    a user downloads apps that include malware.) With this
                    information, the attacker can replicate the victim's home
                    screen and applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then the attacker stealthily injects an app with the
                    inception attack in it. The attack is activated and the VR
                    headset hijacked when unsuspecting users exit an application
                    and return to the home screen. The attack also captures the
                    user's display and audio stream, which can be livestreamed
                    back to the attacker.

                    If you're a PC hardware geek who's been dreaming of a laptop
                    that you can upgrade far beyond the life cycle of a typical
                    machine, Framework's modular notebooks must seem like a
                    miracle. The American company has a straightforward pitch:
                    What if your laptop could be nearly as customizable as a
                    desktop, with the ability to swap components out for repairs
                    and upgrades? What if we could put an end to disposable
                    hardware? We were intrigued by Framework's original 13-inch
                    notebook and its Chromebook variant, despite some rough
                    edges and a basic design. Now, with the Framework Laptop 16,
                    the company is targeting the most demanding and (arguably)
                    hardest group of PC users to please: Gamers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Framework has already proved it can build compelling modular
                    laptops, but can the Laptop 16 cram in powerful graphics, a
                    fast display and other components to keep up with the likes
                    of Alienware, Razer and ASUS? Sort of, it turns out — and
                    there are plenty of other tradeoffs for living the modular
                    laptop dream. Hardware quirks abound, battery life is
                    mediocre and it still looks like a totally generic machine.
                    But how many other notebooks could let you completely
                    upgrade your CPU or GPU in a few years? Who else offers a
                    customizable keyboard setup? In those respects, the
                    Framework 16 stands alone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I was genuinely bummed to discover that it was a
                    fairly mediocre gaming machine, at least for its high price.

                What do you think? Is having a laptop that you can upgrade more
                important than having the fastest laptop on the block? What
                price would you pay for being able to upgrade your hardware?

                    Lyme disease is a fast-growing problem in the United States,
                    where approximately 476,000 people are diagnosed and treated
                    for it each year, according to the
                    <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/humancases.html"

                    from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That
                    number is likely an overestimate, because many patients are
                    treated after a tick bite even if an infection isn't
                    confirmed, but it underscores the burden of Lyme disease on

                    The No. 1 rule listed on the Suyu Discord is that "piracy is
                    prohibited." That includes any talk about downloading games
                    or "asking for system files, ROMs, encryption keys, shader
                    caches, and discussion of leaked games etc." Even a mention
                    of the word piracy with regard to legal questions is enough
                    to earn a warning on the Discord, according to those

                    SpaceX has been contracted by the Department of Defense's
                    National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to build a network of
                    hundreds of low-orbiting spy satellites capable of operating
                    as a swarm and tracking targets on the ground, according to
                    Reuters. The Reuters report, which cites five sources with
                    knowledge of the program, builds on earlier reporting by The
                    Wall Street Journal that revealed SpaceX had signed a $1.8
                    billion contract in 2021 with an unnamed agency.

                    This network, called Starshield, would reportedly be able to
                    gather continuous imagery all over Earth for US
                    intelligence, using a mix of large imaging satellites to
                    collect data and relay satellites to transmit information.
                    According to one source who spoke to Reuters, it has the
                    potential to make it so "no one can hide." Neither SpaceX
                    nor the NRO directly confirmed the company's involvement in
                    the project, but an NRO spokesperson told Reuters, "The
                    National Reconnaissance Office is developing the most
                    capable, diverse, and resilient space-based intelligence,
                    surveillance, and reconnaissance system the world has ever
                    seen."

                    The FCC has raised the speeds required to describe internet
                    service as "broadband" for the first time since 2015. The
                    agency's annual high-speed internet assessment concluded
                    that 100 Mbps downloads and 20 Mbps uploads will be the new
                    standard. The news will likely irk ISPs who would love to
                    keep pointing to 25 Mbps / 3 Mbps speeds (the previous
                    standards) and convincing people they're getting high-speed
                    broadband.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] More specifically, the agency said fixed terrestrial
                    broadband service (not including satellite) has yet to be
                    deployed to around 24 million Americans, including about 28
                    percent of people in rural areas and over 23 percent of
                    those living on Tribal lands. On the mobile front, it added
                    that about nine percent of Americans (including 36 percent
                    in rural areas and over 20 percent on Tribal lands) lack
                    adequate 5G cellular speeds of at least 35 Mbps down / 3
                    Mbps up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The FCC can't police ISPs to force them to boost their
                    speeds, but this type of move may be the best card it can
                    play. What it can do is prevent them from marketing their
                    services as "broadband" internet if they don't meet these
                    thresholds. It remains to be seen whether the companies
                    providing the infrastructure play ball or opt for other
                    marketing buzzwords to sell customers on glacial and
                    outdated internet speeds.

                    Many devices have been made difficult or financially
                    nonviable to repair, whether by design or because of a lack
                    of parts, manuals, or specialty tools. Machines that make
                    ice cream, however, seem to have a special place in the
                    hearts of lawmakers. Those machines are often broken and
                    locked down for only the most profitable repairs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Federal Trade Commission and the antitrust division of
                    the Department of Justice have asked the US Copyright Office
                    (PDF) to exempt "commercial soft serve machines" from the
                    anti-circumvention rules of Section 1201 of the Digital
                    Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The governing bodies also
                    submitted proprietary diagnostic kits, programmable logic
                    controllers, and enterprise IT devices for DMCA exemptions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In each case, an exemption would give users more choices
                    for third-party and self-repair and would likely lead to
                    cost savings and a better return on investment in commercial
                    and industrial equipment," the joint comment states. Those
                    markets would also see greater competition in the repair
                    market, and companies would be prevented from using DMCA
                    laws to enforce monopolies on repair, according to the
                    comment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Every three years, the Copyright Office allows for
                    petitions to exempt certain exceptions to DMCA violations
                    (and renew prior exemptions). Repair advocates have won
                    exemptions for farm equipment repair, video game consoles,
                    cars, and certain medical gear. The exemption is often
                    granted for device fixing if a repair person can work past
                    its locks, but not for the distribution of tools that would
                    make such a repair far easier. The esoteric nature of such
                    "release valve" offerings has led groups like the EFF to
                    push for the DMCA's abolishment.

                      Researchers have found a new way to simplify the structure
                      of high-efficiency blue organic light-emitting diodes
                      (OLEDs), which could lead to longer-lasting and higher
                      definition television screens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      OLEDs are a class of organic electronics that are already
                      found commercially in smartphones and displays and can be
                      more efficient than competing technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Although OLED television screens have vivid picture
                      quality, they also have drawbacks such as high cost and
                      comparatively short lifespans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      [...] An OLED is built like a sandwich, with organic
                      semiconductor layers between two electrodes. In the middle
                      of the stack is the emissive layer, which lights up when
                      powered with electricity. Electrical energy goes into the
                      molecules, which then release this extra energy as light.

                    Uber and Lyft say they're ending services in Minneapolis
                    over a city-mandated driver pay increase. The city council
                    pushed through the measure to bring driver pay closer to the
                    local minimum wage of $15.57 an hour.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, Uber and Lyft say they'll end services in the
                    city before the pay rise takes effect on May 1. Lyft says
                    the increase is "deeply flawed," citing a Minnesota study
                    indicating that drivers could meet the minimum wage and
                    still cover health insurance, paid leave and retirement
                    savings at lower rates of $1.21 per mile and 49 cents per
                    minute. "We support a minimum earning standard for drivers,
                    but it should be done in an honest way that keeps the
                    service affordable for riders," spokesperson CJ Macklin told
                    The Verge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An Uber spokesperson told the publication that the company
                    was disappointed by the council's choice to "ignore the data
                    and kick Uber out of the Twin Cities," putting around 10,000
                    drivers out of work. They noted Uber's confidence that by
                    working with drivers, drivers and legislators, "we can
                    achieve comprehensive statewide legislation that guarantees
                    drivers a fair minimum wage, protects their independence and
                    keeps rideshare affordable."

                    The Ubuntu-based distro currently includes
                    <em>Hexchat</em> in its default software set.
                    <em>IRC</em> isn't as trendy as <em>Discord</em> or
                    <em>Telegram</em> but it is a free, open standard that no
                    single entity controls, is relatively low-bandwidth,
                    interoperable, and efficient.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But as I reported in February:
                    <a
                      href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2024/02/hexchat-irc-client-final-release"
                      ><em>Hexchat</em> is no more.</a
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Hexchat</em> quitting the chat leaves —I so badly want
                    to type <em>leafs</em> there— Linux Mint with a dilemma and
                    an opportunity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The <em>dilemma</em> being: "should we continue shipping an
                    IRC client, and what role does it serve?" and the
                    <em>opportunity</em> being: "could we replace it with
                    something better?".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ever wondered <em>why</em> Linux Mint comes with an
                    IRC client preinstalled? It's mainly to offer a way for
                    users of the distro to talk to, ask questions, and get
                    support from other users of the distro in (relative) real
                    time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since its official IRC channels remain active, with
                    users and developers using them daily to answer questions,
                    offer support, and connect over a shared interest, should
                    the demise of <em>Hexchat</em> have to mean moating of IRC
                    entirely?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As is, IRC isn't user-friendly. It's a kind of an arcane
                    magic involving strange commands. Its onboarding is obtuse.
                    And the protocol doesn't natively support things like media
                    sharing (screenshots are useful when troubleshooting),
                    clickable links, or other modern "niceties".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And yet, IRC is a fast, established, open, and versatile
                    protocol. It's not as flashy as <em>Discord</em> but it's
                    not encumbered by superfluous social excesses or corporate
                    caveats. It's free and immediate (no sign-up required to use
                    it) which makes it ideal for 'when you need it' use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So work has begun on a new dedicated "chat room" app to
                    replace <em>Hexchat</em>, called <em>Jargonaut</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Linux Mint's goal is not to build a fully-featured IRC
                    client, or even an IRC client at all. Jargonaut is a chat
                    app that just happens to use IRC as its underlying chat
                    protocol.

                    Is there a way to stick hard and soft materials together
                    without any tape, glue or epoxy? A new study

                    in <em>ACS Central Science</em> shows that applying a small
                    voltage to certain objects forms chemical bonds that
                    securely link the objects together. Reversing the direction
                    of electron flow easily separates the two materials. This
                    electroadhesion effect could help create biohybrid robots,
                    improve biomedical implants and enable new battery
                    technologies.

                    When an adhesive is used to attach two things, it binds the
                    surfaces either through mechanical or electrostatic forces.
                    But sometimes those attractions or bonds are difficult, if
                    not impossible, to undo. As an alternative, reversible
                    adhesion methods are being explored, including
                    electroadhesion (EA).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Though the term is used to describe a few different
                    phenomena, one definition involves running an electric
                    current through two materials causing them to stick
                    together, thanks to attractions or chemical bonds.
                    Previously, Srinivasa Raghavan and colleagues
                    <a
                      href="https://phys.org/news/2023-05-gluing-soft-materials.html"
                      >demonstrated that EA can hold soft, oppositely charged
                      materials together</a
                    >, and even be used to build simple structures. This time,
                    they wanted to see if EA could reversibly bind a hard
                    material, such as graphite, to a soft material, such as
                    animal tissue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For EA to occur, the authors found that the hard
                    material needs to conduct electrons, and the soft material
                    needs to contain salt ions They hypothesize that the
                    adhesion arises from chemical bonds that form between the
                    surfaces after an exchange of electrons. This may explain
                    why some metals that hold onto their electrons strongly,
                    including titanium, and some fruits that contain more sugar
                    than salts, including grapes, failed to adhere in some
                    situations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A final experiment showed that EA can occur completely
                    underwater, revealing an even wider range of possible
                    applications. The team says that this work could help create
                    new batteries, enable biohybrid robotics, enhance biomedical
                    implants and much more.

                    A 20-year-old Trojan resurfaced recently with new variants
                    that target Linux and impersonate a trusted hosted domain to
                    evade detection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers from Palo Alto Networks spotted a new Linux
                    variant of the

                    to mimic a legitimate VMware domain, which allows the
                    malware to fly under the radar.

                    is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that's been active since
                    2004 and gathers sensitive information, such as hostname and
                    IP address, from a compromised system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There has been a worrying spike in Bifrost Linux variants
                    during the past few months: Palo Alto Networks has detected
                    more than 100 instances of Bifrost samples, which "raises
                    concerns among security experts and organizations,"
                    researchers Anmol Murya and Siddharth Sharma wrote in the
                    company's newly published findings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, there is evidence that cyberattackers aim to
                    expand Bifrost's attack surface even further, using a
                    malicious IP address associated with a Linux variant hosting
                    an ARM version of Bifrost as well, they said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "By providing an ARM version of the malware, attackers can
                    expand their grasp, compromising devices that may not be
                    compatible with x86-based malware," the researchers
                    explained. "As ARM-based devices become more common,
                    cybercriminals will likely change their tactics to include
                    ARM-based malware, making their attacks stronger and able to
                    reach more targets."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Though it may be an old-timer when it comes to
                    malware, the Bifrost RAT remains a significant and evolving
                    threat to individuals and organizations alike, particularly
                    with new variants adopting

                    >
                    to evade detection, the researchers said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In their post, the researchers shared a list of
                    indicators of compromise, including malware samples and
                    domain and IP addresses associated with the latest Bifrost
                    Linux variants. The researchers advise that enterprises use
                    next-generation firewall products and
                    <a
                      href="https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/microsoft-expands-cloud-security-posture-management-to-google-cloud"

                    — including URL filtering, malware-prevention applications,
                    and visibility and analytics — to secure cloud environments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, the process of infection allows the malware to
                    bypass security measures and evade detection, and ultimately
                    compromise targeted systems, the researchers said.

                    Journalists need never ask corporations for permission to
                    investigate or embarrass them, and the law shouldn't
                    encourage or force them to. Just because someone doesn't
                    like what a reporter does online doesn't mean that it's
                    without authorization and that what he did is therefore a

                    discrimination could expose them to CFAA liability for
                    exceeding sites' terms of service.<br />[...]<br />If
                    journalists must seek permission to publish information they
                    find online from the very people they're exposing, as the
                    government's indictment of Burke suggests, it's a good bet
                    that most information from the obscure but public corners of
                    the Internet will never see the light of day. That would
                    endanger both journalism and public access to important
                    truths. The court reviewing Burke's case should dismiss the
                    charges.

                    "Our goal was to make proinsulin, purify it out to insulin,
                    and go from there," said Wheeler. "But the cow basically
                    processed it herself. She makes [a ratio of] about
                    three-to-one biologically active insulin to proinsulin. The
                    mammary gland is a magical thing."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The insulin and proinsulin were expressed at a few grams per
                    liter of milk. Because lactation was induced by hormones and
                    the milk volume was smaller than expected, the researchers
                    are unable to say exactly how much insulin a cow would make
                    during a typical lactation. But they're willing to hazard a
                    (conservative) guess; if proven correct, the numbers are
                    astounding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Wheeler said that if a cow produced one gram of
                    insulin per liter of milk and a typical Holstein cow – which
                    produces more milk than any other breed of dairy cow – made
                    40 to 50 liters a day, that adds up to a lot of insulin.
                    This is especially true considering that one international
                    unit (IU) of insulin is the biological equivalent of 0.0347
                    mg of pure crystalline insulin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That means each gram is equivalent to 28,818 units of
                    insulin," Wheeler said. "And that's just one liter;
                    Holsteins can produce 50 liters a day. You can do the math."

                    AI assistants have been widely available for a little more
                    than a year, and they already have access to our most
                    private thoughts and business secrets. People ask them about
                    becoming pregnant or terminating or preventing pregnancy,
                    consult them when considering a divorce, seek information
                    about drug addiction, or ask for edits in emails containing
                    proprietary trade secrets. The providers of these AI-powered
                    chat services are keenly aware of the sensitivity of these
                    discussions and take active steps—mainly in the form of
                    encrypting them—to prevent potential snoops from reading
                    other people's interactions.

                    But now, researchers have devised an attack that deciphers
                    AI assistant responses with surprising accuracy. The
                    technique exploits a

                    Engineers are hopeful that the veteran spacecraft Voyager 1
                    might have turned a corner after spending the last three
                    months spouting gibberish at controllers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On March 1, the Voyager team sent a command, dubbed a
                    "poke," to get the probe's Flight Data System (FDS) to try
                    some other sequences in its software in the hope of
                    circumventing whatever had become corrupted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Readers of a certain vintage will doubtless have memories of
                    poke sheets for various 1980s games. Not that this hack ever
                    used a poke to get infinite lives in Jet Set Willy, of
                    course.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Voyager 1's lifespan is not infinite, it has endured
                    far longer than anticipated and might be about to dodge yet
                    another bullet. On March 3, the mission team saw something
                    different in the stream of data returned from the
                    spacecraft, which had been unreadable since December.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An engineer with the Deep Space Network (DSN) was able to
                    decode it, and by March 10, the team determined that it
                    contained a complete memory dump from the FDS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The next step is to study the memory read-out and
                    compare it to one transmitted before the problem arose. A
                    solution to the issue could then be devised.
                  </p>

                    One of the original Voyager scientists, Garry Hunt, told The
                    Register that engineers at JPL were determined to get
                    communications with the stricken probe working again: "This
                    requires both skills and patience with the long time between
                    communication instructions and response."

                    [...] When Eve broke down the results by publisher, less
                    than 1 percent of the 204 publishers had put the majority of
                    their content into multiple archives. (The cutoff was 75
                    percent of their content in three or more archives.) Fewer
                    than 10 percent had put more than half their content in at
                    least two archives. And a full third seemed to be doing no
                    organized archiving at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The good news is that large academic publishers appear
                    to be reasonably good about getting things into archives;
                    most of the unarchived issues stem from smaller publishers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] None of this is to say that we've already lost
                    important research documents. But Eve's paper serves a
                    valuable function by highlighting that the risk is real.
                    We're well into the era where print copies of journals are
                    irrelevant to most academics, and digital-only academic
                    journals have proliferated. It's long past time for us to
                    have clear standards in place to ensure that digital
                    versions of research have the endurance that print works
                    have enjoyed.

                    Monitors. XY was Atari's name for what the Computer Graphics
                    industry calls '"Random Scan" and the Video Game Community
                    calls "Vector Games." The major parts of the XY Monitor are
                    the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), the Deflection Amplifiers, and
                    the High Voltage Supply.

                    Boeing whistleblower John Barnett, 62, was found dead in his
                    truck in a hotel parking lot in South Carolina over the
                    weekend.

                    Mr Barnett blew the whistle on alleged safety problems at
                    the aircraft manufacturing giant and had been giving
                    evidence in a lawsuit against the company in recent days.

                  <p>
                    [...] Mr Barnett's former employer, Boeing, has responded to
                    his death, saying: "We are saddened by Mr Barnett's passing,
                    and our thoughts are with his family and friends."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In 2019, Mr Barnett alleged that Boeing intentionally
                    used defective parts in its planes and warned that
                    passengers on its 787 Dreamliner might face a lack of oxygen
                    if a sudden decompression occurred.

                    John Barnett, 62, was a quality manager who retired in 2017
                    after several decades with the company. He died March 9 of
                    what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Barnett's whistleblower complaint has been pending for
                    more than seven years, according to a 2022 order denying
                    Boeing's motion to dismiss the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Barnett originally filed a complaint with the
                    Occupational Safety and Health Administration in January
                    2017 alleging that Boeing retaliated against him. After
                    nearly four years, the agency concluded that there was no
                    retaliation, a decision that Barnett appealed about three
                    years ago. His case has been pending since then, as the two
                    sides have gone through discovery and prehearing motions.

                    The NYPD sent a sweeping subpoena seeking information from
                    the social media account of the president of a New York City
                    police accountability organization in February, records
                    reviewed by Hell Gate show, only to withdraw its subpoena
                    when told they would need to justify the subpoena in court.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Michael Clancy, better known to friends on and off social
                    media as Rabbi, received a notice last month from X,
                    formerly known as Twitter, alerting him to the fact that the
                    NYPD had sent X a subpoena requesting "all records
                    consisting but not limited to all subscriber name(s), Email
                    address(s), Phone number(s), account creation date, IP logs
                    with timestamps (IP address of account logins and logouts),
                    all logs of previous messages sent and received." The
                    subpoena also requested "all videos sent and received,
                    including but not limited to meta-data. exit data about the
                    messages and videos" for the account.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The notification included a copy of the subpoena, which
                    warned X not to tell Clancy of its existence. "You are not
                    to disclose or notify any customer or third party of the
                    existence of this subpoena or that records were provided
                    pursuant to this subpoena," the document read.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But X, following its own corporate policy, told Clancy
                    anyway, and suggested he might want to get some legal
                    representation to fight the subpoena, recommending the
                    American Civil Liberties Union.

                    Banana Pi is now selling a fully built Wi-Fi 6 router with
                    some solid features for just $30 excluding shipping via Ali
                    Express. This router uses OpenWRT firmware and dual-core Arm
                    A9 Processor-based Triductor TR6560 SoC with Triductor's
                    TR5220 WiFi 6 chipset.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company has been selling this WiFi 6 router board on its
                    own, but now you can buy an out-of-box unit that contains an
                    enclosure for the board with six external antennas, Ethernet
                    cables, and a power adapter with either EU or US plugs. The
                    only difference here is that one of the LAN ports is
                    removed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The router supports the 802.11ax bandwidth protocol
                    and provides WPA3 password protection. Power over Ethernet
                    is optional and can be added via a module, but it needs to
                    be soldered.

                    A new industrial-scale 'sand battery' has been announced for
                    Finland, which packs 1 MW of power and a capacity of up to
                    100 MWh of thermal energy for use during those cold polar
                    winters. The new battery will be about 10 times bigger than
                    a pilot plant that's been running since 2022.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The sand battery, developed by Polar Night Energy, is a
                    clever concept. Basically, it's a big steel silo of sand (or
                    a similar solid material) that's warmed up through a heat
                    exchanger buried in the center, using excess electricity
                    from the grid – say, that generated during a spike from
                    renewable sources, when it's cheap.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That energy can then be stored for months at a time, with
                    reportedly very little loss, before being extracted as heat
                    on demand. This could theoretically be converted back into
                    electricity, although with some energy loss. But Polar Night
                    says that the most efficient method is to just use the heat
                    itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a chilly place like Finland, that means feeding it into
                    the local district heating system, which shares heat
                    produced from industry or energy production through the
                    community. Networks of pipes carry this heat as hot water or
                    steam to warm up houses, buildings, even swimming pools. In
                    this case, the new sand battery would be trialed in the
                    district heating system of the Finnish municipality of
                    Pornainen, run by a company called Loviisan Lämpö.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This new sand battery is expected to stand 13 m (42.7 ft)
                    tall and 15 m (49.2 ft) wide, providing an output power of 1
                    MW and a capacity of 100 MWh. That, the companies claim,
                    equates to a week's worth of Pornainen's heat demands in
                    winter, or a month's worth in summer. By comparison, Polar
                    Night's previous sand battery stands 4 x 7 m (13 x 23 ft),
                    for a nominal power rating of 100 kW and a capacity of 8
                    MWh.

                    Since Broadcom's $61 billion acquisition of VMware closed in
                    November 2023, Broadcom has been charging ahead with major
                    changes to the company's personnel and products. In
                    December, Broadcom began laying off thousands of employees
                    and stopped selling perpetually licensed versions of VMware
                    products, pushing its customers toward more stable and
                    lucrative software subscriptions instead. In January, it
                    ended its partner programs, potentially disrupting sales and
                    service for many users of its products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This week, Broadcom is making a change that is smaller in
                    scale but possibly more relevant for home users of its
                    products: The free version of VMware's vSphere Hypervisor,
                    also known as ESXi,
                    <a href="https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2107518"
                      >is being discontinued</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ESXi is what is known as a "bare-metal hypervisor,"
                    lightweight software that runs directly on hardware without
                    requiring a separate operating system layer in between. ESXi
                    allows you to split a PC's physical resources (CPUs and CPU
                    cores, RAM, storage, networking components, and so on) among
                    multiple virtual machines. ESXi also supports passthrough
                    for PCI, SATA, and USB accessories, allowing guest operating
                    systems direct access to components like graphics cards and
                    hard drives.

                    Reddit, one of the most popular websites in the world, is
                    hoping for a valuation of up to $6.4bn (£5bn) when its
                    shares go public next week.

                    Microsoft is ending support for its Android subsystem in
                    Windows 11 next year. The software giant first announced it
                    was bringing Android apps to Windows 11 with Amazon's
                    Appstore nearly three years ago, but this Windows Subsystem
                    for Android will now be deprecated starting March 5th, 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Microsoft is ending support for the Windows Subsystem for
                    Android" (WSA), reads a new support document from Microsoft.
                    "As a result, the Amazon Appstore on Windows and all
                    applications and games dependent on WSA will no longer be
                    supported beginning March 5, 2025."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you currently use Android apps from the Amazon Appstore,
                    then you'll continue to have access to these past the
                    support cutoff date, but you won't be able to download any
                    new ones once Microsoft makes its Android subsystem end of
                    life next year. [Since] March 6th [2024], Windows 11 users
                    will no longer be able to search for Amazon Appstore or
                    associated Android apps from the Microsoft Store.

                    In the summer months, the researchers found that healthy
                    colonies paid little attention to the pulse as the bees were
                    too busy foraging for food, caring for their young and
                    maintaining the hive. Other than freezing momentarily when
                    they heard it, the bees' response signal was almost absent
                    as they went about their business. The response signal was
                    stronger as winter arrived and then disappeared again with
                    the warmer spring weather. To the researchers, the winter
                    response indicated that the colony was clustered together
                    for warmth and was healthy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the nine colonies the researchers examined developed
                    serious health deterioration and was the only one to
                    consistently exhibit a strong, easily measurable, long-lived
                    buzzing response throughout the summer while the colony was
                    slowly declining. Although they couldn't generalize, the
                    researchers hope this signal might indicate "at least some
                    health disorders, at least in the active season."

                    The third flight test of Starship is targeted to launch
                    Thursday, March 14. The 110-minute test window opens at 7:00
                    a.m. CT (8:00 a.m. ET).

                    A live webcast of the flight test will begin about 30
                    minutes before liftoff, which you can watch here and on X
                    @SpaceX. As is the case with all developmental testing, the
                    schedule is dynamic and likely to change, so be sure to stay
                    tuned to our X account for updates.

                    Starship's second flight test achieved a number of major
                    milestones and provided invaluable data to continue rapidly
                    developing Starship. Each of these flight tests continue to
                    be just that: a test. They aren't occurring in a lab or on a
                    test stand, but are putting flight hardware in a flight
                    environment to maximize learning.

                  <p>
                    The third flight test aims to build on what we've learned
                    from previous flights while attempting a number of ambitious
                    objectives, including the successful ascent burn of both

                    will also fly a new trajectory, with Starship targeted to
                    splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This new flight path enables
                    us to attempt new techniques like in-space engine burns

                Google's swanky new "Bay View" campus apparently has a major
                problem: bad Wi-Fi.
                <a

                  >Reuters reports</a
                >
                that Google's first self-designed office building has "been
                plagued for months by inoperable or, at best, spotty Wi-Fi,
                according to six people familiar with the matter." A Google
                spokesperson
                <a
                  href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/googles-self-designed-office-swallows-wi-fi-like-the-bermuda-triangle/"
                  >confirmed the problems</a
                >
                and said the company is working on fixing them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bay View opened in May 2022. At launch, Google's VP of Real
                Estate &amp; Workplace Services, David Radcliffe, said the site
                "marks the first time we developed one of our own major
                campuses, and the process gave us the chance to rethink the very
                idea of an office." The result is a wild tent-like structure
                with a striking roofline made up of swooping square sections. Of
                course, it's all made of metal and glass, but the roof shape
                looks like squares of cloth held up by poles—each square section
                has high points on the four corners and sags down in the middle.
                The roof is covered in solar cells and collects rainwater while
                also letting in natural light, and Google calls it the "Gradient
                Canopy."

                    According to one AI engineer assigned to the building, which
                    also houses members of the advertising team, the wonky Wi-Fi
                    has been no help for Google pushing a three day per week
                    return-to-office mandate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "You'd think the world's leading internet company would have
                    worked this out," he said. Like others, he spoke to Reuters
                    on the condition of anonymity because Google has not
                    authorized them to talk about work conditions.

                    the adjoining cafe where the Wi-Fi signal is stronger.

                    generate" supposedly "highly anomalous results" showing that
                    ChatGPT would produce excerpts of NYT articles. [...] But
                    while defending tactics used to prompt ChatGPT to spout
                    memorized training data—including more than 100 NYT
                    articles—NYT pointed to ChatGPT users who have frequently
                    used the tool to generate entire articles to bypass
                    paywalls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the filing, NYT today has no idea how many of
                    its articles were used to train GPT-3 and OpenAI's
                    subsequent AI models, or which specific articles were used,
                    because OpenAI has "not publicly disclosed the makeup of the
                    datasets used to train" its AI models. Rather than setting
                    up a lawsuit, NYT was prompting ChatGPT to discover evidence
                    in attempts to track the full extent of copyright
                    infringement of the tool, NYT argued. [...] "In OpenAI's
                    telling, The Times engaged in wrongdoing by detecting
                    OpenAI's theft of The Times's own copyrighted content,"
                    NYT's court filing said. "OpenAI's true grievance is not
                    about how The Times conducted its investigation, but instead
                    what that investigation exposed: that Defendants built their
                    products by copying The Times's content on an unprecedented
                    scale—a fact that OpenAI does not, and cannot, dispute." On

                      href="https://community.openai.com/t/why-did-my-web-browsing-option-disappear-topic-curation/286748/7"
                      >community page</a
                    >, one paid ChatGPT user complained that OpenAI is "working
                    against the paid users of ChatGPT Plus. This time they're
                    taking away Browsing, because it reads the content of a site
                    that the user asks for? Please, that's what I pay for Plus
                    for."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I know it's no use complaining, because OpenAI is going to
                    increasingly 'castrate' ChatGPT 4," the ChatGPT user
                    continued, "but there's my rant."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NYT argued that public reports of users turning to ChatGPT
                    to bypass paywalls "contradict OpenAI's contention that its
                    products have not been used to serve up paywall-protected
                    content, underscoring the need for discovery" in the
                    lawsuit, rather than dismissal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NYT wants a court to not only award damages for profits lost
                    due to ChatGPT's alleged infringement, but also to order a
                    permanent injunction to stop ChatGPT from infringement. A
                    win for NYT could mean that

                    Even when the two sentences had the same meaning, the models
                    were more likely to apply adjectives like "dirty," "lazy,"
                    and "stupid" to speakers of African American English (AAE)
                    than speakers of Standard American English (SAE). The models
                    associated speakers of AAE with less prestigious jobs (or
                    didn't associate them with having a job at all), and when
                    asked to pass judgment on a hypothetical criminal defendant,
                    they were more likely to recommend the death penalty.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An even more notable finding may be a flaw the study
                    pinpoints in the ways that researchers try to solve such
                    biases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To purge models of hateful views, companies like OpenAI,
                    Meta, and Google use feedback training, in which human
                    workers manually adjust the way the model responds to
                    certain prompts. This process, often called "alignment,"
                    aims to recalibrate the millions of connections in the
                    neural network and get the model to conform better with
                    desired values.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The method works well to combat overt stereotypes, and
                    leading companies have employed it for nearly a decade. If
                    users prompted GPT-2, for example, to name stereotypes about
                    Black people, it was likely to list "suspicious," "radical,"
                    and "aggressive," but GPT-4 no longer responds with those
                    associations, according to the paper.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However the method fails on the covert stereotypes that
                    researchers elicited when using African-American English in
                    their study, which was published on
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00742.pdf">arXiv</a> and
                    has not been peer reviewed. That's partially because
                    companies have been less aware of dialect prejudice as an
                    issue, they say. It's also easier to coach a model not to
                    respond to overtly racist questions than it is to coach it
                    not to respond negatively to an entire dialect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Feedback training teaches models to consider their racism,"
                    says Valentin Hofmann, a researcher at the Allen Institute
                    for AI and a coauthor on the paper. "But dialect prejudice
                    opens a deeper level."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Avijit Ghosh, an ethics researcher at Hugging Face who was
                    not involved in the research, says the finding calls into
                    question the approach companies are taking to solve bias.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This alignment—where the model refuses to spew racist
                    outputs—is nothing but a flimsy filter that can be easily
                    broken," he says.

                    been trying to resolve the issue, but given how far the
                    spacecraft currently is, the process has been extremely
                    slow. Things are looking pretty bleak for the aging mission,
                    which might be nearing the end. Still, NASA isn’t ready to
                    let go of its most distant spacecraft just yet.

                    “The team continues information gathering and are preparing
                    some steps that they’re hopeful will get them on a path to
                    either understand the root of the problem and/or solve it,”
                    a JPL spokesperson told Gizmodo in an email.

                  <p>
                    The anomaly may have something to do with the spacecraft’s
                    flight data system (FDS). FDS collects data from Voyager’s
                    science instruments, as well as engineering data about the
                    health of the spacecraft and combines them into a single
                    package that’s transmitted to Earth through one of the
                    probe’s subsystems, the telemetry modulation unit (TMU), in
                    binary code.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    FDS and TMU, however, may be having trouble communicating
                    with one another. As a result, TMU has been sending data to
                    mission control in a repeating pattern of ones and zeroes.

                    last November. The current board expressed its confidence in
                    the leadership of Altman and President Greg Brockman, and
                    Altman is rejoining the board.<br />[...]<br />The
                    independent review, conducted by law firm
                    <a href="https://www.wilmerhale.com/en">WilmerHale</a>,
                    investigated the circumstances that led to Altman's abrupt
                    removal from the board and his termination as CEO on
                    November 17, 2023. Despite
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/12/the-real-research-behind-the-wild-rumors-about-openais-q-project/"
                      >rumors to the contrary</a
                    >, the board did not fire Altman because they got a peek at
                    scary new AI technology and flinched. "WilmerHale... found
                    that the prior Board's decision did not arise out of
                    concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of
                    development, OpenAI's finances, or its statements to
                    investors, customers, or business partners."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead, the review determined that the prior board's
                    actions stemmed from a breakdown in trust between the board
                    and Altman.<br />[...]<br />Altman's surprise firing
                    occurred after he attempted to remove Helen Toner from
                    OpenAI's board due to disagreements over her criticism of
                    OpenAI's approach to AI safety and hype. Some board members

                  <p>
                    In a statement posted on X, Altman

                    i'll say now: when i believed a former board member was
                    harming openai through some of their actions, i should have

                    paramount when building a technology as potentially
                    world-changing as AGI," they wrote. "We hope the new board
                    does its job in governing OpenAI and holding it accountable
                    to the mission. As we told the investigators, deception,
                    manipulation, and resistance to thorough oversight should be
                    unacceptable."
