                    Huawei's focus on EDA software for 14nm and larger chips
                    reflects the current state of China's semiconductor
                    industry. State-backed foundry operator SMIC currently
                    possesses the ability to produce 14nm chips at scale,
                    although there have been some reports the company has had
                    success developing a 7nm process node.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To put that in perspective, TSMC and Samsung are currently

                    production of 3nm process tech, while Intel has said it will
                    have a 2nm chip in production by late next year. This puts
                    China's semiconductor industry two to three generations
                    behind that of Taiwan, South Korea, and the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, 14nm isn't cutting edge, though it's also not useless.

                    <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/ns-23-findings/"

                    that a "thermo-structural failure" in the NS-23 rocket's
                    engine nozzle was to blame. Operational temperatures for the
                    nozzle climbed higher than expected following cooling system
                    design changes, creating fatigue that misaligned the thrust
                    and activated the crew capsule's escape system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Engineers are already taking "corrective actions" that
                    include redesigning the combustion chamber and operating
                    conditions. Blue Origin has also tweaked the nozzle design
                    to improve its structural integrity. The capsule wasn't
                    damaged and will fly again, Blue Origin says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company says it hopes to resume flights "soon," but
                    hasn't provided an exact date. It intends to restart
                    operations by re-flying the research payload from the
                    aborted mission. The Federal Aviation Administration has to
                    accept the incident findings before Blue Origin can move
                    forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There's plenty of pressure on Blue Origin to address the
                    issues. The company recently obtained a NASA contract to

                    pushing for a

                    trustworthy, the sooner it can secure customers that include
                    governments and space tourists.

                    Devices used in critical infrastructure are riddled with
                    vulnerabilities that can cause denial of service, allow
                    configuration manipulation, and achieve remote code
                    execution, according to security researchers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers looked at 45 operational technology (OT)
                    product lines used in government, healthcare, water, oil and
                    gas, power generation, manufacturing, retail and other
                    sectors from ten different major vendors. By reverse
                    engineering the products, they were able to identify bad
                    practices like unauthenticated protocols and weak
                    cryptography.
                  </p>

                    From 53 identified CVEs: More than a third (21 CVEs) could
                    facilitate credential compromise. Another 18 CVEs involved
                    data manipulation, with 13 of these allowing firmware
                    manipulation. And 10 CVEs provided a path to remote code
                    execution.

                  <p>
                    Based on open source inquiries (e.g., using the Shodan
                    search engine), the authors determined that a significant
                    number of potentially vulnerable systems are exposed to the
                    internet.

                    Yokogawa, and Schneider Electric.

                    "Worryingly, many of these products are certified but suffer
                    from vulnerabilities that should have been caught in the
                    certification process," the researchers say in their paper,
                    citing IEC 62443 labelled products that weren't compliant.
                    "...This suggests that apart from what the standards may not
                    cover, even the things they do cover are not always properly

                    drives in the mail from Quinsaloma. Each of the USB sticks
                    was meant to explode when activated.<br />[...]<br />According
                    to a police official who spoke with AFP, the journalist
                    suffered mild hand and face injuries, and no one else was

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to police official Xavier Chango, the flash drive
                    that went off had a 5-volt explosive charge and is thought
                    to have used RDX. Also known as T4, according to the
                    Environmental Protection Agency (<a

                      >PDF</a
                    >), militaries, including the US's, use RDX, which "can be
                    used alone as a base charge for detonators or mixed with
                    other explosives, such as TNT." Chango said it comes in
                    capsules measuring about 1 cm, but only half of it was
                    activated in the drive that Artieda plugged in, which likely
                    saved him some harm.

                    Many people say that they listen to music to help them fall
                    asleep, raising the question of whether music chosen for
                    this purpose shares certain universal characteristics.
                    However, research on the characteristics of sleep music is
                    limited, and prior studies have tended to be relatively
                    small.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To better understand the characteristics of sleep music,
                    Scarratt and colleagues analyzed 225,626 tracks from 985
                    playlists on Spotify that are associated with sleep. They
                    used Spotify's API to compare the audio features of the
                    sleep tracks to audio features of music from a dataset
                    representing music in general.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This analysis showed that sleep music tends to be quieter
                    and slower than other music. It also more often lacks lyrics
                    and more often features acoustic instruments. However,
                    despite these trends, the researchers found considerable
                    diversity in the musical features of sleep music,
                    identifying six distinct sub-categories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Three of the sub-categories, including ambient music, align
                    with the typical characteristics identified for sleep music.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, music in the other three subcategories was louder
                    and had a higher degree of energy than average sleep music.
                    These tracks included several popular songs, including
                    "Dynamite" by the band BTS, and "lovely (with Khalid)" by
                    Billie Eilish and Khalid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Overall, this study suggests that there is no
                    "one-size-fits-all" when it comes to the music people choose
                    for sleep. The findings could help inform future development
                    of music-based strategies to help people sleep.

                    Fast-forward to March 2023. On March 4, Florence Débarre, an
                    evolutionary biologist at Sorbonne University in Paris,
                    spotted some data that had been uploaded to GISAID, a
                    website that allows researchers to share genetic data to
                    help them study and track viruses that cause infectious
                    diseases. The data appeared to have been uploaded in June
                    2022. It seemed to have been collected by Gao and his
                    colleagues for their February 2022 study, although it had
                    not been included in the actual paper.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This finding was a really big deal, not because it
                    proves the presence of an infected animal (it doesn't). But
                    it does put animals—raccoon dogs and other susceptible
                    species—into the exact location at the market with the
                    virus. And not with humans," Angela Rasmussen, a virologist
                    at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada and a coauthor
                    of the report, tweeted on March 21.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There's more drama to this story. Débarre and her
                    colleagues say they told Gao's team their findings on March
                    10. The next day, Gao's team's data disappeared from GISAID,
                    and Débarre's team took their findings to the World Health
                    Organization. The WHO convened two meetings to discuss both
                    teams' results with the Scientific Advisory Group for the
                    Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO).

                    Identified by David Smith, a nonprofessional mathematician
                    who describes himself as an "imaginative tinkerer of
                    shapes," and reported in a paper posted online March 20 at
                    arXiv.org,
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10798"

                    — a bunch of smaller kite shapes stuck together. That's a
                    type of shape that hadn't been studied closely in the search
                    for einsteins, says Chaim Goodman-Strauss of the National
                    Museum of Mathematics in New York City, one of a group of
                    trained mathematicians and computer scientists Smith teamed
                    up with to study the hat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's a surprisingly simple polygon. Before this work, if
                    you'd asked what an einstein would look like,
                    Goodman-Strauss says, "I would've drawn some crazy,
                    squiggly, nasty thing."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And the hat isn't the end. Researchers should continue
                    the hunt for additional einsteins, says computer scientist
                    Craig Kaplan of the University of Waterloo in Canada, a
                    coauthor of the study. "Now that we've unlocked the door,
                    hopefully other new shapes will come along."

                    Increasing levels of light pollution means Earth's surface
                    has almost no practical locations for astronomical
                    observatories, a group of astronomers said on Monday.

                    Artificial light emitted from buildings, streetlights, and
                    reflected from satellite constellations are making the night
                    sky brighter for earth-bound skywatchers. The Milky Way was
                    visible to pretty much everyone less than 100 years ago, but
                    is now drowned out by human-made light to most,

                    almost no more remote places available on Earth that
                    simultaneously meet all the characteristics needed to
                    install an observatory (namely, the absence of light
                    pollution, a high number of clear nights, and good seeing),"

                    global agreement to limit artificial light. Light pollution
                    should be treated in the same way that other types of
                    pollutants, like greenhouse gases, they argued. Governments
                    around the world should and can tackle light pollution in
                    the same ways they address climate change: with
                    international treaties and goals to restrict levels of other
                    pollutants.

                    The study also finds that top earners are more likely to
                    leave smaller city than larger ones, and that these
                    overperformers tend overwhelmingly to move to the largest
                    cities. The disproportionate out-migration of the most
                    successful individuals from smaller cities results in a
                    reinforcement process that takes away many of the most
                    promising people in less populous regions while adding them
                    to larger cities.

                    [...] "Urban science has largely focused on city averages.
                    The established approach just looked at one datapoint per
                    city, for example average income. With their focus on
                    averages, prior studies overlooked the stark inequalities
                    that exist within cities when making predictions about how
                    urban growth affects the life experiences of city dwellers",
                    says Marc Keuschnigg.

                  <p>
                    With respect to urban inequality, the study draws attention
                    to the partial exclusion of most city dwellers from the
                    socioeconomic benefits of growing cities. Their lifestyle,
                    different than among the urban elite, benefits less from
                    geographical location. When accounting for the cost of
                    living in larger cities, many big-city dwellers will in fact
                    be worse off as compared to similar people living in smaller
                    places.

                    "my career as an entrepreneur happened quite by accident." A
                    brilliant scientist, business leader and philanthropist,
                    Gordon co-founded and led two pioneering technology
                    enterprises, Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, and, with
                    his wife, Betty, created one of the largest private
                    grantmaking foundations in the U.S., the Gordon and Betty
                    Moore Foundation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He may argue that his career as an entrepreneur happened by
                    accident, but his world-changing contributions did not.
                    Never one to trumpet his own accomplishments, Gordon wasn't
                    able to dissuade others from celebrating his wide and
                    long-reaching legacy: the revolutionary technologies and
                    breakthroughs, a long and generous history of philanthropy,
                    and the very culture of experimentation, invention and
                    relentless progress that now defines Silicon Valley.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It took decades for Gordon to be able to speak with a
                    straight face of his eponymous "Moore's Law," the prophetic
                    1965 observation that became a cornerstone principle of
                    innovation and driving force for the exponential pace of
                    technological progress in the modern world. Gordon later
                    observed that he had looked it up and was pleasantly
                    surprised to find more references on the internet to
                    "Moore's Law" than to "Murphy's Law."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dubbed a "quiet revolutionary" by his biographers, Gordon
                    always worked in the absence of any pretense or desire for
                    recognition, driven instead by an exceptional curiosity,

                    Gordon was always a visionary. Even at the start of his
                    career, he keenly recognized the impact that the
                    technologies he was developing would have on the world. And
                    at an industry event in 1979, he told an Intel audience: "We
                    are bringing about the next great revolution in the history
                    of mankind — the transition to the electronic age." (<em
                      >Moore's Law</em
                    >, Thackray, Brock and Jones).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although Gordon was reluctant to spotlight his own
                    contributions, his biographers have been less reticent about
                    attribution. Gordon is simply, they argue, "the most
                    important thinker and doer in the story of silicon
                    electronics."

                    Chocolate bars, crisps and fries - why can't we just ignore
                    them in the supermarket? Researchers at the Max Planck
                    Institute for Metabolism Research in Cologne, in
                    collaboration with Yale University, have now shown that
                    foods with a high fat and sugar content change our brain: If
                    we regularly eat even small amounts of them, the brain
                    learns to consume precisely these foods in the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To test this hypothesis, the researchers gave one
                    group of volunteers a small pudding containing a lot of fat
                    and sugar per day for eight weeks in addition to their
                    normal diet. The other group received a pudding that
                    contained the same number of calories but less fat. The
                    volunteer's brain activity was measured before and during
                    the eight weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The brain's response to high-fat and high-sugar foods was
                    greatly increased in the group that ate the high-sugar and
                    high-fat pudding after eight weeks. This particularly
                    activated the dopaminergic system, the region in the brain
                    responsible for motivation and reward. "Our measurements of
                    brain activity showed that the brain rewires itself through
                    the consumption of chips and co. It subconsciously learns to
                    prefer rewarding food. Through these changes in the brain,
                    we will unconsciously always prefer the foods that contain a
                    lot of fat and sugar," explains Marc Tittgemeyer, who led
                    the study.

                    does still upset the occasional Mustangophile. And there's
                    an electric Transit van for the trades. But its electric
                    vehicle division will lose $3 billion this year as it

                    internal combustion engine-powered Fords (including hybrids
                    and plug-in hybrids) falling under Ford Blue. The move was
                    in large part to placate investors and analysts, no doubt

                    [...] The drone used in this research is made by a company
                    called Voliro, and it's a tricopter that uses rotating
                    thruster nacelles that move independently of the body of the
                    drone. It may not shock you to learn that Voliro (which has,
                    in the past, made some really weird flying robots) is a
                    startup with its roots in the Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH
                    Zurich, the same place where the mine-detecting drone
                    research is taking place.

                    [...] Testing with metallic (nonexplosive) targets showed
                    that this system does very well, even in areas with
                    obstacles, overhead occlusion, and significant slope.
                    Whether it's ultimately field-useful or not will require
                    some further investigation, but because the platform itself
                    is commercial, off-the-shelf hardware, there's a bit more
                    room for optimism than there otherwise might be.

                    While programmers today take multiplication for granted,
                    most microprocessors in the 1970s could only add and
                    subtract — multiplication required a slow and tedious loop
                    implemented in assembly code. One of the nice features of
                    the Intel 8086 processor (1978) was that it provided machine
                    instructions for multiplication,2 able to multiply 8-bit or
                    16-bit numbers with a single instruction. Internally, the
                    8086 still performed a loop, but the loop was implemented in
                    microcode: faster and transparent to the programmer. Even
                    so, multiplication was a slow operation, about 24 to 30
                    times slower than addition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this blog post, I explain the multiplication process
                    inside the 8086, analyze the microcode that it used, and
                    discuss the hardware circuitry that helped it out.3 My
                    analysis is based on reverse-engineering the 8086 from die
                    photos. The die photo below shows the chip under a
                    microscope. I've labeled the key functional blocks; the ones
                    that are important to this post are darker. At the left, the
                    ALU (Arithmetic/Logic Unit) performs the arithmetic
                    operations at the heart of multiplication: addition and
                    shifts. Multiplication also uses a few other hardware
                    features: the X register, the F1 flag, and a loop counter.

                    Subel said the findings have important implications for
                    scientific deep learning, and even suggest that some things
                    scientists have learned from studying machine learning in
                    other contexts, like classification of static images, may
                    not apply to scientific machine learning.

                    might result in improvements and patches flowing back
                    upstream. It looks like the answer here is an increasingly
                    firm <em>no</em>, but not because Russian developers aren't
                    offering them. They are — but their efforts are being
                    rebuffed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This seems backward to us: the aim of sanctions is to
                    impose additiuonal costs on the bad activities of hostile
                    nations, or to cause them to reconsider their bad behavior.
                    The aim is to make these countries better behaved and
                    <em>more</em> cooperative with others. Code sharing is
                    <em>good</em> behavior: it takes effort to share your code,
                    and it benefits everyone with whom it is shared. Refusing
                    code contributions because they are from aggressive actors
                    does not hurt or hinder any Russian organization. It doesn't
                    matter what uses the companies offering it have for the code
                    they are sharing. It's irrelevant if the uses are military
                    or peaceful civilian ones.

                    Understanding growth strategies also helps explain why some
                    dinosaurs got enormous while others stayed small. Body size
                    can affect everything from how long an animal lives to how
                    many offspring it has, explained
                    <a

                    >, an evolutionary biologist and doctoral student at the
                    University of Chicago. Yet, "surprisingly, we don't have a
                    lot of information [about] the key developmental or genetic
                    mechanisms underlying body size variation across animals,"
                    he said. Studies like D'Emic's start to open that black box.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Past studies have often suggested that a fast peak
                    growth rate is the key to size in dinosaurs, birds and
                    mammals. But the new analysis found that theropods were
                    instead just as likely to control the duration of their
                    growth — an alternative strategy previously identified in
                    only a few groups, including crocodiles and some lizards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What D'Emic and his colleagues found in theropods might
                    eventually turn out to be more the rule than the exception.
                    In their paper, they noted that previous studies of growth
                    strategies have often been limited comparisons of a few
                    species rather than comprehensive studies of lineages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "My hunch would be that once other groups of animals are
                    studied, we're going to find the same thing," he said.
                    "We're going to find that evolution just takes the path of
                    least resistance" and uses whatever strategy is easiest.

                  and use their teeny xG27 SoC to make medical and wearable

                    Miniaturizing tech is a perpetual challenge for wearable
                    makers. The smaller the device, the better it is for
                    wearability. The thing is, that usually comes at the expense
                    of battery life. However, Silicon Labs is hoping its latest
                    xG27 chipset is small and energy-efficient enough to spark
                    some big ideas in the medical tech space — like a saliva
                    reader that's so tiny it can be mounted onto a tooth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Silicon Labs, the xG27 family of SoCs consists
                    of the BG27 and the MG27. Both are built around the ARM
                    Cortex M33 processor, but the BG27 focuses on Bluetooth,
                    while the MG27 supports Zigbee and other protocols. As for
                    how small these chips are, the xG27 SoCs range from
                    2mm-squared to 5mm-squared — roughly the width of a No. 2
                    pencil's lead tip to the width of the pencil itself. It's
                    not the world's smallest Bluetooth chip, but Silicon Labs
                    spokesperson Sam Ponedal tells <em>The Verge</em> that's
                    only by "fractions of a millimeter."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is neat from a technical perspective, but what's cooler
                    is the BG27 is currently being used to develop an actual
                    product — the aforementioned tooth-mounted wearable sensor.
                    <a href="https://www.lurahealth.com/">Lura Health</a>, a
                    medical device maker, says it's using the chip for its
                    "salivary diagnostic sensor." The sensor is small enough to
                    be glued to a molar (or placed inside a "<a
                      href="https://www.lurahealth.com/#:~:text=Smart%20Retainers%C2%A0and%20Aligners"
                      >smart retainer</a
                    >") with the intent of continually monitoring a patient's
                    saliva. That, in turn, would allow dentists and clinicians
                    to potentially test for more than 1,000 health conditions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As for other use cases, Silicon Labs says its chips
                    are good candidates for medical patches, continuous glucose
                    monitors, and wearable EKGs. That's because they can operate
                    on as low as 0.8 volts and can switch to a "shelf mode" that
                    reduces energy use during transportation and while stored on
                    shelves. These features aren't quite as appealing in
                    consumer wearables, but it opens the door for greater
                    wearable use in hospitals and clinical settings.

                    [...] noyb argues that the only long-term fix for this issue
                    is either reform of U.S. surveillance law to provide
                    "baseline protections for foreigners to support their tech
                    industry". Or data localization — meaning U.S. providers
                    would be forced to host foreign data outside of the country.
                    And we are seeing some moves in that direction (<a
                      href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/08/with-project-clover-tiktok-touts-new-eu-data-privacy-and-security-efforts/"
                      >such as from TikTok</a
                    >, which faces even greater scrutiny than Facebook over
                    matters connected to national security).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's not clear if data localization is much of a fix for
                    Meta's (or indeed TikTok's) problems, though — given how
                    data-mining users is central to their ad-targeting business
                    model. ("It is well known that due to its US–based system,
                    Meta is categorically unable to ensure that the data of
                    European citizens is not intercepted by US Intelligence
                    agencies," noyb suggests.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the meanwhile, a final
                    <a
                      href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/11/facebook-europe-shut-down-delay/"
                      >decision on whether to suspend Meta's EU-US data
                      transfers</a
                    >
                    remains pending from its lead EU DPA, the Irish Data
                    Protection Commission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So it really is down to the wire on which will come first: A
                    new EU-US data transfers sticking plaster — which would
                    reset the legal challenges and buy Meta a new round of
                    operational breathing space in Europe — or a final DPA order
                    to stop transferring EU users' data over the pond. Although,
                    in the latter case, Meta would certainly appeal a suspension
                    order — so the most likely outcome is that Meta will get to
                    kick the can down the road yet again and European privacy
                    advocates will have to gird themselves for a fresh round of
                    legal challenges, hoping the CJEU will be even faster on
                    pulling the trigger this time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    EU DPAs have shown extreme reluctance to enforce the law
                    around data transfers, dragged their feet when it came to
                    acting on the Court of Justice's July 2020 decision striking
                    down Privacy Shield, for example. So the same scenario could
                    well repeat next time around, creating a cycle of
                    law-breaking that's almost never enforced — and a parody
                    where EU users' fundamental rights should be.

                    Edge Canary – both experimental browser builds – led to the
                    presentation in the Edge browser window of a banner graphic
                    celebrating the merits of Edge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Microsoft Edge runs on the same technology as Chrome, with
                    the added trust of Microsoft," the banner proclaims atop a
                    button labeled "Browse securely now."

                    how this ad surfaced. Edge appears to display the banner by
                    itself when the user surfs to the Chrome download page on
                    Google.com, which is just a little bit aggressive.

                    confirmed to The Register that he could reproduce the ad,
                    which was said to be written in HTML but wasn't placed "in"
                    the page. He described the ad as its own browser window
                    that, surprisingly, was viewable with Edge's "Inspect"
                    option for viewing source code.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our source speculated the ad was implemented in a way that
                    pushes down the "Content area" – the space where loaded web
                    pages get rendered – to make space for a second rendering
                    area that holds the ad.

                The most notorious PFAS chemicals – PFOA, the Teflon chemical,
                and PFOS, an ingredient in 3M's Scotchgard – were phased out in
                the U.S. under pressure from the Environmental Protection Agency
                after revelations of their hidden hazards. (They are still
                permitted in items imported to this country.) Numerous studies
                link these and closely related PFAS chemicals to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Testicular, kidney, liver and pancreatic cancer.</li>
                <li>Reproductive problems</li>
                <li>Weakened childhood immunity</li>
                <li>Low birth weight</li>
                <li>Endocrine disruption</li>
                <li>Increased cholesterol</li>
                <li>Weight gain in children and dieting adults</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                PFOA, PFOS and the related phased-out compounds are called "long
                chain" chemicals because they contain eight carbon atoms. Since
                these chemicals have been phased out, the EPA and the <a

                contaminated with the highly toxic fluorinated compounds known
                as PFAS continues to grow at an alarming rate. As of June 2022,
                2,858 locations in 50 states and two territories are known to be

                    alleged to be "Pompompurin," the administrator of the
                    infamous and popular Breach Forums. Days after the arrest,
                    the cybercrime website's new administrator announced that

                    new admin, known as "Baphomet," wrote in the official
                    Telegram channel. "I will be taking down the forum, as I
                    believe we can assume that nothing is safe anymore. I know
                    that everyone wants the forum up, but there is no value in
                    short term gain for what will likely be a long term loss by
                    propping up Breached as it is."

                    [...] "I want to make it clear, that while this initial
                    announcement is not positive, it's not the end. I'm going to
                    setup another Telegram group for those who want to see what
                    follows. You are allowed to hate me, and disagree with my
                    decision but I promise what is to come will be better for us
                    all," Baphomet wrote. "Ggive (sic) me 24 hours to get some
                    rest and give thought to how we move on from here. I will be
                    back online after that, and we will talk. I am going
                    nowhere."

                    key to prove it was genuinely written by them, they wrote
                    that they were able to confirm that the authorities have

                    [...] Shortly after the Sun dips below the horizon, look to

                    Dwindling sunlight might make them hard to see with the

                    binoculars. Just make sure the Sun is below the horizon so
                    you don't potentially harm your eyes by looking at it
                    through binoculars.

                    Think of the worst invasive species you know. Kudzu:
                    smothering trees and houses, growing a foot a day. Burmese
                    pythons: stripping the Everglades of small animals.

                    They all came from somewhere else, arrived with no natural
                    predators, outcompeted local flora and fauna, and took over
                    whole ecosystems. But they all have their limitations: Kudzu
                    dies in a hard freeze, carp can't tolerate salt water, and
                    pythons can't cover long distances very fast. (Thankfully.)

                    Now imagine a species with all those benefits—foreign
                    origin, no enemies—and no roadblocks to dominance: One that
                    is indifferent to temperature, comfortable in many
                    landscapes, able to run a lot faster than you, and muscular
                    enough to leave a big dent in your car. That describes any
                    of the possibly 6 million feral hogs in the United States,
                    the most intractable invasives that most people have never
                    heard of.<br />[...]<br />USDA research estimates that, on

                    Researchers have analyzed samples of asteroid Ryugu
                    collected by the Japanese Space Agency's Hayabusa2
                    spacecraft and found uracil—one of the informational units
                    that make up RNA, the molecules that contain the
                    instructions for how to build and operate living organisms.
                    Nicotinic acid, also known as Vitamin B3 or niacin, which is
                    an important cofactor for metabolism in living organisms,
                    was also detected in the same samples.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This discovery by an international team, led by Associate
                    Professor Yasuhiro Oba at Hokkaido University, adds to the
                    evidence that important building blocks for life are created
                    in space and could have been delivered to Earth by
                    meteorites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Scientists have previously found nucleobases and vitamins
                    in certain carbon-rich meteorites, but there was always the
                    question of contamination by exposure to the Earth's
                    environment," Oba explained. "Since the Hayabusa2 spacecraft
                    collected two samples directly from asteroid Ryugu and
                    delivered them to Earth in sealed capsules, contamination
                    can be ruled out."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We found uracil in the samples in small amounts, in the
                    range of 6–32 parts per billion (ppb), while vitamin B3 was
                    more abundant, in the range of 49–99 ppb," Oba elaborated.
                    "Other biological molecules were found in the sample as
                    well, including a selection of amino acids, amines and
                    carboxylic acids, which are found in proteins and
                    metabolism, respectively." The compounds detected are
                    similar but not identical to those previously discovered in
                    carbon-rich meteorites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The discovery of uracil in the samples from Ryugu lends
                    strength to current theories regarding the source of
                    nucleobases in the early Earth," Oba concludes. "The
                    OSIRIS-REx mission by NASA will be returning samples from
                    asteroid Bennu this year, and a comparative study of the
                    composition of these asteroids will provide further data to
                    build on these theories."

                    The Soviet Union created the Baikonur Cosmodrome in 1955 to
                    serve as a test site for intercontinental ballistic
                    missiles. A few years later it became the world's first
                    spaceport with the launch of the historic Sputnik 1 and
                    Vostok 1 missions. The sprawling cosmodrome was a mainstay
                    of the Soviet space program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia began to lease
                    the spaceport from the government of Kazakhstan and
                    currently has an agreement to use the facilities through the
                    year 2050. Russia pays an annual lease fee of about $100
                    million. Neither country is particularly happy with the
                    relationship; the Kazakh government feels like it is
                    under-compensated, and the Russian government would like it
                    to be in its own country, which is why it has moved in
                    recent years to build a new launch site for most of its
                    rockets in the Far East of Russia, at Vostochny.

                  <p>
                    [...] Earlier this month a Kazakh news site, KZ24, reported
                    that the Republic of Kazakhstan had seized the property of
                    TsENKI, the Center for Utilization of Ground-based Space
                    Infrastructure, in Kazakhstan. This firm, which is a
                    subsidiary of Roscosmos, is responsible for launch pads and
                    ground support equipment for the Russian space corporation.

                      >According to the report</a
                    >, which was translated for Ars by Rob Mitchell, TsENKI is
                    barred from removing any assets or materials from
                    Kazakhstan.

                    [...] Russia has already spent nearly $1 billion on the
                    development of the new Soyuz-5 rocket and plans for its
                    launch site and ground services. When

                    >
                    back in 2017, it was slated for a debut in 2021. Now it is
                    unlikely to debut before at least 2024—and given the current
                    dispute with Kazakhstan, it likely will be delayed much
                    longer into the future.

                    [...] Finding out whether another being can feel pain is
                    really difficult, even when it comes to humans. Until the
                    mid-1980s babies in the US were routinely operated on
                    with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23548489/"
                      >little or no anesthesia</a
                    >, due to the mistaken belief that very young infants were
                    incapable of perceiving pain. In one famous case, a
                    premature baby in Maryland born in 1985 underwent open heart
                    surgery without any anesthesia at all. When Jill Lawson, the
                    boy's mother, later <a
                      href="https://dolor.org.co/biblioteca/articulos/MOderna%20historia%20dolor%20pediatrico.pdf"
                      >questioned her doctors</a
                    >, she was told that premature babies couldn't feel pain—a
                    scientific misunderstanding that was later overturned partly
                    thanks to the campaigning of people like Lawson.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If scientists can misunderstand pain in humans for so long,
                    what hope do we have in figuring it out in insects? When
                    searching for answers, there are a handful of signs
                    researchers look for. One is the presence of
                    nociceptors—neurons that respond to painful stimuli from the
                    outside world. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] If we're going to farm animals that are candidates for
                    sentience, then there should be welfare standards, says
                    Birch. Right now there are no widely recognized welfare
                    guidelines for farmed insects, and few laws that
                    specifically require insect farmers to meet certain welfare
                    standards. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] An even bigger quandary is how insects should be
                    slaughtered. In the EU, most animals <a
                      href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2012/120375/LDM_BRI(2012)120375_REV2_EN.pdf"
                      >must be</a
                    >
                    stunned unconscious before they're killed, but no such
                    regulations exist for insects. [...] "Trying to make sure
                    that we are killing quickly and efficiently, given the level
                    of uncertainty, is perhaps one of the most important things
                    we can do," Fischer says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The issue for Fischer isn't whether we should farm insects
                    at all—it's about taking insect welfare more seriously and
                    making sure the industry does too. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And that means two things. One, it's about more work on
                    animal sentience—in particular the handful of species that
                    are most commonly farmed. "For at least these insect
                    species, we would want to have some certainty of what
                    constitutes humane slaughtering procedures and what are
                    acceptable rearing conditions and so on," says Chittka. "We
                    need that research now."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's also about widening our sense of which animals deserve
                    our compassion. It's easy to look into the eyes of a dog, or
                    a chimp, and intuit that these animals have feelings that we
                    can influence. It's much more difficult to look upon a tray
                    of mealworms and make the same observation. If we're going
                    to start farming these animals en masse, though, the kindest
                    thing to do might be to err on the side of caution.

                    U.S. regulators last year put into place rules that stopped
                    Nvidia from selling its two most advanced chips, the A100
                    and newer H100, to Chinese customers. Such chips are crucial
                    to developing generative AI technologies like OpenAI's
                    ChatGPT and similar products.
                  </p>

                    >
                    that reduced some capabilities of the A100 to make the A800
                    legal for export to China.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Tuesday, the company confirmed that it has similarly
                    developed a China-export version of its H100 chip. The new
                    chip, called the H800, is being used by the cloud computing
                    units of Chinese technology firms such as Alibaba Group
                    Holding, Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings, a company
                    spokesperson said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    U.S. regulators last fall imposed rules to slow China's
                    development in key technology sectors such as semiconductors
                    and artificial intelligence, aiming to hobble the country's
                    efforts to modernize its military.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rules around artificial intelligence chips imposed a
                    test that bans those with both powerful computing
                    capabilities and high chip-to-chip data transfer rates.
                    Transfer speed is important when training artificial
                    intelligence models on huge amounts of data because slower
                    transfer rates mean more training time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A chip industry source in China told Reuters the H800 mainly
                    reduced the chip-to-chip data transfer rate to about half
                    the rate of the flagship H100.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Nvidia spokesperson declined to say how the
                    China-focused H800 differs from the H100, except that "our
                    800 series products are fully compliant with export control
                    regulations."

                    A tiny satellite with a drag chute built by a team of
                    students has been held up as one small possible solution to
                    the thorny issue of space junk caused by defunct hardware
                    cluttering up Earth's orbit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    SBUDNIC, a "Sputnik-like CubeSat," was built by students at
                    Brown University, Rhode Island, from low-cost commercial
                    off-the-shelf parts. It has successfully demonstrated the
                    use of a simple drag sail that helps to degrade the
                    satellite's orbit and push it back into the planet's
                    atmosphere faster than would otherwise have occurred.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The idea behind
                    <a href="https://sbudnic.space/">SBUDNIC</a> was to
                    demonstrate how future satellites could avoid adding to this
                    problem by including a mechanism to help de-orbit them at
                    the end of their life span. The aerodynamic drag device
                    pulls the satellite out of orbit approximately three times
                    faster than comparable satellites, according to Brown
                    University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The satellite itself is a 3U Cubesat (where 1U is 10
                    cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, not to be confused with a datacenter
                    rack unit). According to details given by the university, it
                    includes a $10 Arduino microprocessor, 65 AA Energizer
                    lithium batteries and a variety of 3D printed parts produced
                    with consumer-grade printers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also 3D printed is the drag sail, made from Kapton polyimide
                    film, which apparently has the right combination of
                    properties to withstand extreme temperature and vibration.
                    This was folded flat along the satellite's frame prior to
                    deployment, using spring-loaded structural masts made of
                    thin aluminum tubing designed to extend out upon triggering
                    of the release mechanism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Initial computational predictions suggest that the
                    drag device will decrease the orbital lifetime of SBUDNIC
                    from over 20 years to as few as 6.5 years, depending on
                    fluctuations of atmospheric density.

                    By scanning and distributing digital books to readers free
                    of charge, the lawsuit claims Internet Archive is exploiting
                    "the investments that publishers have made in their books,
                    and it does so through a business model that is designed to
                    free-ride on the work of others." The book publishers say
                    this practice makes Internet Archive "nothing more than a
                    mass copier and distributor of bootleg works."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The publishers received support for their lawsuit from the
                    Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers.
                    Maria Pallante, chief executive of the association,
                    criticized Internet Archive's practices, telling the Wall
                    Street Journal, "If this conduct is normalized, there would
                    be no point to the Copyright Act." She added, "It would
                    effectively render the rights of authors, including the
                    right to market and monetize their works, meaningless."

                    It looks to be the end of the line for NASA's Aeronomy of
                    Ice in the Mesosphere, or AIM, spacecraft. The mission
                    launched on April 25, 2007, as part of the Small Explorer
                    program (the 90th such mission since 1958). The satellite
                    featured three science instruments designed to study polar
                    mesospheric clouds (PMCs) that form high above Earth in the
                    polar regions.

                  <p>
                    The satellite was put into orbit 312 miles up. Data from the
                    long-running mission helped scientists better understand the
                    formation of these unique clouds, also called night-shining
                    or noctilucent clouds, and was featured in 379 peer-reviewed
                    scientific papers over the years.

                    AIM had a planned mission duration of just 26 months but has
                    been operating mostly issue-free for nearly 16 years. In
                    2019, however, NASA noticed the satellite's batteries were
                    starting to degrade but were still functional enough to
                    continue to collect a significant amount of data and return
                    it to Earth.

                    the craft's battery has reached a point where it is no
                    longer able to receive commands or collect data. The space
                    agency will monitor the satellite for a two-week period and
                    attempt to reboot it, but it isn't looking good.

                    HTTPS and TELNET support soon followed. According to
                    Stenberg, curl was initially released under the General
                    Public License (GPL) but was put under an Mozilla Public
                    License (MPL) by the end of 1998. In 2001, curl added a new
                    license that's
                    <a href="https://curl.se/docs/copyright.html"
                      >close but not identical to the MIT license</a
                    >, alongside the MPL license, which was dropped in 2002.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The project has become a juggernaut. Stenberg says that his
                    goal has been simply to keep improving the code over time.
                    And in the years he and other contributors have worked on
                    it, curl grew and grew, reaching hundreds of millions of
                    installations in 2010. Today it's estimated to have been
                    installed more than ten billion times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As of the start of 2023, curl consisted of 155,100 lines of
                    code. It incorporates contributions from

                Despite technology bringing new recording media formats and

                    Metallica has bought a majority stake in Furnace Record
                    Pressing, one of the biggest and most important vinyl
                    records companies in the U.S. If anyone had any doubts about
                    the growth of the vinyl sales, which last year outpaced CD
                    sales for the first time since 1987, Metallica's new
                    purchase just gave them a very loud reminder that what's old
                    is new again.

                    Vinyl records are experiencing a renaissance among music
                    lovers. Although Metallica hasn't released a new album since
                    Hardwired...To Self-Destruct in 2016, it sold more than
                    387,000 vinyl albums in 2022, according to data from
                    Billboard. That year, it ranked sixth on the list of most
                    albums sold in the U.S., topping the 337,000 albums it sold
                    in 2021. The price Metallica paid for Furnace was not
                    disclosed; members of the band will now sit on Furnace's
                    board.

                    Metallica is expected to release its first album in seven
                    years sometime over the next few weeks, setting the stage
                    for the band to sell to many, many more vinyl records in
                    2023.

                    The cuts will take place in coming weeks and are mainly
                    concentrated in Amazon's web, HR and advertising team. Staff

                    CEO Andy Jassy said the decision was made to ensure the
                    company remained "streamlined" as tough market conditions

                    Six days ago, another massive tech giant, Facebook owner
                    Meta, also announced mass job redundancies. Meta chief
                    executive officer Mark Zuckerberg told employees that his
                    company was laying off another 10,000 employees and closing
                    about 5000 additional open roles in its own second major
                    round of job cuts.

                    Closer to home, Australia has also been pummelled by the
                    tough economic conditions. Earlier this month, ASX-listed
                    software firm Xero announced that it was going to reduce its
                    headcount by 700 to 800 roles, which was a 15 per cent cut
                    to the overall workforce. A few days earlier, software giant
                    Atlassian slashed 500 roles, which represents five per cent
                    of its total global workforce. Another software development
                    company, Kinde, laid off 28.5 per cent of staff at the end
                    of last month.

                I would certainly feel 'streamlined' or perhaps in free fall if
                I no longer had a job.

                    Wang and Fei suggest that the violent environment of early
                    Earth would have actually created the circumstances that
                    would turn the mantle into a giant "pour over" coffee
                    apparatus, allowing percolation of liquid metal through an
                    interconnected network. They analyzed the chemical exchanges
                    during this percolation process. Their results would account
                    for iron-loving elements being left behind in the mantle,
                    shedding light on a longstanding geochemistry question.

                    the capital of Kigali. Zipline drones now serve 3,400 health
                    centers and over 45 million people.

                    The company is planning to complete about 1 million
                    deliveries by the end of 2023. By 2025, the company hopes to
                    operate more flights annually than almost all major U.S.
                    airlines.

                    long-range deliveries. The company claims to reduce carbon
                    emissions of deliveries by 97% when compared to gas cars.
                    Zipline drones now fly in seven different countries and
                    three U.S. states. In 2024, the company plans to begin
                    operations in Michigan and Washington with more states to
                    follow.

                    [...] Making Google honor its previous leave agreements
                    isn't just about employees getting paid when they have
                    medical or family issues; it's also about having continual
                    medical care when they need it most. As part of Google's
                    (seemingly discarded) plan to offer employees every perk
                    imaginable, the company has

                    While employees' severance packages might come with a few
                    more months of health insurance, being fired means instantly
                    losing access to Google's facilities. If that's where a
                    laid-off Googler's primary care doctor works, that person is
                    out of luck, and some employees told CNBC they lost access
                    to their doctors the second the layoff email arrived.

                    The misinformation campaign was carried out by a group of
                    conspirators, prosecutors said, including a man in his 20s
                    who called himself Ricky Vaughn. On Monday he will go on
                    trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn under his real
                    name, Douglass Mackey, after being charged with conspiring
                    to spread misinformation designed to deprive others of their

                    disinformation. While some of those attempts were

                    This week, NASA announced it has selected the company
                    Firefly Aerospace to develop a commercial lander for the far
                    side of the moon. The lander, called Blue Ghost, will be
                    used to deliver several NASA payloads to the moon, including
                    a radio observation mission which is placed on the far side
                    of the moon to minimize the radio noise coming from Earth.
                    This natural radio quiet zone will let the Lunar Surface
                    Electromagnetics Experiment-Night (LuSEE-Night) telescope
                    detect faint radio waves from an early period of the
                    universe known as the cosmic dark ages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As well as LuSEE-Night, Firefly will also be tasked
                    with carrying a communications and data relay satellite
                    called Lunar Pathfinder, which is a collaboration between
                    NASA and the European Space Agency, and which will be
                    deployed into orbit before the lander sets down on the
                    moon's surface. In addition, the NASA User Terminal payload
                    will assist with communications, and there will be up to
                    seven other payloads from private companies included as
                    well.

                  <p>
                    The aim is for Firefly to launch its lunar mission, Blue

                  <p>
                    Air pollution is a major public health problem: The World
                    Health Organization has estimated that it leads to over 4
                    million premature deaths worldwide annually. Still, it is
                    not always extensively measured. But now an MIT research
                    team is rolling out an open-source version of a low-cost,
                    mobile pollution detector that could enable people to track
                    air quality more widely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The detector, called Flatburn, can be made by 3D printing or
                    by ordering inexpensive parts. The researchers have now
                    tested and calibrated it in relation to existing
                    state-of-the-art machines, and are publicly releasing all
                    the information about it - how to build it, use it, and
                    interpret the data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Flatburn concept at Senseable City Lab dates back to
                    about 2017, when MIT researchers began prototyping a mobile
                    pollution detector, originally to be deployed on garbage
                    trucks in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The detectors are
                    battery-powered and rechargable, either from power sources
                    or a solar panel, with data stored on a card in the device
                    that can be accessed remotely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In both cases, the detectors were set up to measure
                    concentrations of fine particulate matter as well as
                    nitrogen dioxide, over an area of about 10 meters. Fine
                    particular matter refers to tiny particles often associated
                    with burning matter, from power plants, internal combustion
                    engines in autos and fires, and more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The goal is for community groups or individual citizens
                    anywhere to be able to measure local air pollution, identify
                    its sources, and, ideally, create feedback loops with
                    officials and stakeholders to create cleaner conditions,"
                    says Carlo Ratti, director of MIT's Senseable City Lab.

                    [...] Living in the Swedish capital Stockholm, the
                    33-year-old regularly travels by rail, not only to visit her
                    family in Luxembourg, but also to her holiday destinations.

                    She favours train travel over flying mainly for
                    environmental reasons. Yet she adds that trains are simply
                    more enjoyable, especially sleeper services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The carbon footprint is just a fraction of a flight.
                    Flying from Stockholm to Hamburg results in around 250kg of
                    carbon dioxide emissions per passenger,

                    By contrast, the C02 released by travelling via
                    electric-powered train is just 26kg.

                    The SJ night train has nine coaches, and capacity to carry
                    400 passengers. Dan Olofsson, head of tendered services at
                    SJ, says the new service was proposed by the Swedish
                    government, "as they wanted to move more people towards
                    climate-friendly travelling, and one of the solutions was
                    the night train between Sweden and Germany".

                  <p>
                    The service is powered by renewable energy, and Mr Olofsson
                    says it is typically being used by Swedes to connect them to
                    other rail services from Hamburg.

                  <p>
                    "Hamburg isn't the main destination for most travellers, but
                    is an important hub for people to reach more destinations in
                    Germany and France and so on," he says.

                    [...] However, depending on the location, and especially if
                    starting from the UK, travelling by train can often be more
                    expensive than flying. Trains fares in the UK can in fact be
                    50% more costly than flights,

                    Musical Bits creates software that creates music, with the
                    support of AI. Our Maisterstück platform uses AI technology
                    to model all layers of creativity of a human composer and
                    implements these layers as reusable and combinable software
                    components. Maisterstück's functionality can be accessed via
                    a service oriented API.

                    The Musical Bits software can create music from real time

                    albums and songs. For example, check out the Frostbite

                Their sound could be described as a keyboard-heavy version of
                viking metal, like a mellower spin of Amon Amarth. Along with
                the song comes an also AI generated video

                has gone into the AI to generate the production, and how much

                lyrics about whiskey") in the foreseeable future and get

                    The alleged Phoenix 2 processor with two Zen 4 cores and
                    four Zen 4c cores has been running MilkyWay@Home client
                    since early March, which indicates that someone within AMD
                    or even outside of the company is test driving the chip.
                    This may be a sign that the CPU will be released in the
                    foreseeable future, though it is unclear when exactly.
                    Meanwhile, based on unofficial information, AMD is set to

                    Whether we're night owls or morning larks, our body clocks
                    are set by the sun. Theoretically, changing day length and
                    light exposure over the course of the year could affect the
                    duration and quality of our sleep. But figuring out how this
                    applies in practice is difficult. Although studies where
                    people assess their own sleep have suggested an increase in
                    sleep duration during winter, objective measures are needed
                    to determine how exactly the seasons affect sleep.

                    disrupted sleep, humans experience longer REM sleep in
                    winter than summer and less deep sleep in autumn.

                    "Possibly one of the most precious achievements in human
                    evolution is an almost invisibility of seasonality on the
                    behavioral level," said Dr Dieter Kunz, corresponding author
                    of the study, based at the Clinic of Sleep &amp;
                    Chronomedicine at the St Hedwig Hospital, Berlin. "In our
                    study we show that human sleep architecture varies
                    substantially across seasons in an adult population living
                    in an urban environment."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Even though the patients were based in an urban
                    environment with low natural light exposure and high light
                    pollution, which should affect any seasonality regulated by
                    light, the scientists found subtle but striking changes
                    across the seasons. Although total sleep time appeared to be
                    about an hour longer in the winter than the summer, this
                    result was not statistically significant. However, REM sleep
                    was 30 minutes longer in the winter than in summer. REM
                    sleep is known to be directly linked to the circadian clock,
                    which is affected by changing light. Although the team
                    acknowledged that these results would need to be validated
                    in a population which experiences no sleep difficulties, the
                    seasonal changes may be even greater in a healthy
                    population.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Seasonality is ubiquitous in any living being on this
                    planet," said Kunz. "Even though we still perform unchanged,
                    over the winter human physiology is down-regulated, with a
                    sensation of 'running-on-empty' in February or March. In
                    general, societies need to adjust sleep habits including
                    length and timing to season, or adjust school and working
                    schedules to seasonal sleep needs."
