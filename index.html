                    [...] In addition to identifying potentially suitable
                    regions, Kamau also determined how production in each
                    individual area could be increased sustainably. "There are
                    two approaches to boosting production," she says. "The first
                    is extensification, which means expanding agricultural
                    areas. The other is intensification, i.e. ramping up
                    cultivation density. Depending on the region, diversified
                    farming practices can help make both extensification and
                    intensification more sustainable. But each approach has its
                    risks."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Which approach is more promising depends on the region in
                    question. Agricultural land in Western Europe, China, parts
                    of India and Brazil as well as Eastern Europe that is
                    already being intensively farmed could benefit from various
                    forms of extensification such as incorporating mixed
                    planting and lowering the cultivation density. While areas
                    in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Brazil, India, Tajikistan
                    as well as Canada, and Australia could benefit from
                    intensification according to the study. Other areas may be
                    suitable for both options, such as most parts of West
                    Africa.

                    Health data campaigners are preparing for a legal challenge
                    to the Â£330 million ($417 million) procurement of the
                    Federated Data Platform (FDP) by NHS England, awarded to US
                    spy-tech firm Palantir last month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The group led by Foxglove alleges there is no lawful basis
                    to create the FDP, as described in procurement documents,
                    within the current legal directions NHS Digital uses to
                    obtain and share data within the NHS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to NHS England, the "data platform" is the
                    software it plans to use to help NHS organizations collate
                    the operational data currently stored in separate systems in
                    order to help staff access the information they need. This
                    data includes the number of beds in a hospital, the size of
                    waiting lists for elective care services, or the
                    availability of medical supplies. The idea is every hospital
                    trust and integrated care system (ICS) will have their own
                    platform, but they will be able to connect and share
                    information between them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The controversial contract is set to last up to seven years.
                    NHS England said the new data platform would deliver better
                    joined-up care for millions of patients, help tackle waiting
                    lists, and reduce hospital discharge delays. Waiting lists
                    in the country have been at record levels since the
                    pandemic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In a statement to The Guardian, NHS England said it
                    has the legal authority to press ahead with the FDP without
                    further legislation and the legal concerns were "totally
                    incorrect."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An NHS spokesperson told the newspaper: "This letter
                    fundamentally misunderstands how the Federated Data Platform
                    will operate and is totally incorrect in both matters of law
                    and fact. The platform will use only existing data legally
                    collected by the NHS to support direct patient care, which
                    is lawful under all relevant data protection regulations."

                    is now working closely with Francesca, introduced the

                    But recently, the issue has reached a "tipping point," says
                    Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California,
                    Berkeley, because AI has grown much more sophisticated,
                    making the potential for harm much more serious. "The threat
                    vector has changed dramatically," says Farid. Creating a
                    convincing deepfake five years ago required hundreds of
                    images, he says, which meant those at greatest risk for
                    being targeted were celebrities and famous people with lots
                    of publicly accessible photos. But now, deepfakes can be
                    created with just one image.

                    Clarke and Morelle, both Democrats from New York, have
                    reintroduced their bills this year. Morelle's now has 18

                    incident involving Francesca came to lightâwhich indicates
                    there could be real legislative momentum to get the bill
                    passed. Then just this week, Representative Kean, one of the

                    [...] Karen Barker, Head of Policy and Research at abrdn
                    Financial Fairness Trust, said, "It is particularly worrying
                    that many in serious financial difficulties continue to take
                    on debt just to pay for essentials. This group is also more
                    likely to borrow from friends and family, meaning their
                    loved ones may be going without to help keep them warm and
                    fed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Financial hardship has ripple effects through communities,
                    and in a small number of extreme cases, some of these
                    'friends' may actually be loan sharks. With headlines
                    showing January's energy bills are going to increase once
                    again, and government support for energy bills not available
                    this winter, there is a risk that those in serious financial
                    difficulties are going to be forced to fall even further
                    into debt to stay afloat."

                    Processors are driven by a clock, which controls the timing
                    of each step inside the chip. In this blog post, I'll
                    examine the clock-generation circuitry inside the Intel 386
                    processor. Earlier processors such as the 8086 (1978) were
                    simpler, using two clock phases internally. The Intel 386
                    processor (1985) was a pivotal development for Intel as it
                    moved x86 to CMOS (as well as being the first 32-bit x86
                    processor). The 386's CMOS circuitry required four clock
                    signals. An external crystal oscillator provided the 386
                    with a single clock signal and the 386's internal circuitry
                    generated four carefully-timed internal clock signals from
                    the external clock.

                    Animals often use vocalizations to warn of nearby danger to
                    others. While this information is generally intended for
                    members of the same species, other species can eavesdrop on
                    the warnings to use the information for their own benefit.
                    Sentinels are animals that have warning calls so widely
                    understood by others that those other species will form
                    groups with them, relying on the sentinels to provide
                    warnings of danger.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, the family Paridae, which are a group of birds
                    that consist of chickadees, tits, and titmice, are known as
                    sentinels because their alarm call for danger, which
                    fittingly sounds like "chick-a-dee-dee-dee," is understood
                    by most other bird species in their mixed-species flocks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Many animals form mixed-species groups, and the thought is
                    that this is an anti-predator behavior," said Henry Pollock,
                    Executive Director of the Southern Plains Land Trust. "There
                    is safety in numbers, and there is a benefit to surrounding
                    yourself with a more diverse set of eyes and ears. However,
                    you have to be able to understand the information that the
                    others around you give to make use of it."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sentinel calls are so readily understood as a signal for
                    danger that researchers wondered whether species that have
                    never heard the call would still get the message. After a
                    recent study found that birds in the Neotropics were
                    responsive to unfamiliar chickadee alarm calls from North
                    America, researchers at the University of Illinois
                    Urbana-Champaign wanted to expand on this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team sought to test if bird communities across three
                    different continents could understand calls for danger from
                    a sentinel they had never encountered beforeâthe
                    dusky-throated antshrike. Antshrikes are birds widely
                    distributed across Central and South America that often act
                    as sentinels in their mixed-species flocks.

                    put roadblocks up before extension <em>updates</em>, which
                    will delay an extension developer's ability to quickly
                    respond to changes. YouTube can instantly switch up its ad
                    delivery system, but once Manifest V3 becomes mandatory,
                    that won't be true for extension developers. If ad blocking
                    is a cat-and-mouse game of updates and counter-updates, then
                    Google will force the mouse to slow down.

                    [...] We've covered this already. But we haven't talked
                    about the other side of the equation: Ad block rules can't
                    be updated quickly anymore. Today, ad blockers and privacy
                    apps can ship filter list updates themselves, often using
                    giant open-source community lists. Manifest V3 will stop
                    this by limiting what Google describes "remotely hosted
                    code." All updates, even to benign things like a filtering
                    list, will need to happen through full extension updates
                    through the Chrome Web Store. They will all be subject to
                    Chrome Web Store reviews process, and that comes with a
                    significant time delay.

                    Engadget's Anthony Ha interviewed some developers in the
                    filtering extension community, and they described a constant
                    cat-and-mouse game with YouTube. Ghostery's director of
                    product and engineering, Krzysztof Modras, said that YouTube
                    is "adapting [its] methods more frequently than ever before.
                    To counteract its changes to ad delivery and ad blocker
                    detection, block lists have to be updated at minimum on a
                    daily basis, and sometimes even more often. While all
                    players in the space are innovating, some ad blockers are
                    simply unable to keep up with these changes."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When Manifest V3 becomes mandatory, those updates that
                    need to arrive "at minimum on a daily basis" will no longer
                    be an option. Limiting remotely hosted code sounds like a
                    totally reasonable limitation until you realize that. like
                    most Manifest V3 changes, it seems carefully crafted to
                    cripple ad blockers more than other extensions. Is a
                    filtering list update, which is essentially just a list of
                    websites, <em>really</em> something that needs to be limited
                    by the "no remotely hosted code" policy?

                    Already equipped with an impressive sonar system, new
                    research reveals that dolphins have an extra ability that
                    evolves as they mature in the space where their baby
                    whiskers once were. The super sense may help them navigate
                    and find hidden food sources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dolphins' sonar ability, known as echolocation, is fairly
                    legendary in the animal kingdom. This ability is so accurate
                    that the mammals, which are technically whales, can use it
                    to distinguish between a golf ball and a ping-pong ball
                    underwater based on the densities of the two objects. But
                    that's not where the creatures' impressive abilities end.

                    They also have eyes that allow them to see in two directions
                    at once; skin that secretes an antibacterial gel to ward off
                    parasites and barnacles; they can get enough thrust to reach
                    30 mph; and they turn off half their brains at a time in
                    order to get rest. A 2019 study also revealed that they have

                    that grant them protection from antibiotic-resistant
                    bacteria. Now, a new study out of the University of Rostock
                    (UR) in Germany adds another impressive skill to the
                    dolphin's roster of powers: the ability to sense weak
                    electric fields.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Two UR researchers took a closer look at the small pits that
                    are left behind after young bottlenose dolphins shed the
                    thin whiskers they are born with. They realized that the
                    pits looked like the same structures that allow sharks to
                    detect electrical fields and designed a study to see if they
                    functioned the same way for the dolphins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They first trained two dolphins at the Nuremberg Zoo to rest
                    their jaws on a metal bar submerged in a pool. Then, they
                    trained them to swim away whenever they sensed an electrical
                    current being produced just above their snouts. One dolphin
                    was able to sense signals down to those measuring just 5.5
                    microvolts/cm, while the other was even more sensitive,
                    picking on a current measuring 2.4 microvolts/cm. One
                    microvolt is equal to one millionth of a volt.

                    Inkscape was used to open the resultant SVG at 72dpi. I then
                    used Gimp to autocrop, canvas expanded to 16000x9000, and
                    saved as an <em>uncompressed</em> PNG.

                    The Emoji wouldn't import to either Gimp or Inkscape. So I
                    viewed the file in Firefox and then printed it to a PDF.

                    In what is a hugely promising sign for securing and boosting
                    food production, a large-scale field study has demonstrated
                    how treating farmland soil with mycorrhizal fungi can
                    improve crop yields of maize by 40%, without the use of any
                    additional fertilizers or pesticides.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the Swiss study, researchers mixed Arbuscular mycorrhizal
                    fungi (AMF) into soil, prior to sowing, at 800 trial plots
                    on 54 maize farms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This fungi occurs naturally in healthy soil and penetrates
                    the roots of plants to form tree-like structures
                    (arbuscules). When they branch out, they increase the
                    plant's root surface area and therefore bolster nutrient
                    uptake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "On a quarter of the plots, the mycorrhizal fungi enabled up
                    to 40% better yields," said the study's co-lead, Marcel van
                    der Heijden, a soil ecologist at the University of Zurich
                    and at agricultural research center Asgroscope. "That's
                    huge."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Investigating why a third showed little increase or even a
                    decrease in yield, the researchers found that healthy soil
                    produced the same (or, in some instances, lower) yields.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We discovered that the inoculation functioned best when
                    there were lots of fungal pathogens already in the soil,"
                    said co-first author Stefanie Lutz from Agroscope.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fungi are thought to provide a first line of defense for
                    the soil, warding off plant-attacking pathogens that can
                    greatly reduce crop yields. As a result, yields could be
                    maintained in fields with pathogens that would have
                    experienced losses without the fungi, while the beneficial
                    effect of the fungi on yields was lower in fields without
                    pathogen contamination. As beneficial organisms, they also
                    help the plants take on nutrients from the soil.

                better than to fill out a Microsoft LinkedIn profile was not
                done. The report also mistakes all transfers as benefiting the
                target institution, which is quite often not the situation. For
                example, over 12,000 Microsoft employees now currently work
                inside the advertising and data giant Google. IBM seems it might
                be doing the most careful vetting of potential employees.

                    Jen-Hsun Huang doubts that the U.S. could live without chips
                    from elsewhere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, believes it might take the U.S.
                    up to two decades to become self-reliant in chip
                    manufacturing. This statement comes from the head of the
                    company that has historically relied on chip production in
                    Taiwan, and significant efforts by the U.S. and Europe to
                    localize the crucial industry. However, the chip industry is
                    clearly expanding in America at a rate unseen in decades, so
                    he might be too skeptical.Â

                  <p>
                    "We are somewhere between a decade and two decades away from
                    supply chain independence," said Jensen Huang, speaking at
                    the New York Times's DealBook conference in New York,

                  <p>
                    [...] Huang noted thatÂ Nvidia'sÂ products rely
                    onÂ plentyÂ ofÂ components that come from different parts of
                    the world, and he does not see all of them produced in the
                    U.S. any time soon. Therefore, his assessments highlight the
                    company's current reliance on international supply chains
                    and the complexity and extent of the global chip industry.Â

                    A report from Canalys forecasts that the nearly
                    two-year-long decline in PC shipments will finally end in Q4
                    of this year, flipping to a projected 5% growth. More growth
                    is also projected to arrive next year, which will supposedly
                    see 8% higher PC shipments than in 2023. Canalys expects the
                    surging interest in AI and the arrival of ARM-equipped PCs
                    to fuel this growth.

                    [...] A key assumption of this forecast is that new AI
                    software and hardware will re-spark consumer interest in
                    PCs. Canalys predicts that AI-powered PCs will account for
                    19% of all PCs shipped in 2024, a figure that includes

                    PCs with ARM chips are also expected to play an important
                    role in the recovery of the PC market. Although Apple's M
                    CPUs use the ARM architecture, Canalys pointed out
                    Qualcomm's

                    as the primary driver of growth for ARM-based PCs. The firm
                    previously predicted ARM chips would grab

                    Of course, the health of the global economy is perhaps the
                    biggest factor in whether consumers buy PCs. The decline of
                    shipments in 2022 and 2023 was precipitated largely on
                    potential buyers being more frugal with their money. The
                    report only touches on this and merely mentions there is "an
                    improving macroeconomic environment." Assuming this recovery
                    of the economy persists into 2024, then it could carry the
                    PC market along.

                    NASA is addressing an issue with a Hubble Space Telescope
                    gyroscope that prompted the observatory to enter safe mode
                    on November 23. Science operations have been suspended as a

                    [...] The team at NASA is currently running tests to better

                    gyroscopes during Hubbleâs fifth and final space shuttle
                    servicing mission in 2009. Out of these, three remain
                    operational, including the one currently exhibiting
                    fluctuations. While Hubble operates most efficiently using
                    three gyroscopes, it can continue its scientific
                    observations with only one if required.

                  <p>
                    NASA anticipates that the telescope will not only recover
                    from this setback but also continue to work in tandem with
                    other observatories, such as the James Webb Space Telescope.
                    This collaboration is expected to extend throughout this
                    decade and possibly into the next, ensuring Hubbleâs ongoing
                    contribution to our understanding of the cosmos.

                    The tech giant is going to be getting rid of them, starting
                    from Friday, under its inactive account policy.

                    The company said it would take a phased approach, starting
                    with accounts that "were created and never used again".

                    Simply signing into an account or sending an email should be

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google said the change was because of security reasons,
                    highlighting that forgotten and unused accounts are more
                    likely to be compromised.

                    vulnerable is because they tend to rely on old or re-used
                    passwords and largely have not had two-factor authentication

                <div>
                  <p>
                    That's around six million times more than is used in a
                    typical credit card swipe, Alex de Vries of Vrije
                    Universiteit Amsterdam, calculates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The figure is due to the water used to power and cool the
                    millions of computers worldwide Bitcoin relies on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It comes as many regions struggle with fresh water
                    shortages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In total, bitcoin consumed nearly 1,600 billion litres
                    - also known as gigalitres (GL) - of water in 2021, the
                    study, published in the journal Cell Reports Sustainability,
                    suggests.
                  </p>
                  <p>It says the 2023 figure could be more than 2,200 GL.</p>
                  <p>
                    The main reason Bitcoin uses so much water is because it
                    relies on an enormous amount of computing power, which in
                    turn needs huge amounts of electricity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mr de Vries argues that Bitcoin does not need to use
                    this much water - singling out the power hungry process at
                    its heart, which is known as "Bitcoin mining."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This method is known as "proof of work". But a change
                    to the way Bitcoin works could cut the electricity use and
                    hence water consumption dramatically.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The major cryptocurrency Ethereum did this in Sep 2022,
                    moving to a system called "proof of stake", reducing its
                    power-use by more than 99% in the process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That may not be straightforward though, according to Prof
                    James Davenport, of the University of Bath.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "[It was] only possible because the management of Ethereum
                    is significantly more centralised than that of Bitcoin," he
                    told the BBC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nonetheless, others say the findings of this research are
                    worrying.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr Larisa Yarovaya, associate professor of finance at the
                    University of Southampton, she said the use of freshwater
                    for Bitcoin mining, particularly in regions already
                    grappling with water scarcity, "should be a cause for
                    concern among regulators and the public".

                    Whilst parents have always felt some responsibility for
                    their children's development, the heightened intensity of
                    parenting in recent years now means parents are expected to
                    spend more time exhaustively watching, noticing and
                    responding to their children's desires and behaviours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This, the research suggests, is leaving less time for
                    children to play independently where they learn for
                    themselves the risks and dangers of outdoor play.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Until around the 1990s, parents were not expected to
                    endlessly entertain and monitor their children in the same
                    way they are today, so children had greater freedom to play
                    independently," explained the study's author Dr John Day.
                    "But since those children have become parents themselves,
                    society has changed so there is a heightened feeling of
                    responsibility for their children's development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "One aspect of the problem is increased fears around
                    stranger danger and more traffic on the roads which means
                    opportunities for children to be physically active through
                    spontaneous play have become limited."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, today's youngsters are spending less time playing
                    together away from adult care and more time under parental
                    supervision and participating in structured health-focused
                    physical activity settings such as holiday clubs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Growing concerns around child health meant many
                    parents born after the late 1960s, who started parenting in
                    the early 1990s, felt as though they should intervene to
                    make sure their children were active, which restricted the
                    possibility for more spontaneous forms of play.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Society today positions parents as the sole engineers in
                    their children's development which represents an unrealistic
                    burden that brings with it unjust pressure and expectation,"
                    added Dr Day.To help address this trend, Dr Day says there
                    needs to be a culture shift where health policy makers
                    ensure children are encouraged to learn about the risks of
                    physically active play, independent of adult
                    supervision."Parenting is no longer simply an aspect of who
                    someone is but a role one is expected to extensively
                    perform. Parents and their children are trapped together in
                    this scenario and so we need policymakers to recognise this
                    and work with parents and children to change this for future
                    generations," he said.

                  <p>
                    The core idea in all three is that Amazon has become the
                    default place to shop online for many. So, when Amazon
                    changes their site in ways that make Amazon higher profits
                    but hurt consumers, it takes work for people to figure that
                    out and shop elsewhere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The papers criticize the common assumption that people will
                    quickly switch to shopping elsewhere if the Amazon customer
                    experience deteriorates. Realistically, people are busy.
                    People have imperfect information, limited time, and it is
                    effortful to find another place to shop. At least up to some
                    limit, people may tolerate a familiar but substantially
                    deteroriated experience for some time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I think one model of customer attrition is that every
                    time customers notice a bad experience, they have some
                    probability of using Amazon less in the future. The more bad
                    experiences they have, the faster the damage to long-term
                    revenue. Under this model, even the level of ads Amazon has
                    now is causing slow damage to Amazon. Amazon execs may not
                    notice because the damage is over long periods of time and
                    hard to attribute directly back to the poor quality search
                    results, but the damage is there. This is the model I've
                    seen used by some others, such as Google Research in their
                    "Focus on the Long-term" paper.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another model might be that consumers are captured by
                    dominant companies such as Amazon and will not pay the costs
                    to switch until they hit some threshold. That is, most
                    customers will refuse to try alternatives until it is
                    completely obvious that it is worth the effort. This assumes
                    that Amazon can exploit customers for a very long time, and
                    that customers will not stop using Amazon no matter what
                    they do. There is some extreme where that breaks, but only
                    at the threshold, not before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The difference between these two models matters a lot. If
                    Amazon is experiencing substantial but slow costs from what
                    they are doing right now, there's much more hope for them
                    changing their behavior on their own than if Amazon is
                    experiencing no costs from their bad behavior unless
                    regulators impose costs externally. The solutions you get in
                    the two scenarios are likely to be different.

                    The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is getting
                    tough on website design, insisting that opting out of

                    Users will still see adverts regardless of their selection,

                    intended.

                  <p>
                    A few months on, the ICO has upped the ante. It has now
                    given 30 days' notice to companies running many of the UK's
                    most visited sites that they must comply with data
                    protection regulations or face enforcement action.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The ICO calls out cookie consent banners as a clear
                    example of often harmful design. Its guidance says: "A
                    website's cookie banner should make it as easy to reject
                    non-essential cookies as it is to accept them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Users should be able to make an informed choice on whether
                    they want to give consent for their personal information to
                    be used, for example, to profile them for targeted
                    advertising."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Cookie consent remains a hot topic for UK and EU
                    lawmakers alike. The EU, for example, has a relatively clear
                    stance on cookie consent â users should be offered a clear
                    and unambiguous choice: yes or no. The ICO requires a
                    similar approach.
                  </p>

                    Stable Video Diffusion, a new free AI research tool that can
                    turn any still image into a short videoâwith mixed results.
                    It's an open-weights preview of two AI models that use a
                    technique called image-to-video, and it can run locally on a
                    machine with an Nvidia GPU.

                      >Stable Diffusion</a
                    >, an "open weights" image synthesis model that kick started
                    a wave of open image synthesis and inspired a large
                    community of hobbyists that have built off the technology
                    with their own custom fine-tunings. Now Stability wants to
                    do the same with AI video synthesis, although the tech is
                    still in its infancy.<br />[...]<br />In our local testing,
                    a 14-frame generation took about 30 minutes to create on an
                    Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics card, but users can experiment with
                    running the models much faster on the cloud through services

                    (some of which you may need to pay for). In our experiments,
                    the generated animation typically keeps a portion of the
                    scene static and adds panning and zooming effects or
                    animates smoke or fire. People depicted in photos often do

                    Inching forward bumper to bumper on a highway when you're on
                    the way to an appointment, or worse, the airport, is enough
                    to spike anyone's blood pressure (BP). But researchers have
                    found that a BP surge occurs independent of external
                    stressors, and it could be due to the poor air flowing into
                    the car from surrounding traffic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The University of Washington (UW) researchers undertook a
                    randomized crossover trial and were surprised to see that
                    sitting in traffic and breathing unfiltered air was linked
                    to a 4.5 mm Hg surge in blood pressure, which peaked at
                    around 60 minutes of exposure but lingered for up to 24
                    hours following the event.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The body has a complex set of systems to try to keep blood
                    pressure to your brain the same all the time," said lead
                    researcher Joel Kaufman, a physician and professor at UW.
                    "It's a very complex, tightly regulated system, and it
                    appears that somewhere, in one of those mechanisms,
                    traffic-related air pollution interferes with blood
                    pressure."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the study, 16 participants aged 22-45 years were driven
                    as passengers through peak-hour traffic in Seattle for
                    periods across three days, to measure the impact of traffic
                    pollution on blood pressure. For two days, the air flowed
                    into the vehicle normally, to mirror how most of us drive,
                    and on another day the car was fitted with a high efficiency
                    particulate air (HEPA) filter, which blocked 86% of
                    particulate pollution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Blood pressure readings were taken a day before, during and
                    after the drive, with 14 three-minute tests collected.
                    Image-based central retinal arteriolar equivalents (CRAEs)
                    were also measured before and after. Brachial artery
                    diameter and gene expression were also taken.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The mean adjusted systolic blood pressure reading of 4.5 mm
                    Hg higher than baseline is comparable to the effect of a
                    high-sodium diet.

                    The summertime barbecue â an American tradition synonymous
                    with celebrating freedom â may be tainted by a decidedly
                    unfree market. A new Stanford study reveals how meat and
                    dairy industry lobbying has influenced government
                    regulations and funding to stifle competition from
                    alternative meat products with smaller climate and
                    environmental impacts. The analysis, published Aug. 18 in
                    One Earth, compares innovations and policies related to
                    plant-based meat alternatives and lab-grown meat in the U.S.
                    and European Union. Its findings could help ensure
                    legislation, such as the $428 billion U.S. Farm Bill set to
                    expire Sept. 30, levels the food industry playing field.

                    "The lack of policies focused on reducing our reliance on
                    animal-derived products and the lack of sufficient support
                    to alternative technologies to make them competitive are
                    symptomatic of a system still resisting fundamental
                    changes," said study lead author Simona Vallone, an Earth

                    [...] The researchers reviewed major agricultural policies
                    from 2014 to 2020 that supported either the animal food
                    product system or alternative technologies, and compared
                    government spending on both systems. They also looked at
                    related lobbying trends.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found that governments consistently devoted most of
                    their agricultural funding to livestock and feed production
                    systems, avoided highlighting food production sustainability
                    dimensions in nutrition guidelines, and attempted to
                    introduce regulatory hurdles, such as narrow labeling
                    standards, to the commercialization of meat alternatives.
                    Major U.S. meat and dairy companies actively lobbied against
                    environmental issues and regulations to tip the scales in
                    their favor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To ensure a fair marketplace for alternative meat
                    products, policymakers should craft legislation that ensures
                    meat's price reflects its environmental costs, increases
                    research on alternative meat and dairy products, and informs
                    consumers on alternatives to meat via dietary guidelines,
                    according to the researchers.

                A new study shows that there is greater local variation in the
                impact of solar storms on Earth than previously estimated.
                Researchers show that the effects can vary widely even over
                distances as small as 100 kilometers. The findings are published
                in Scientific Reports.
              </p>
              <p>
                Local changes in the magnetic environment have so far remained
                largely unexplored due to the sparse magnetometer array in the
                main observing area. Today, solar storms, or geomagnetic storms,
                are recorded on average by magnetometers spaced about 400 km
                apart.
              </p>
              <p>
                Solar storm effects are caused by fast solar wind streams, which
                cause large electric currents to flow through the ionosphere of
                the Earth's auroral region, but the behavior of these currents
                during storms is still not fully understood. Solar storms also
                appear as auroras.

                Researchers from the SodankylÃ¤ Geophysical Observatory (SGO) and
                the Ionospheric Physics Group at the University of Oulu, Finland
                studied the local magnetic field perturbations in the auroral
                region during space storms using historical data.

              <p>
                The new study looked at data from a strong solar storm in
                December 1977 from all 32 stations of the then Scandinavian
                Magnetometer Array (SMA) network in the Nordic countries, which
                is denser than the current network, and largely unexplored.

                    Since antiquity, humans have envisioned various means of
                    time travel into the future or the past. The concept has
                    since become a staple of modern science fiction. In
                    particular, the number of films that make use of time travel
                    has increased significantly over the decades, while the
                    real-world science has evolved right alongside them, moving
                    from simple Newtonian mechanics and general relativity to
                    quantum mechanics and the notion of a multiverse or more
                    exotic alternatives like string theory.<br />[...]<br />This
                    is not meant to be an exhaustive list; rather, we selected
                    films that represented many diverse approaches to time
                    travel across multiple subgenres and decades. We then
                    evaluated each oneâgrading on a curveâwith regard to its
                    overall entertainment value and scientific logic, with the
                    final combined score determining a film's spot on the
                    overall ranking. For the "science" part of our scoring
                    system, we specifically took three factors into account.
                    First and foremost, does the time travel make logical sense?
                    Second, is the physical mechanism of time travel somewhat
                    realistic? And third, does the film use time travel in
                    narratively interesting ways? So a movie like Looper, which
                    makes absolutely no sense if you think about it too hard,
                    gets points for weaving time paradoxes thoroughly into the
                    fabric of the story.

                    TSMC chairman Mark Liu believes Nvidia will become the
                    largest semiconductor firm by the end of the year (via
                    <a
                      href="https://www.trendforce.com/news/2023/11/27/news-tsmc-chairman-notes-global-fragmentation-with-the-rise-of-nvidia-and-fabless-companies/"
                      >Trendforce</a
                    >). Speaking at a lecture held by the Chinese National
                    Association of Industry and Commerce, Liu discussed the
                    future of TSMC in an AI-focused world and stated that Nvidia
                    would develop into the world's largest semiconductor company
                    thanks to AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As for Nvidia's rivals, the company made more revenue
                    than
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-takes-chip-business-revenue-crown-from-tsmc"
                      >Intel, Samsung, and even TSMC</a
                    >, the company that produces the vast majority of Nvidia's
                    chips. Nvidia also beat them all in profit, especially
                    Intel, which lost $8 million, and Samsung, which saw $2.86
                    billion wiped out due to factors like the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/potential-nand-shortage-could-mean-end-of-dirt-cheap-ssds"
                      >NAND flash crisis</a
                    >. That's presumably why Liu believes Nvidia will be the
                    largest of its peers by the end of the year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, there are some caveats to Liu's claims. Although
                    Nvidia did beat out its immediate rivals and made the most
                    money in Q3, that might only have been possible since Intel,
                    Samsung, and TSMC are in a slump. All three companies were
                    doing significantly better in revenue before the start of
                    the year, and they all have posted at least one quarter with
                    more than $20 billion in revenue since 2021. If this turns
                    out to be a temporary dip rather than a permanent
                    development, Nvidia would need to make even more money to
                    keep up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Liu also noted that fabless chip designers like
                    Nvidia, AMD, and Google are expected to grow by 10% in the
                    next five years, while projections for Intel and Samsung
                    (the only chip designers to own their fabs) are at just 4%
                    in the same time frame. Both companies have declined for a
                    year or so, with Intel taking great measures to
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intel-ceo-details-company-s-three-biggest-mistakes"
                      >reform its business</a
                    >. TSMC, of course, stands as a major beneficiary if these
                    projections prove accurate, as most fabless companies who
                    want to make cutting-edge processors go to TSMC.

                    After 151 years, Popular Science will no longer be available
                    to purchase as a magazine. In a statement to The Verge,
                    Cathy Hebert, the communications director for PopSci owner
                    Recurrent Ventures, says the outlet needs to "evolve" beyond
                    its magazine product, which published its first all-digital
                    issue in 2021.

                    PopSci, which covers a whole range of stories related to the
                    fields of science, technology, and nature, published its
                    first issue in 1872. Things have changed a lot over the
                    years, with the magazine switching to a quarterly
                    publication schedule in 2018 and doing away with the
                    physical copies altogether after 2020.

                    kind of biometric authentication device installed. Sometimes
                    that means a face- or iris-scanning infrared webcam;
                    sometimes it means a fingerprint sensor mounted on the power
                    button or elsewhere on the device.

                    While these authentication methods are convenient, they
                    aren't totally immune to security exploits. In 2021,
                    researchers were able to fool some Windows Hello IR webcams
                    with infrared images of users' faces. And last week,
                    researchers at Blackwing Intelligence

                    The CEO of Australian telco Optus, Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, has
                    resigned after deciding it was in the best interests of her
                    former employer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bayer Rosmarin's resignation follows a

                    >
                    that saw around ten million Australians unable to connect to
                    any Optus services for fourteen hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Optus hid its explanation of the outage in an FAQ at the
                    bottom of
                    <a href="https://www.optus.com.au/notices/outage-response"
                      >this page</a
                    >, where the incident is described as follows:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At around 4.05am Wednesday morning, the Optus network
                    received changes to routing information from an
                    international peering network following a software upgrade.
                    These routing information changes propagated through
                    multiple layers in our network and exceeded preset safety
                    levels on key routers. This resulted in those routers
                    disconnecting from the Optus IP Core network to protect
                    themselves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was later revealed that the source of the routing
                    information was Singtel, the Singapore-based telco that owns
                    Optus. The Optus network connects to Singtel internet
                    exchanges in North America and Asia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Optus later blamed the incident on default settings in its
                    Cisco routers, which couldn't cope with the volume of
                    changes sent by Singtel as they exceeded safety limits.
                    Optus's submission explaining the outage is, however, silent
                    on or why its network accepted such changes without testing
                    their impact on its kit â a common and sensible approach to
                    operating mission-critical infrastructure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The danger Optus's outage posed, and the mass
                    inconvenience, earned Bayer Rosmarin an appearance before a
                    parliamentary committee.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Yet Bayer Rosmarin did not do well in her appearance
                    regarding the outage, revealing that the nation's
                    second-largest telco's disaster recovery regime did not
                    envisage a total network outage. Another admission was that
                    the former CEO's personal DR strategy had evolved to see her
                    carry SIM cards for Australia's two rival mobile networks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Left unanswered is how Singtel poisoned the network in
                    the first place, amid an undercurrent of concern that a
                    foreign carrier â even one from a friend like Singapore â
                    had deep enough access to an Australian network to bring it
                    down.

                    Patients often come into clinics on a grocery list of
                    medications. Common prescriptions include lisinopril 20 mg,
                    amlodipine 2.5 mg, metformin 500 mg, and aspirin 81 mg. One
                    dosage stands out from the others. While most medications
                    come in dosages of round numbers or common decimals,
                    low-dose aspirin has a standard dose of 81 mg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Why is aspirin available at a dose of 81 milligrams? The
                    answer is historical in nature and is rooted in a medieval
                    and now defunct system of measurement called the apothecary
                    system of weights and measures. The full explanation of
                    aspirin 81 requires some background information on the
                    apothecary system and is best explained in comparison to the
                    more familiar metric system.

                    Burning coal to generate electricity is on the way out in
                    the United States, but the nation's long dependence on the
                    fossil fuel took a devastating toll.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A new study determined for the first time that soot
                    pollution from coal-fired power plants is more dangerous
                    than soot from other sources. During the past two decades,
                    the researchers found, coal plant soot contributed to the
                    deaths of at least 460,000 Americans, including 25% of all
                    deaths among Medicare recipients before 2009.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Only Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio recorded more deaths
                    associated with coal plant pollution than the 25,000 deaths
                    in Illinois during the period studied.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An interactive map accompanying the study, published in the
                    journal Science, reveals glimmers of hope amid the grim
                    statistics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Deaths attributed to coal plant soot have declined
                    dramatically in recent years as utilities closed scores of

                    "The fact that they estimated more than 40,000 deaths a year
                    two decades ago and the number is now down to 1,600 a year
                    is a pretty remarkable success story," said Jonathan Levy,
                    chair of the Department of Environmental Health at Boston
                    University, who wasn't involved in the study.

                    Soot, also known as particulate matter, is a byproduct of
                    incomplete combustion and can be formed by chemical
                    reactions between sulfur dioxide emitted by fossil fuel
                    power plants and other compounds in the atmosphere. The type
                    of soot that most concerns public health
                    researchersâPM2.5âis so tiny that thousands of the fine
                    particles could fit on the period at the end of this
                    sentence.

                    Breathing even small amounts can inflame the lungs and
                    trigger asthma attacks. Previous studies have linked soot
                    exposure with heart attacks and premature death.

                    Instead of a handy "alternate route," Google Maps was
                    leading her and her two passengers "far off the major
                    highway and into Nevada's fierce deserts on an off-roading
                    trail." Easler's car were not the only bushwackers. In

                    driver that turned around talked to us to tell us that the
                    road gets washed out the higher into the mountain you get,
                    and we have to turn around since the path leads nowhere. He
                    was in a huge truck and was just driving straight through
                    the bushes and shrubs to let people know to turn around,"
                    Easler said.

                  <p>
                    The off-roading trail was apparently only wide enough for
                    traffic in one direction, and attempting to return in that
                    other direction, "We were driving over bushes and rocks and
                    alot of the cars couldn't even make it," Easler says in the
                    second video. "Which is kind of why our car broke down."

                    They told SFGate that ultimately "We had to leave the car in
                    Vegas, and it got towed to the service center of a
                    dealership. They said the rear, right tire was coming off,
                    and the alignment was messed up too. Low-key a pretty
                    expensive fix."

                    They eventually called the highway patrol to shut down the
                    road that Google Maps was sending people to, because "With
                    every car coming in, every single car was getting trapped."

                    An estimated 50,000 shipwrecks can be found around the UK's
                    coastline and have been acting as a hidden refuge for fish,
                    corals and other marine species in areas still open to
                    destructive bottom towed fishing, a new study has shown.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of these wrecks have been lying on the seabed for well
                    over a century, and have served as a deterrent to fishers
                    who use bottom towed trawling to secure their catches.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result, while many areas of the seabed have been
                    damaged significantly in areas of heavy fishing pressure,
                    the seabed in and around shipwrecks remains largely
                    unblemished.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Jenny Hickman, the study's lead author, completed the
                    research as part of her MSc Marine Conservation program at
                    the University of Plymouth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She said, "The industrial use of bottom towed fishing gear
                    has been commonplace since the 1800s, and has significantly
                    altered marine communities and ecosystem services. Outside
                    of legal protection, only areas inaccessible to trawlers are
                    offered any protection, which is why shipwreck sites are
                    rarely subject to trawling pressure. As many have been in
                    situ for more than 100 years, they offer a baseline of
                    ecological potential when trawling pressure is reduced or
                    removed."
                  </p>

                    [...] Joe Richards, Scotland Project Manager for Blue Marine
                    Foundation and one of the study's co-authors, said, "It has
                    long been thought that shipwrecks could be playing an
                    important role in providing sanctuary for marine species to
                    utilize. It is brilliant to see this proven in this study.
                    The research provides and insight into what might be
                    possible if bottom towed fishing activity is reduced. This
                    feeds into our wider understanding of shipwrecks' potential
                    to contribute to ecosystem recovery and enhancement, given
                    the sheer number found on the seabed."

                    Scott's ruling is considered a big blow to Tesla, which had
                    denied liability for Banner's death, arguing that human
                    error is at fault because "its manual and the 'clickwrap'
                    agreement sufficiently warned" Tesla owners of Autopilot's
                    limitations.

                    [...] Despite being called the "de facto leader" of the
                    Autopilot team in internal Tesla emails, Musk did not
                    provide a deposition in Banner's case, which was one of the
                    first times Tesla had to defend itself against claims that
                    Autopilot was fatally flawed,

                      >Reuters reported</a
                    >. In August, Tesla also seemingly attempted to do damage
                    control by seeking to "keep deposition transcripts of its
                    employees and other documents secret," Reuters noted.

                    [...] According to an expert in autonomous systems in
                    vehicles and driver monitoring systems who testified as one
                    of Banner's witnesses, Mary "Missy" Cummings, Tesla's
                    Autopilot is substandard in many ways. Cumming's opinion was
                    that Tesla overrepresented the Autopilot technology "as far
                    more capable than it actually was" and "used insufficient
                    avoidance detection technology." Cummings also suggested
                    that "the steering wheel torque driver inattention
                    attenuation technology was substandard to driver facing
                    cameras used by other auto manufacturers." In addition to
                    other flaws, these allegedly major defects, Cummings said,
                    "led to the foreseeability of the resulting crash in this
                    case," Scott wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scott based part of his opinion specifically on Cummings'
                    testimony and testimony from Adam Gustafsson, the systems
                    engineer who investigated both Banner's and Brown's Tesla
                    crashes, concluding that, "There is reasonable evidence from
                    which the finder of fact could conclude that Tesla through
                    its officers, employees and agents knew the vehicle at issue
                    had a defective Autopilot system and allowed the vehicle
                    with the system to be driven in areas not safe for that
                    technology."

                    as on Adobe's raster editing tool, Photoshop. Moreover,
                    absent the transaction, Figma is significantly likely to

                    One summer morning, Le Thi Hong Mai's home collapsed into a
                    river in Vietnam's Mekong Delta, where shoreline erosion
                    caused by sand mining and hydropower dams threatens hundreds
                    of thousands of people.

                  <p>
                    Sandâneeded to produce concreteâis the world's second most
                    exploited natural resource after water, and its use has
                    tripled in the last two decades, according to the UN
                    environment program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Vietnam's "rice bowl" delta region, where the Mekong empties
                    into the South China Sea, is predicted to run out of sand in
                    just over a decade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But losses to the riverbed are already devastating lives and
                    harming the local economy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Over the past two decades, hydropower dams upstream on
                    the Mekong have restricted the flow of sand to the delta.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And sand mining to feed Vietnam's construction boom is also
                    fast depleting resources, according to a major WWF report
                    published earlier this year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to Vietnam's ministry of transport, the
                    Delta region needs 54 million cubic meters of sand for six
                    major national highways before 2025.

                  <p>
                    The river system can provide less than half, the ministry
                    says.

                    But given high domestic demand, the amount dredged still
                    exceeds what comes downstream, Mekong expert Nguyen Huu

                    At the current extraction rate of 35-55 million cubic meters

                    WWF-led study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These are the last grains of sand we are dredging," Thien
                    warned.

                  <p>
                    "After that, the delta will disappear altogether and we will
                    have to redraw our map and rewrite our geography books."

                    Because it's going to Mars, ESCAPADE has a relatively narrow
                    window to get off the ground next year. Documents on the
                    mission presented at public meetings earlier this year
                    indicated it had a launch window in August 2024, but Smith
                    said Monday that the mission is now set to fly "around this
                    time next year."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But there's not just the risk of a failed launch.
                    Given Blue Origin's history of delays, it's fair to question
                    whether New Glenn will really be ready to fly in a year's
                    time. The company's launch pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force
                    Station in Florida is complete, and production of rocket
                    parts is underway at Blue Origin factory a few miles away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Blue Origin hasn't rolled a full-scale New Glenn rocket
                    out to the launch pad for testing, including propellant
                    loading and countdown rehearsals. These first-time launch
                    pad tests have run for several months to more than a year
                    for other rockets, such as SpaceX's Starship, ULA's Vulcan,
                    or Europe's Ariane 6.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There's certainly some schedule risk associated with New
                    Glenn getting to the pad a year from now," Smith said.
                    "They're building hardware ... I've seen their schedule. I'm
                    not going to put a percentage out there."

                    filed by Moniruzzamanâs old employer, automotive technology
                    company Valeo, which is suing Nvidia â the company
                    Moniruzzaman moved on to â and accusing it of having
                    benefited from these stolen trade secrets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nvidia has spent the better part of a decade attempting to
                    branch out into the automotive market. Valeo is alleging
                    that Moniruzzaman âdownloaded without authorization the
                    entirety of Valeoâs advanced parking and driving assistance
                    systems source codeâ in early 2021, along with âscores of
                    Valeo Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, PDF files,
                    and Excel spreadsheets explaining various aspects of the
                    technologyâ before leaving to join Nvidia in August that
                    year.Â 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This alleged theft came to light in March the following
                    year, when employees from both Nvidia and Valeo were on a
                    call together working on a joint parking assistance project
                    for an unnamed automotive parts maker. Nvidia had won the
                    contract to develop software on the project, while Valeo was
                    providing ultrasonic sensor hardware. The lawsuit claims:Â 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    âOn March 8, 2022, one of these videoconference meetings was
                    scheduled. Mr. Moniruzzaman, now employed by Nvidia,
                    attended the videoconference callâ¦ and shared his computer
                    screen during the call. When he minimized the PowerPoint
                    presentation he had been sharing, however, he revealed one
                    of Valeoâs verbatim source code files open on his computer.
                    So brazen was Mr. Moniruzzamanâs theft, the file path on his
                    screen still read âValeoDocs.â Valeo participants on the
                    videoconference call immediately recognized the source code
                    and took a screenshot before Mr. Moniruzzaman was alerted of
                    his error. By then it was too late to cover his tracks.â
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit goes on to state that German police âdiscovered
                    Valeo documentation and hardware pinned on the walls of Mr.
                    Moniruzzamanâs home officeâ when they raided his home as
                    part of a criminal investigation, and that Valeoâs software
                    and documents were found on his Nvidia computer when it was
                    seized by investigators. Moniruzzaman admitted to stealing
                    Valeoâs software when questioned by German police, according
                    to the lawsuit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As a result, Valeo is seeking damages and an
                    injunction to stop Nvidia and its employees from using or
                    sharing its trade secrets.

                    Given vast computing resources, the new model was able to
                    solve certain mathematical problems, the person said on
                    condition of anonymity because the individual was not
                    authorized to speak on behalf of the company. Though only
                    performing math on the level of grade-school students, acing
                    such tests made researchers very optimistic about Q*âs
                    future success, the source said.

                  <p>
                    Once math is conquered, AI will have greater reasoning
                    capabilities resembling human intelligence. After that, AI
                    could work on novel scientific research.

                    The letter flagged the potential danger of Q-Star, although
                    itâs unclear what the safety concerns are. Generally
                    speaking, researchers worry that the dawn of AI might also
                    lead to the demise of the human species.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As more intelligent AI comes along, it might decide that
                    destroying the human species might better serve its
                    interests. It sounds like the premise of
                    <em>Terminator</em> and <em>Matrix</em>, but itâs one fear
                    AI researchers have.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Itâs unclear whether Q-Star is the key development that
                    could lead there. But weâll only know after the fact.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers have also flagged work by an âAI scientistâ
                    team, the existence of which multiple sources confirmed. The
                    group, formed by combining earlier âCode Genâ and âMath Genâ
                    teams, was exploring how to optimize existing AI models to
                    improve their reasoning and eventually perform scientific
                    work, one of the people said.

                    While OpenAI is yet to confirm this rumored innovation, Sam
                    Altman did tease a big breakthrough in the days preceding
                    his ouster.

                    NASA has celebrated a shipment of half a kilo of plutonium
                    oxide by the US Department of Energy, the largest since US
                    production of plutonium-238 was restarted just over a decade
                    ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Plutonium-238 (Pu-238) is essential for NASA missions using
                    Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS). RPS makes use of the
                    natural decay of Pu-238 to provide heat and electricity
                    through systems such as the Multi-Mission Radioisotope
                    Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG). As such, it's essential
                    for missions where solar power is not an option.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA's recent Mars rovers use the fuel, and Perseverance
                    uses an MMRTG to provide the robot with continuous heat and
                    approximately 110 watts of electricity. Other missions, such
                    as Cassini, also used the isotope, and Pu-238 power has kept
                    the Voyager probes running decades after the launch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, supplies have been limited. Pu-238 is a byproduct
                    of the process used to make nuclear weapons. As the need for
                    new nuclear weapons has ebbed over the years, stockpiles of
                    the fuel have dwindled. In 2015,
                    <a

                    estimated that approximately 35 kg remained available to
                    NASA, and of that, only 17 kg was good enough to use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hence the need to restart production. In 2010, the US
                    Department of Energy submitted a

                    production rate of 1.5 kg per year by 2015. According to
                    NASA, that target won't be hit until at least 2026.

                    One chemical used in some anti-cancer drugs, for example,
                    costs pharmaceutical companies $3,200 per gramâ50 times more
                    than a gram of gold. The UCLA researchers devised an
                    inexpensive way to produce this drug molecule from a
                    chemical costing just $3 per gram. They were also able to
                    apply the process to produce many other chemicals used in
                    medicine and agriculture for a fraction of the usual cost.

                    Industrial production of amines is therefore of great
                    interest, but the raw materials and reagents are often
                    expensive, and the processes can require many complicated
                    steps to complete. Using fewer steps and no expensive
                    ingredients, the process developed at UCLA can produce
                    valuable chemicals at a much lower cost than current
                    methods.

                    world's first commercial supersonic airliner â with the
                    story to date of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and to
                    suggest a possible future for the latter. Concorde turned
                    out to be a technology too far, and I suggest that BEVs are
                    heading the same way."

                    [...] "Better technology will help, of course, but not
                    enough. In 1974, when I bought my first electronic
                    calculator, the AA battery had a carbon rod core and an
                    outer casing of zinc. Intensive research and development
                    since then has provided us with the lithium-ion battery,
                    which can store six times as much electrical energy in the
                    same volume. However, the energy density is still 40 times
                    worse than petrol. Experts suggest that the best we can hope
                    for is an improvement by a factor of two over the next 50
                    years.

                    None of these problems will be solved in the next few years,
                    and there is now evidence that many car manufacturers are
                    having second thoughts about involvement in the sector. The
                    most likely outcome is that BEVs will be a rerun of the
                    Concorde story, ending up as a short-lived plaything for the
                    wealthy few, and for a similar complex set of reasons."

                I think a mix of EV and ICE is best, both have strong and weak
                sides. It is stupid to develop a crash program for expensive
                technology as a solution to what many good scientists consider a
                non-problem.
