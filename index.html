                <div>
                  <p>
                    On Wednesday, federal prosecutors charged a North Carolina
                    musician with defrauding streaming services of $10 million
                    through an elaborate scheme involving AI, as
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/nc-man-charged-ai-fake-music.html"
                      >reported by</a
                    >
                    The New York Times. Michael Smith, 52, allegedly used AI to
                    create hundreds of thousands of fake songs by nonexistent
                    bands, then streamed them using bots to collect royalties
                    from platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the AI-generated element of this story is novel, Smith
                    allegedly broke the law by setting up an elaborate fake
                    listener scheme. The US Attorney for the Southern District
                    of New York, Damian Williams,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/north-carolina-musician-charged-music-streaming-fraud-aided-artificial-intelligence"
                      >announced the charges</a
                    >, which include wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy.
                    If convicted, Smith could face up to 20 years in prison for
                    each charge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To avoid detection, Smith spread his streaming activity
                    across numerous fake songs, never playing a single track too
                    many times. He also generated unique names for the
                    AI-created artists and songs, trying to blend in with the
                    quirky names of legitimate musical acts. Smith used artist
                    names like "Callous Post" and "Calorie Screams," while their
                    songs included titles such as "Zygotic Washstands" and
                    "Zymotechnical."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Initially, Smith uploaded his own original
                    compositions to streaming platforms but found that his small
                    catalog failed to generate significant income. In an attempt
                    to scale up, he briefly collaborated with other musicians,
                    reportedly offering to play their songs for royalties,
                    though these efforts failed. This led Smith to pivot to
                    AI-generated music in 2018 when he partnered with an
                    as-yet-unnamed AI music company CEO and a music promoter to
                    create a large library of computer-generated songs. The
                    district attorney
                    <a
                      href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/north-carolina-musician-charged-music-streaming-fraud-aided-artificial-intelligence"
                      >announcement</a
                    >
                    did not specify precisely what method Smith used to generate
                    the songs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When confronted by a music distribution company about
                    "multiple reports of streaming abuse" in 2018, The New York
                    Times says that Smith acted shocked and strongly denied any
                    wrongdoing, insisting there was "absolutely no fraud going
                    on whatsoever."

                  <p>
                    [....] Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther said on August 13 that
                    a "breakthrough" in the city's forensic investigation of the
                    breach found that the sensitive files Rhysida obtained were

                    making them "unusable" to the thieves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] Shortly after Ginther made his remarks, security
                    researcher David Leroy Ross contacted local news outlets and
                    presented evidence that showed the data Rhysida published
                    was fully intact and contained highly sensitive information
                    regarding city employees and residents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] On Thursday, the city of Columbus sued Ross for
                    alleged damages for criminal acts, invasion of privacy,
                    negligence, and civil conversion. The lawsuit claimed that
                    downloading documents from a dark web site run by ransomware
                    attackers amounted to him "interacting" with them and
                    required special expertise and tools. The suit went on to
                    challenge Ross alerting reporters to the information, which
                    it claimed would not be easily obtained by others.

                    data or disseminating it to reporters, but it has no effect
                    on those who plan to use the data for malicious purposes.

                    "Researchers have peered into the brains and bodies of
                    living animals after discovering that a common food dye can
                    make skin, muscle and connective tissues temporarily
                    transparent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Applying the dye to the belly of a mouse made its liver,
                    intestines and bladder clearly visible through the abdominal
                    skin, while smearing it on the rodent's scalp allowed
                    scientists to see blood vessels in the animal's brain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Treated skin regained its normal colour when the dye was
                    washed off, according to researchers at Stanford University,
                    who believe the procedure opens up a host of applications in
                    humans, from locating injuries and finding veins for drawing
                    blood to monitoring digestive disorders and spotting
                    tumours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Instead of relying on invasive biopsies, doctors might be
                    able to diagnose deep-seated tumours by simply examining a
                    person's tissue without the need for invasive surgical
                    removal," said Dr Guosong Hong, a senior researcher on the
                    project. "This technique could potentially make blood draws
                    less painful by helping phlebotomists easily locate veins
                    under the skin."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The most surprising part of this study is that we
                    usually expect dye molecules to make things less
                    transparent. For example, if you mix blue pen ink in water,
                    the more ink you add, the less light can pass through the
                    water," Hong said. "In our experiment, when we dissolve
                    tartrazine in an opaque material like muscle or skin, which
                    normally scatters light, the more tartrazine we add, the
                    clearer the material becomes. But only in the red part of
                    the light spectrum. This goes against what we typically
                    expect with dyes."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers describe the process as "reversible and
                    repeatable", with skin reverting to its natural colour once
                    the dye is washed away. At the moment, transparency is
                    limited to the depth the dye penetrates, but Hong said
                    microneedle patches or injections could deliver the dye more
                    deeply.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The procedure has not yet been tested on humans and
                    researchers will need to show it is safe to use,
                    particularly if the dye is injected beneath the skin.

                    Volkswagen AG is considering factory closures in Germany for
                    the first time in its 87-year history, parting with
                    tradition and risking a feud with unions in a step that
                    reflects the deep woes roiling Europe's auto industry.

                    After years of ignoring overcapacity and slumping
                    competitiveness, the German auto giant's moves are likely to
                    kick off a broader reckoning in the industry. The reasons
                    are clear: Europe's efforts to compete with Chinese rivals
                    and Tesla Inc. in electric cars are faltering. (full article

                    they called the network "STINKY." For another, they were
                    soon adding more gear around the ship, which was bound to
                    raise further questions. The chiefs found that the Wi-Fi
                    signal coming off the Starlink satellite transceiver
                    couldn't cover the entire ship, so during a stop in Pearl
                    Harbor, they bought "signal repeaters and cable" to extend
                    coverage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sailors on the ship then began finding the STINKY network
                    and asking questions about it.<br />[...]<br />Ship officers
                    heard the scuttlebutt about STINKY, of course, and they
                    began asking questions and doing inspections, but they never
                    found the concealed device. On August 18, though, a civilian
                    worker from the Naval Information Warfare Center was
                    installing an authorized
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starshield"

                    >
                    and came across the unauthorized SpaceX device hidden on the
                    weatherdeck.<br />[...]<br />All of the chiefs who used,
                    paid for, or even knew about the system without disclosing
                    it were given "administrative nonjudicial punishment at
                    commodore's mast," said Navy Times.

                    So there you go, kids: two object lessons in poor
                    decision-making. Whether working from an embassy bathroom or
                    the deck of a littoral combat ship, if you're a government
                    employee, think twice before giving in to the sweet

                    Well, here's a not-so-fun new twist in the
                    search-and-seizure narrative. Car owners are being deprived
                    of their vehicles just because cops think footage of a crime
                    may have been captured by the car's on-board cameras.

                    [....] But being in the wrong place at the wrong time might
                    mean drivers going without cars because cops have decided
                    the best way to secure this potential evidence is to take
                    cars away from their drivers. Here's Rachel Swan,

                        A Canadian tourist was visiting Oakland recently when he
                        had to talk someone out of taking his Tesla from a hotel
                        parking lot.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This was no thief. It was the Oakland Police Department.
                        Turns out, the Tesla may have witnessed a homicide.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In Oakland and beyond, police called to crime scenes are
                        increasingly looking for more than shell casings and
                        fingerprints. They're scanning for Teslas parked nearby,
                        hoping their unique outward-facing cameras captured key
                        evidence. And, the Chronicle has found, they're even
                        resorting to obtaining warrants to tow the cars to
                        ensure they don't lose the video.
                      </p>

                  <p>
                    [....] At least warrants appear to be involved at this
                    point, which means there's a paper trail documenting law
                    enforcement's seizure of the inanimate "witness."
                    Unfortunately, that's not going to mean much to car owners
                    who may walk out of their houses, businesses, or places of
                    worship to discover their vehicle missing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even though this is handled about as well as it can be at
                    this point in time, this kind of thing is only going to
                    become more common. And, inevitably, some cops are going to
                    decide they don't have time to get a warrant, much less make
                    a good faith effort to secure the recordings from the
                    vehicle's owner before initiating a seizure.

                    Rakić's proposal goes further, providing an alternative
                    resolution to the Fermi paradox that goes beyond the
                    solution that aliens are so intelligent and advanced
                    humanity cannot perceive them. But "that is just a fragment
                    of the solution that is being proposed in this paper," he

                    They don't have to take a new form to avoid human detection;
                    they may have always existed this way. They might exist all
                    around us, even if they don't surpass us in intelligence or
                    have very little intelligence at all.

                  <p>
                    [...] Rakić concludes, "The formulation of the Fermi paradox
                    is actually too narrow. The paradox is indeed why humans
                    have not perceived extraterrestrial life in a universe that
                    is enormous, but the question is much broader: What may
                    exist around humans that humans cannot perceive ('around'
                    meaning both terrestrial, extraterrestrial in our universe,
                    as well as extraterrestrial in other universes)? That is the
                    key question.

                  <p>
                    "The Fermi paradox is only an anthropocentric formulation of
                    one aspect of this question."

                <div>
                  <p>
                    [...] Astrobotic developed and built the Peregrine lander
                    under contract to NASA, which awarded the company a $108
                    million contract to deliver a suite of government-sponsored
                    science payloads to the lunar surface. Peregrine Mission One
                    was the first mission launched under the umbrella of NASA's
                    Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, which buys
                    transportation from commercial vendors for science payloads
                    heading to the Moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It turns out Astrobotic officials were aware of the risk of
                    a pressure control valve failing on the Peregrine
                    spacecraft. The lander had two of these valves, one
                    controlling the flow of helium into the fuel tank and
                    another into the oxidizer tank. During ground testing before
                    the mission, the pressure control valve on the fuel side
                    started leaking, so engineers swapped it out for a new one.
                    The similar valve on the oxidizer side, which failed in
                    space, showed no problems during ground tests, according to
                    Sharad Bhaskaran, Astrobotic's mission director for
                    Peregrine Mission One.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although the pressure control valve on the oxidizer side was
                    the same design, Astrobotic decided not to replace it
                    because doing so would have required disassembling large
                    portions of the Peregrine lander, further delaying the
                    mission's launch, which was already running several years
                    behind schedule.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tests of a spare pressure control valve that were conducted
                    following the Peregrine mission confirmed it could leak
                    after engineers subjected it to vibrations like those it
                    would experience during a rocket launch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Astrobotic's next lander, named Griffin, is larger and
                    more complex than Peregrine. It will use the redesigned
                    pressure control valves, and Astrobotic will install
                    pressure regulators and so-called latch valves in the helium
                    system on Griffin. These new components would control the
                    flow of helium into the propellant tanks in the event of a
                    similar pressure control valve failure on Astrobotic's next
                    mission, officials said Tuesday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We’ve got increased reliability now in the system to
                    mitigate against that single-point failure," Clarke said.

                    Scientists have just slashed the potential hiding spaces for
                    dark matter particles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The LUX-ZEPLIN, or LZ, experiment has searched for and ruled
                    out the existence of dark matter particles with a wide swath
                    of properties, researchers report August 26 at two
                    conferences. Dark matter is a substance whose influence can
                    be seen on the scale of galaxies and galaxy clusters, but
                    which has never been directly detected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    LZ searches for a hypothetical type of dark matter particle
                    called a weakly interacting massive particle, specifically
                    WIMPs with masses above 9 billion electron volts. (For
                    comparison, a proton has a mass of around 1 billion electron
                    volts). The LZ detector, filled with 10 metric tons of
                    liquid xenon,

                    The researchers characterize WIMPs by their cross section —
                    the probability that a particle will interact. The result
                    shrinks the maximum possible cross section to about a fifth
                    that allowed by previous results, LZ researchers report at

                    The study was performed with 280 days' worth of data. LZ's
                    final results will be based on 1,000 days of data, and it's
                    expected to further carve away at the dark matter's
                    possibilities — or find evidence of it.

                    After an initial euphoric rush to the cloud, administrators
                    are questioning the value and promise of the tech giant's
                    services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to a
                    <a href="https://www.civo.com/cost-of-cloud-report-2024"
                      >report</a
                    >
                    published by UK cloud outfit Civo, more than a third of
                    organizations surveyed reckoned that their move to the cloud
                    had failed to live up to promises of cost-effectiveness.
                    Over half reported a rise in their cloud bill.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although the survey, unsurprisingly, paints Civo in a
                    flattering light, some of its figures may make uncomfortable
                    reading for customers sold on the promises from
                    hyperscalers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the IT world, there is an expectation that bang for
                    buck increases as time goes by, but in this example, prices
                    are rising faster than the
                    <a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/"
                      >rate of inflation</a
                    >, and what customers receive for their money remains
                    unchanged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The giddy enthusiasm might have waned in favor of some
                    hard-nosed ROI calculations, and some workloads might jump
                    away from cloud vendors, "but this will not constitute a
                    change in direction – just a ripple in the stream of dollars
                    flowing to the cloud."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, are prices increasing? The answer has to be yes. How
                    much of those rises are down to the major vendors
                    opportunistically adding of a few percentage points versus
                    an increase in fixed costs, such as electricity, is pretty
                    much irrelevant. The advice remains the same: the cloud is
                    here to stay although its luster has dulled over time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Time, then, to wheel out the ROI calculator and ensure
                    there's been no stealthy vendor lock-in. All clouds and all

                    In a pitch deck to prospective customers, one of Facebook's
                    alleged marketing partners explained how it listens to
                    users' smartphone microphones and advertises to them

                    that its so-called "Active Listening" software uses
                    artificial intelligence (AI) to "capture real-time intent
                    data by listening to our conversations."
                  </p>

                    "Advertisers can pair this voice-data with behavioral data
                    to target in-market consumers," the deck continues.

                  <p>
                    In the same slideshow, CMG counted Facebook, Google, and
                    Amazon as clients of its "Active Listening" service. After
                    <em>404</em> reached out to Google about its partnership,
                    the tech giant removed the media group from the site for its

                    >," which prompted Meta, the owner of Facebook, to admit
                    that it is reviewing CMG to see if it violates any of its
                    terms of service.

                  <p>
                    An Amazon spokesperson, meanwhile, told <em>404</em> that
                    its Ads arm "has never worked with CMG on this program and
                    has no plans to do so. The spox added, confusingly, that if
                    one of its marketing partners violates its rules, the
                    company will take action.

                    Another section of this web site talked about outside plant,
                    which is the telephone company's term for the cabling and
                    other equipment which connects your home telephone to their
                    Central Office.

                    This diagram shows an overview, and below are some pictures
                    and descriptions of how outside plant is different for rural
                    areas.

                  <p>
                    The main differences are that the Central Offices are
                    typically smaller, and the cable distances are much greater.

                      several things about a standard US telephone cabling that
                      I did not know before e.g. some cable is pressurized with
                      air to help prevent water ingress, but it provides
                      additional benefits to the engineers who have to maintain
                      the system.</em

                    A pioneering study titled "Causal effect of video gaming on
                    mental well-being in Japan 2020-2022," published in
                    <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>, has conducted the most
                    comprehensive investigation to date on the causal
                    relationship between video gaming and mental well-being.
                    This research, the first to demonstrate this relationship
                    using real-life data, challenges commonly held views about
                    the effects of gaming.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study found substantial improvements in mental
                    well-being: owning a Nintendo Switch improved mental health
                    by 0.60 standard deviations, while owning a PlayStation 5
                    improved it by 0.12 standard deviations. Additionally,
                    PlayStation 5 ownership increased life satisfaction by 0.23
                    standard deviations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our findings challenge common stereotypes about gaming
                    being harmful or merely providing temporary euphoria," said
                    lead author Hiroyuki Egami, PhD., Assistant Professor at
                    Nihon University. "We've shown that gaming can improve
                    mental health and life satisfaction across a broad spectrum
                    of individuals."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Egami further explained, "Many earlier studies drew
                    conclusions from correlational analysis with observational
                    data, which can't distinguish between cause and effect. Our
                    natural experimental design allows us to confidently say
                    that gaming actually leads to improved well-being, rather
                    than just being associated with it."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Notably, the study found that while the PlayStation 5
                    offered relatively smaller psychological benefits for
                    children, the Nintendo Switch provided larger psychological
                    benefits. These findings question the stereotype that games
                    are universally harmful to children and emphasize the
                    importance of considering the multifaceted nature of gaming,
                    including platforms, genres, and playing styles, in research
                    and policymaking.

                    The Linux kernel is not a place to work if you're not ready
                    for some, shall we say, spirited argument. Still, one key
                    developer in the project to expand Rust's place inside the
                    largely C-based kernel feels the "nontechnical nonsense" is
                    too much, so he's retiring.

                    to the Linux kernel mailing list last week to remove himself
                    as the project's maintainer. "After almost 4 years, I find
                    myself lacking the energy and enthusiasm I once had to
                    respond to some of the nontechnical nonsense, so it's best
                    to leave it up to those who still have it in them," Filho
                    wrote.<br />[...]<br />Filho also left a "sample for

                    "Here's the thing: you're not going to force all of us to
                    learn Rust." In the context of Filho's request that Linux's
                    file system implement Rust bindings, Ts'o says that while he
                    knows he must fix all the C code for any change he makes, he
                    cannot or will not fix the Rust bindings that may be
                    affected.<br />[...]<br />Drew DeVault, founder of

                    about Rust's attempts to find a place inside the Kernel. In
                    theory the kernel should welcome enthusiastic input from
                    motivated newcomers. "In practice, the Linux community is
                    the wild wild west, and sweeping changes are infamously
                    difficult to achieve consensus on, and this is by far the
                    broadest sweeping change ever proposed for the project,"
                    DeVault writes.<br />[...]<br />Rather than test their
                    patience with the kernel's politics, DeVault suggests Rust
                    developers build a Linux-compatible kernel from scratch.
                    "Freeing yourselves of the [Linux Kernel Mailing List]
                    political battles would probably be a big win for the
                    ambitions of bringing Rust into kernel space," DeVault
                    writes.<br />[...]<br />Linus Torvalds [...] took

                    "I was expecting [Rust] updates to be faster, but part of
                    the problem is that old-time kernel developers are used to C
                    and don't know Rust," Torvalds said. "They're not exactly
                    excited about having to learn a new language that is, in
                    some respects, very different. So there's been some pushback
                    on Rust." Torvalds added, however, that "another reason has
                    been the Rust infrastructure itself has not been super
                    stable."

                    Kim Dotcom, founder of the once wildly popular file-sharing
                    website Megaupload, lost a 12-year fight this week to halt
                    his deportation from New Zealand to the U.S. on charges of
                    copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to New Zealand's Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith,
                    the date for the extradition was not set, and Goldsmith said
                    Dotcom would be allowed "a short period of time to consider
                    and take advice" on the decision. "Don't worry I have a
                    plan," Dotcom posted on X this week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The saga stretches to the 2012 arrest of Dotcom in a
                    dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion, along with other
                    company officers. Prosecutors said Megaupload raked in at
                    least $175 million — mainly from people who used the site to
                    illegally download songs, television shows and movies —
                    before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dotcom has fought the order for years — lambasting the
                    investigation and arrests — but in 2021 New Zealand's
                    Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be
                    extradited. It remained up to the country's Justice Minister
                    to decide if the extradition should proceed.

                    Participants demonstrated a high degree of confidence in
                    their answers, suggesting that participants thought they had
                    a good understanding of the people in their out-group,
                    despite this not being the case. In comparison, participants
                    could consistently make accurate predictions about those in

                    "Our study shows that people have a good understanding of
                    people who are similar to themselves and their confidence in
                    their understanding is well-placed. However, our
                    understanding of people with different views to our own is
                    demonstrably poor. The more confident we are that we can
                    understand them, the more likely it is that we are wrong.
                    People have poor awareness of their inability to understand
                    people that differ from themselves," says Dr. Bryony Payne.

                    [...] Dr. Caroline Catmur, Reader in Cognitive Psychology at
                    King's IoPPN and the study's senior author, said, "We live
                    in an increasingly polarized society and many people are
                    very confident in their understanding of those who don't
                    share their beliefs. However, our research shows that people
                    are willing to reconsider once they are made aware of their
                    mistakes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "While there is no quick fix in a real-world setting, if
                    everyone interacted with a more diverse group of people,
                    talked directly to them and got to know them, it's likely we
                    would understand each other better. Conversations with
                    people who hold different beliefs could help challenge our
                    incorrect assumptions about each other."

                    [...] Despite the $10 gift cards sent to CrowdStrike's
                    partners who were working overtime to help customers recover
                    from the outage, it doesn't appear that the security vendor

                    to Mandiant, and its then-CEO Kevin Mandia's response to the
                    SolarWinds hack. "They got breached, their tools were

                    Imagine receiving a traffic ticket in the mail because you
                    were speeding down a Russian road in Kursk with a Ukrainian
                    attack drone on your tail. That's the reality facing some
                    Russians living near the front lines after Ukraine's
                    surprise seizure of Russian territory in Kursk Oblast. And
                    they're complaining about it on Telegram.

                    people are receiving speeding fines when trying to outrun
                    FPVs [first-person-view attack drones]. Some have resorted
                    to covering their license plates but the traffic police
                    force them to remove them."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Volunteers and military volunteers who arrived in the Kursk
                    region are asking the traffic police not to fine them for
                    speeding when they are escaping from the drones of the
                    Ukrainian Armed Forces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Several people who are near the combat zone told Mash about
                    this. Cameras are still recording violations in the border
                    area, and when people try to escape from the drones, they
                    receive letters of happiness [tickets]. One of the
                    well-known military activists was charged 9k [rubles,
                    apparently—about US$100] in just one day. He accelerated on
                    a highway that is attacked almost every hour by enemy FPV
                    drones. Some cover their license plates, but the traffic
                    police stop them and demand that they remove the stickers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mash claims that the traffic police are sympathetic and that
                    given the drone situation, "speeding can be considered as
                    committed in a state of extreme necessity." But those who
                    receive a speeding ticket will have to challenge it in court
                    on these grounds.

                    About five years ago I was suddenly, unexpectedly taken ill.
                    Not just 'that's a bit nasty' ill, but 'prepare for the
                    worst' ill. One thing that kept my spirits up in hospital,
                    in the long watches of the night, was listening to comedy
                    shows and audiobooks. I used my smartphone for this, since I
                    had it with me, and a pair of old, wired headphones that I
                    just had time to grab on my way to the ambulance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I survived, of course, as evidenced by my continued
                    ramblings on this site. But it was an unpleasant experience,
                    made just a little better by a simple piece of technology:
                    the 3.5mm headphone jack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, of course, I do own wireless headphones and earbuds – I
                    think almost everybody does. I also own several of those
                    irritating USB dongles, that provide a 3.5mm port for
                    devices that don't have one. But here's the problem: I can't
                    use my Bluetooth earbuds while they're charging. And I can't
                    easily charge my phone whilst it's connected to the USB
                    dongle. In a critical-care facility, it's hard enough to
                    find one free mains socket to connect a charger to, let
                    alone two./blockquote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] What makes the loss of the headphone jack so hard to
                    bear is that
                    <em>it wasn't done for the consumer's benefit</em>. To be
                    sure, manufacturers made certain claims about the alleged
                    benefits of losing the jack, but few of them stand up to
                    much logical scrutiny.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] No. All of these weak excuses are simply distractions
                    from the <em>real</em> reason Apple, Samsung, and Google
                    dropped the headphone jack: they all have a substantial
                    investment in the manufacture of wireless headphones.

                    A crew member aboard Boeing's CST-100 Starliner reported
                    hearing mysterious sonar-like sounds through the
                    spacecraft's speaker, sparking widespread speculation and
                    humor on social media. The noises, with no clear origin, led
                    to theories ranging from paranormal activity to technical
                    issues like electromagnetic interference. This incident
                    further complicated Boeing's ongoing efforts to prove the
                    Starliner's reliability, especially after previous
                    mechanical failures during its mission to the International
                    Space Station.

                    Teams from the University of Florida, Indiana University,
                    and other universities across the U.S. and Israel recently
                    conducted five eye-opening

                      >studies about rudeness</a
                    >, uncovering that even mild instances of this behavior can
                    significantly impair employees' performance. This could have
                    potentially life-threatening consequences in critical fields
                    like health care.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Many workplaces treat rudeness as a minor interpersonal
                    issue," said
                    <a
                      href="https://warrington.ufl.edu/directory/profiles/5084/"

                    Florida Warrington College of Business. "Our research shows
                    that it's a major threat to productivity and even safety.
                    Organizations should treat it as such."

                  <p>
                    Erez and his fellow researchers, who published their
                    findings in the
                    <a
                      href="https://psycnet.apa.org/PsycARTICLES/journal/apl/109/8"
                      ><em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em></a
                    >, evaluated teams in various settings (including a medical
                    simulation) and found that exposure to rude behavior
                    dramatically reduced team functioning. Surprisingly, the
                    impact of rudeness was disproportionate to its intensity. In
                    one study, relatively mild rude comments from an external
                    source accounted for 44% of the variance in medical teams'
                    performance quality.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The studies also discovered that rudeness functions as a
                    social threat, triggering defensive responses in team
                    members. This causes individuals to become less prosocial
                    and more selfish, hindering the cooperation and coordination
                    essential for effective teamwork. Specifically, teams
                    exposed to rudeness showed reduced information sharing and
                    workload sharing, which are two critical components of team
                    performance. In medical settings, this translated to poorer
                    execution of lifesaving procedures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] With this in mind, the researchers recommend that
                    organizations seek to implement solutions that help teams
                    prepare for dealing with perceived threatening situations
                    like rudeness. Training aimed at building team member
                    resilience and mindfulness, for example, may better prepare
                    employees for dealing with these situations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "As our understanding of workplace dynamics evolves, our
                    research underscores a critical point: in the quest for
                    high-performing teams, sometimes the smallest courtesies can
                    make the biggest difference," Erez said.

                    On 1 September 1974 two men made the fastest ever journey
                    between New York and London. The astonishing trip – at three
                    times the speed of sound – took less than two hours and set
                    a record that still stands 50 years later.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even the mighty Concorde, which set the record for the
                    fastest commercial transatlantic flight in 1996, straggled
                    in almost an hour behind.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The US air force Lockheed Blackbird SR-71 jet had a crew of
                    two – pilot James Sullivan and reconnaissance systems
                    operator Noel Widdifield – who completed the journey between
                    the two cities in one hour, 54 minutes and 56 seconds before
                    triumphantly landing to a fanfare welcome at the Farnborough
                    air show in Hampshire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The aircraft had to take on fuel twice: when it took
                    off, linking with a refuelling plane above California to
                    fill it to capacity, and partway during the journey near to
                    Greenland.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There was also an incident which would have looked
                    terrifying from the outside but which the crew took in their
                    stride. The Blackbird began to suddenly "yaw" – moving
                    swiftly from side to side – after losing thrust.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Blackbird took in air from the front to give thrust to
                    the engines, and it was common for a device in the inlet to
                    become displaced, causing one engine to lose much of its
                    power momentarily.

                    <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> is a hugely popular
                    roleplaying game enjoyed by millions of people all over the
                    world, both in person and online, every day.

                    However, new research has found it could be particularly
                    beneficial for people with autism, giving them a safe space
                    to engage in social interactions away from some of the
                    challenges they face in their daily lives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study, published in the journal <em>Autism</em>, was led
                    by researchers from the University of Plymouth's School of
                    Psychology along with colleagues at Edge Hill University and
                    Dalarna University in Sweden.

                    It saw researchers working with a group of autistic adults
                    and aimed to explore whether finding a social situation
                    where people felt comfortable could help them to excel.

                    After some initial familiarisation with
                    <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, the participants – under the

                    small groups over the space of six weeks.

                    They were then interviewed individually by the researchers
                    about the ways they felt their autism might have interacted
                    with their experiences and, in turn, whether taking part in
                    the game impacted their lives.

                  <p>
                    In those interviews, the participants spoke at length about
                    their social desires and motivations, but how this came with
                    challenges such as a lack of confidence in their
                    communication with others, and insecurities about how other
                    people would perceive them. This, they said, often resulted
                    in them masking, or hiding, autistic traits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Playing <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, they said, provided
                    them with a friendly environment in which they very quickly
                    felt a sense of innate kinship with others taking part.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Understanding common issues linked to activities inside and
                    outside of the game allowed them to relax without feeling
                    pressure to act in a certain way, and as a result they felt
                    included in – and able to better contribute to – the group's
                    interactions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The participants also felt able to take some of the traits
                    from their new character outside of the game, where it
                    enabled them to feel differently about themselves.

                    [...] Another recently published study showed that those
                    with autism enjoy board games because they took the pressure
                    off the uncertainty around meeting and interacting with
                    people, removing the need for small talk.

                    Most EU member states see a large proportion of their
                    teaching vacancies unfilled at the start of each school
                    year, often thanks to low wages, high workload, and an
                    ageing teacher population.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sweden has been reported as one of the worst affected, with
                    153,000 qualified teachers needed by 2035.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Only Croatia and Cyprus did not report a lack of education
                    staff, according to the European Commission's Education and
                    Training Monitor 2023 report, while Greece's existing public
                    data does not allow it to assess whether all needs are
                    covered or if specific subjects might suffer shortages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most countries face teacher shortages specifically in STEM
                    subjects and qualified personnel in early childhood
                    education and care.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Germany's Education and Science Workers' Union, GEW, has
                    warned "against lowering the standards for pedagogical
                    qualifications to compensate for the shortage of staff."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, an EU-level solution might be difficult to
                    implement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "One of the reasons why it is difficult to come up with a
                    European comparable cross-country indicator on teacher
                    shortage is because countries have different educational
                    institutional rules," wrote education economist Giorgio Di
                    Pietro in a technical report for the EU's Joint Research
                    Centre.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For instance, formal teaching qualifications can be
                    obtained in different ways in different countries. In some
                    countries, one automatically becomes a teacher when they
                    complete the teacher preparation programme, while in others
                    there are additional steps to complete."

                    Fossils are used to reconstruct evolutionary history, but
                    not all animals and plants become fossils and many fossils
                    are destroyed before we can find them (e.g., the rocks that
                    contain the fossils are destroyed by erosion). As a result,
                    the fossil record has gaps and is incomplete, and we're
                    missing data that we need to reconstruct evolutionary
                    history.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, a team of sedimentologists and stratigraphers from the
                    Netherlands and the UK have examined how this incompleteness
                    influences the reconstruction of evolutionary history. To
                    their surprise, they found that the incompleteness itself is
                    actually not such a big issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's as if you are missing half of a movie. If you are
                    missing the second half, you can't understand the story, but
                    if you are missing every second frame, you can still follow
                    the plot without problems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The regularity of the gaps, rather than the incompleteness
                    itself, is what determines the reconstruction of
                    evolutionary history," explains Niklas Hohmann of Utrecht
                    University's Faculty of Geosciences, who led the study. "If
                    a lot of data is missing, but the gaps are regular, we could
                    still reconstruct evolutionary history without major
                    problems, but if the gaps get too long and irregular,
                    results are strongly biased."

                  <p>
                    Since Charles Darwin published his theory of evolution, the
                    incompleteness of the fossil record has been considered
                    problematic for reconstructing evolutionary history from
                    fossils. Darwin feared that the gradual change that his
                    theory predicted would not be recognizable in the fossil
                    record due to all the gaps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our results show that this fear is unjustified. We have a
                    good understanding of where the gaps are, how long they are
                    and what causes them. With this geological knowledge, we can
                    reconstruct evolution hundreds of millions of years ago at
                    an unprecedented temporal resolution," says Hohmann.

                        I panicked. There were URLs in my database! There were
                        URLs pointing to catgirls.win in my database!! Something
                        was very very wrong.

                        I assumed I'd been hacked. I poured over my logs,
                        looking for evidence of an intrusion. I read and re-read
                        my code, searching for how somebody could be stuffing
                        strings into a database that should have just contained
                        0s and 1s.

                        I couldn't find anything. My access logs looked fine. My
                        (very simple) code was ok. My heart rate increased. My
                        girlfriend patiently waited for me to join her for
                        dinner. And then — wait.

                    Using observations from a NASA suborbital rocket, an
                    international team of scientists has, for the first time,
                    successfully measured a planet-wide electric field thought
                    to be as fundamental to Earth as its gravity and magnetic
                    fields. Known as the ambipolar electric field, scientists
                    first hypothesized over 60 years ago that it drove how our
                    planet's atmosphere can escape above Earth's North and South
                    Poles. Measurements from the rocket,

                      href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/sounding-rockets/nasa-rocket-to-measure-earths-life-supporting-secret-a-weak-electric-field/"
                      >NASA's Endurance mission</a
                    >, have confirmed the existence of the ambipolar field and
                    quantified its strength, revealing its role in driving
                    atmospheric escape and shaping our ionosphere — a layer of
                    the upper atmosphere — more broadly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since the late 1960s, spacecraft flying over Earth's
                    poles have detected a stream of particles flowing from our
                    atmosphere into space. Theorists predicted this outflow,
                    which they dubbed the "polar wind," spurring research to
                    understand its causes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some amount of outflow from our atmosphere was expected.
                    Intense, unfiltered sunlight should cause some particles
                    from our air to escape into space, like steam evaporating
                    from a pot of water. But the observed polar wind was more
                    mysterious. Many particles within it were cold, with no
                    signs they had been heated — yet they were traveling at
                    supersonic speeds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The hypothesized electric field, generated at the
                    subatomic scale, was expected to be incredibly weak, with
                    its effects felt only over hundreds of miles. For decades,
                    detecting it was beyond the limits of existing technology.
                    In 2016, Collinson and his team got to work inventing a new
                    instrument they thought was up to the task of measuring
                    Earth's ambipolar field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Endurance's discovery has opened many new paths for
                    exploration. The ambipolar field, as a fundamental energy
                    field of our planet alongside gravity and magnetism, may
                    have continuously shaped the evolution of our atmosphere in
                    ways we can now begin to explore. Because it's created by
                    the internal dynamics of an atmosphere, similar electric
                    fields are expected to exist on other planets, including
                    Venus and Mars.

                    Microsoft has donated the Mono Project, an open-source

                    systems, to the Wine community. WineHQ will be

                  <p>
                    [...] Mono began as a project of Miguel de Icaza, co-creator
                    of the GNOME desktop. De Icaza led Ximian (originally Helix
                    Code), aiming to bring Microsoft's then-new .NET platform to
                    Unix-like platforms. Ximian was acquired by Novell in 2003.

                  <p>
                    By 2011, however, Novell, on its way to being acquired into
                    obsolescence, was not doing much with Mono, and de Icaza
                    started Xamarin to push Mono for Android. Novell (through
                    its SUSE subsidiary) and Xamarin reached
                    <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/OTY4Mg"
                      >an agreement</a
                    >
                    in which Xamarin would take over the IP and customers, using
                    Mono inside Novell/SUSE.

                  <p>
                    What does this mean for Mono and Wine? Not much at first.
                    Wine, a compatibility layer for Windows apps on
                    POSIX-compliant systems, has already made use of Mono code
                    in fixes and
                    <a href="https://github.com/madewokherd/wine-mono"
                      >has its own Mono engine</a
                    >. By donating Mono to Wine, Microsoft has, at a minimum,
                    erased the last bit of concern anyone might have had about
                    the company's control of the project. It's a very different,
                    open-source-conversant Microsoft making this move, of
                    course, but regardless, it's a good gesture.

                    The European Union and China have launched an initiative
                    aimed at addressing issues faced by European companies in
                    the Middle Kingdom related to the transfer of non-personal
                    data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The effort goes by the very sexy name "<a

                  <p>
                    The goal is to address concerns about China's restrictive
                    data export laws, which have left European businesses unsure
                    about what they’re allowed to do with data collected in
                    China – particularly in sectors like finance, pharma,
                    automotive, and ICT.

                  <p>
                    The European Commission has specific concerns around vague
                    language regarding China's requirements to obtain security
                    approvals for exports of all "important data." Beijing has
                    not offered a solid definition of that term – leaving
                    Europeans concerned it could be applied broadly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The initiative is intended to "focus on practical
                    solutions."

                    [...] Beijing has long sought to control how its domestic
                    businesses store their data. It is known to take action –
                    including pulling apps and blocking IPOs – against

                    [...] The European Commission stated on Monday that the
                    cross-border data transfer restrictions are "a major
                    contributing factor to the declining confidence of European
                    investors in China."

                    [...] While China is careful not to let customer data about
                    its citizens leave its shores, it has a reputation for being
                    happy to slurp up the data of other countries' people.

                    Other countries have started to take notice. Earlier this
                    month, Kakao Pay – a subsidiary of Korea's WhatsApp analog
                    Kakao – got in trouble with regulators for sharing the data
                    of more than 40 million users with a subsidiary of Alipay, a
                    company under the umbrella of Chinese-owned Alibaba.

                    But isn't that just magnification, then? No—because
                    magnification only makes things bigger! This is easy to
                    demonstrate with a photograph: you can zoom in on the
                    photograph as much as you'd like, but past a certain limit,
                    you're just magnifying the pixels, and you can't get any
                    more information out of it. To break through that wall, you
                    have to gain resolution rather than magnification.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] At its best, Hubble's resolution is about 0.05
                    arcsecond—a <em>very</em> tiny angle! But how much detail it
                    can see in real terms depends on the target's distance and
                    physical size. For example, 0.05 arcsecond is equivalent to
                    the apparent size of a dime seen from about 140 kilometers
                    away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That brings us back to the conspiracy theorists and their
                    gripe about spotting boot prints on the moon. Galaxies are
                    typically tens of millions or even billions of light-years
                    from Earth. At those distances, Hubble can resolve objects a
                    few light-years across—tens of <em>trillions</em> of
                    kilometers—at best. So while it looks like we're seeing
                    galaxies in great detail in those spectacular Hubble images,
                    the smallest thing we can see is still tremendously huge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile the moon is only about 380,000 km from us—and from
                    Hubble. At that distance, Hubble's resolution surprisingly
                    limits it to resolving objects no smaller than about 90
                    meters across. So not only can we <em>not</em> see the
                    astronauts' boot prints in Hubble images but we also can't
                    even see the Apollo lunar landers, which were only about
                    four meters across!

                    In the spring of 2023, when the new planting season was to
                    start, Tope’s company, Carmi Agro Foods, had used
                    GPS-enabled software to map the boundaries of its farm. Its
                    setup on the EOS crop monitoring platform was also
                    completed. Tope used the platform to determine the
                    appropriate spacing for the stems and seeds. The rigors and
                    risks of manual monitoring had disappeared. His
                    field-monitoring officers needed only to peer at their
                    phones to know where or when specific spots needed attention
                    on various farms. He was able to track weed breakouts
                    quickly and efficiently. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This technology is gaining traction among farmers in other
                    parts of Nigeria and the rest of Africa. More than 242,000
                    people in Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, the United
                    States, and Europe use the EOS crop-monitoring platform. In
                    2023 alone, 53,000 more farmers subscribed to the service.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of them is Adewale Adegoke, the CEO of Agro Xchange
                    Technology Services, a company dedicated to boosting crop
                    yields using technology and good agricultural practices.
                    Adegoke used the platform on half a million hectares (around
                    1.25 million acres) owned by 63,000 farmers. He says the
                    yield of maize farmers using the platform, for instance,
                    grew to two tons per acre, at least twice the national
                    average.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Adegoke adds that local farmers, who have been struggling
                    with fluctuating conditions as a result of climate change,
                    have been especially drawn to the platform’s early warning
                    system for weather. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As harvest time draws nearer this year, Tope reports, the
                    prospects of his cassava field, which now spans a thousand
                    hectares, is quite promising. This is thanks in part to his
                    ability to anticipate and counter the sudden dry spells. He
                    spaced the plantings better and then followed advisories on
                    weeding, fertilizer use, and other issues related to the
                    health of the crops. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “So far, the result has been convincing,” says Tope. “We are
                    no longer subjecting the performance of our farms to chance.
                    This time, we are in charge.”

                    Some companies have backtracked more than Ford. Tractor
                    Supply, for example, <a

                    that it will withdraw its carbon emission reduction goals
                    and eliminate jobs and goals focused on diversity, equity
                    and inclusion. It will also stop sponsoring LGBTQ+ Pride
                    festivals and voting campaigns
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Starbuck, a former Hollywood music video director turned
                    conservative activist, has claimed credit for these moves.
                    But business experts have told CNN that Starbuck's activism
                    alone does not fully explain these decisions, and some
                    companies' commitments to diversity and inclusion were thin
                    to start.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Human Rights Campaign criticized Ford's announcement,
                    saying the company was "abandoning inclusive employees
                    policies and support" and "cowering" to Starbuck.

                  <p>
                    "Ford Motor Company's shortsighted decisions will have
                    long-term consequences," Human Rights Campaign President
                    Kelley Robinson said in a news release Wednesday. "Ford
                    Motor Company is abandoning its financial duty to recruit
                    and keep top talent from across the full talent pool. In
                    making their purchasing decisions, consumers should take
                    note that Ford Motor Company has abandoned its commitment to
                    our communities."

                    [...] This vulnerability was originally discovered by
                    examining our honeypot logs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The vulnerability lies in the brightness function within the
                    file /cgi-bin/supervisor/Factory.cgi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the exploit examples we observed, essentially what
                    happened is this: The exploit of this vulnerability allows
                    an attacker to execute remote code on a target system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Figure 3 is an example of a threat actor exploiting this
                    flaw to download and run a JavaScript file to fetch and load
                    their main malware payload. Similar to many other botnets,
                    this one is also spreading a variant of Mirai malware to its
                    targets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this instance, the botnet is likely using the Corona
                    Mirai variant, which has been referenced by other vendors as
                    early as 2020 in relation to the COVID-19 virus.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Upon execution, the malware connects to a large number of
                    hosts through Telnet on ports 23, 2323, and 37215. It also
                    prints the string “Corona” to the console on an infected
                    host (Figure 4).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Static analysis of the strings in the malware samples shows
                    targeting of the path /ctrlt/DeviceUpgrade_1 in an attempt
                    to exploit Huawei devices affected by CVE-2017-17215. The
                    samples have two hard-coded command and control IP
                    addresses, one of which is part of the CVE-2017-17215
                    exploit code:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The botnet also targeted several other vulnerabilities
                    including a Hadoop YARN RCE, CVE-2014-8361, and
                    CVE-2017-17215. We have observed these vulnerabilities
                    exploited in the wild several times, and they continue to be
                    successful.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Given that this camera model is no longer supported, the
                    best course of action for anyone using one is to replace it.
                    As with all Internet-connected devices, IoT devices should
                    never be accessible using the default credentials that
                    shipped with them.

                    Accounts that the platform previously has shut down on
                    Brazilian orders include lawmakers affiliated with former
                    President Jair Bolsonaro's right-wing party and activists
                    accused of undermining Brazilian democracy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Musk, a self-proclaimed "free speech absolutist," has
                    repeatedly claimed the justice's actions amount to
                    censorship, and his argument has been echoed by Brazil's
                    political right. He has often insulted de Moraes on his
                    platform, characterizing him as a dictator and tyrant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    De Moraes' defenders have said his actions aimed at X have
                    been lawful, supported by most of the court's full bench and
                    have served to protect democracy at a time in which it is
                    imperiled. His order Friday is based on Brazilian law
                    requiring foreign companies to have representation in the
                    country so they can be notified when there are legal cases
                    against them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Given that operators are aware of the widely publicized
                    standoff and their obligation to comply with an order from
                    de Moraes, plus the fact doing so isn't complicated, X could
                    be offline as early as 12 hours after receiving their
                    instructions, said Luca Belli, coordinator of the Technology
                    and Society Center at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a
                    university in Rio de Janeiro.

                  <p>The shutdown is not unprecedented in Brazil.</p>
                  <p>
                    Lone Brazilian judges shut down Meta's WhatsApp, the
                    nation's most widely used messaging app, several times in
                    2015 and 2016 due to the company's refusal to comply with
                    police requests for user data. In 2022, de Moraes threatened
                    the messaging app Telegram with a nationwide shutdown,
                    arguing it had repeatedly ignored Brazilian authorities'
                    requests to block profiles and provide information. He
                    ordered Telegram to appoint a local representative; the
                    company ultimately complied and stayed online.

                  <p>
                    X and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in
                    several countries — mostly authoritarian regimes such as
                    Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and
                    Turkmenistan. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Turkey and
                    Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to
                    quell dissent and unrest. Twitter was banned in Egypt after
                    the Arab Spring uprisings, which some dubbed the "Twitter
                    revolution," but it has since been restored.

                    To retrieve past stress information, LNNO is applied as a
                    coating on the surface of an object and then irradiated with
                    a flashlight. The afterglow produced by LNNO can be measured
                    using cameras or light sensors. The study demonstrated that
                    the afterglow image matches quantitatively with the results
                    obtained through finite element method analysis.
                    Additionally, the research confirmed that LNNO retains this
                    stress information even after a period of five months.

                    will also continue to be operated by Future's community team
                    and our dedicated troop of moderators. With forum threads
                    going back to 1999 (and some active members just as long),
                    the forums have a history almost as long and as storied as
                    AnandTech itself (wounded monitor children, anyone?). So
                    even when AnandTech is no longer publishing articles, we'll
                    still have a place for everyone to talk about the latest in
                    technology – and have those discussions last longer than 48
                    hours.

                    is continuing to cover the world of technology. There are a
                    couple of familiar AnandTech faces already over there
                    providing their accumulated expertise, and the site will
                    continue doing its best to provide a written take on
                    technology news.

                    [...] Finally, I'd like to end this piece with a comment on
                    the Cable TV-ification of the web. A core belief that Anand
                    and I have held dear for years, and is still on our

                    to this day, is AnandTech's rebuke of sensationalism, link
                    baiting, and the path to shallow 10-o'clock-news reporting.
                    It has been our mission over the past 27 years to inform and
                    educate our readers by providing high-quality content – and
                    while we're no longer going to be able to fulfill that role,
                    the need for quality, in-depth reporting has not changed. If
                    anything, the need has increased as social media and
                    changing advertising landscapes have made shallow,
                    sensationalistic reporting all the more lucrative.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For all the tech journalists out there right now – or tech
                    journalists to be – I implore you to remain true to
                    yourself, and to your readers' needs. In-depth reporting
                    isn't always as sexy or as exciting as other avenues, but
                    now, more than ever, it's necessary to counter
                    sensationalism and cynicism with high-quality reporting and
                    testing that is used to support thoughtful conclusions. To
                    quote Anand: "I don't believe the web needs to be academic
                    reporting or sensationalist garbage - as long as there's a
                    balance, I'm happy."

                    King and her UC Berkeley colleagues described the organism —
                    which they named <i>Barroeca monosierra,</i> after the lake
                    — in a paper published in the journal <i>mBio</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nearly 10 years ago, then-UC Berkeley graduate student
                    Daniel Richter came back from a climbing trip in the Eastern
                    Sierra Nevada with a vial of Mono Lake water he’d casually
                    collected along the way. Under the microscope, it was alive
                    with choanoflagellates. Other than brine shrimp, alkali
                    flies and various species of nematode, few other forms of
                    life have been reported to live in the inhospitable waters
                    of the lake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] At the time, however, King was occupied with
                    <a
                      href="https://www.hhmi.org/news/newly-discovered-microorganisms-band-together-flip-out"
                      >other species of choanos</a
                    >, as she calls them, so the Mono Lake choanos languished in
                    the freezer until some students revived and stained them to
                    look at their unusual, doughnut-shaped chromosomes.
                    Surprisingly, there was also DNA inside the hollow colony
                    where there should have been no cells. After further
                    investigation, graduate student Kayley Hake determined that
                    they were bacteria.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The bacteria were a huge surprise. That just was
                    fascinating,” King said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hake also detected connective structures, called
                    extracellular matrix, inside the spherical colony that were
                    secreted by the choanos. Only then did it occur to Hake and
                    King that these might not be the remains of bacteria the
                    choanos ate, but bacteria living and grazing on stuff
                    secreted by the colony.

                    "told Lacey during Wednesday's sentencing he was aware of

                  <p>
                    This post introduces some tricks for jailbreaking hosts
                    behind "secure" enterprise firewalls in order to enable
                    arbitrary inbound and outbound requests over any protocol.
                    You'll probably find the tricks outlined in the post useful
                    if you need to deploy software in a hostile networking
                    environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The motivation for these tricks is that you might be a
                    vendor that sells software that runs in a customer's
                    datacenter (a.k.a. on-premises software), so your software
                    has to run inside of a restricted network environment. You
                    (the vendor) can ask the customer to open their firewall for
                    your software to communicate with the outside world (e.g.
                    your own datacenter or third party services), but customers
                    will usually be reluctant to open their firewall more than
                    necessary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, you might want to ssh into your host so that
                    you can service, maintain, or upgrade the host, but if you
                    ask the customer to open their firewall to let you ssh in
                    they'll usually push back on or outright reject the request.
                    Moreover, this isn't one of those situations where you can
                    just ask for forgiveness instead of permission because you
                    can't begin to do anything without explicitly requesting
                    some sort of firewall change on their part.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So I'm about to teach you a bunch of tricks for efficiently
                    tunneling whatever you want over seemingly innocuous
                    openings in a customer's firewall.....

                We are not condoning such actions, but you cannot secure your

                    in a viral "blackout challenge" in which users of the social

                    U.S. Circuit Judge Patty Shwartz, writing for the

                    Communications Decency Act of 1996 only immunizes
                    information provided by third parties and not

                    rulings by her court and others holding that Section 230

                    social media platforms to curb content they deem
                    objectionable violate their free speech rights.<br />In
                    those cases, the Supreme Court held a platform's algorithm
                    reflects "editorial judgments" about "compiling the
                    third-party speech it wants in the way it wants." Shwartz
                    said under that logic, content curation using algorithms is
                    speech by the company itself, which is not protected by
                    Section 230.

                    "TikTok makes choices about the content recommended and

                    its own first-party speech," she wrote.

                    Forcing customers to replace an entire system just because
                    the cheapest component failed might be really profitable, I
                    have no idea... But I do know that it annoyed me enough to
                    make me want to fix it myself. While I understand that what
                    I do next is beyond a large number of Advantage Air
                    customers, in my investigation I found that there seems to
                    be only software choices preventing modern tablets from
                    working with older control systems. Adding a simple "system"
                    chooser to their software applications would give solutions
                    to everyone, while the custom POE connector would ensure
                    they still need their hardware.

                    My family had a new home built in 2019. As part of the build
                    package a large ducted reverse cycle (heatpump) air
                    conditioning system was installed. As it was part of the
                    entire build I am not sure on the specific price of this
                    system but based on other quotes I have seen for a similar
                    sized house I would guess $10k-$12k. The system has two main
                    parts, the actual Daikin airconditioner and an Advantage Air
                    control box in attic that opens the vents to the various
                    zones. This control system is operated by a cheap POE
                    powered Android tablet on the wall of the living room.

                    [...] E-Zone running perfectly on an ancient Samsung Galaxy
                    Tab 4. I was elated. After I gave up on repairing the
                    original, getting this tablet working took only a few hours
                    and was a hell of a lot of fun. This tablet is 10+ years old
                    and yet still is much snappier than the junk that came with
                    the system, but if I want to upgrade to something more
                    powerful, say to control my homeassistant etc... all I need
                    to do is plug it into the usb. But for turning the AC on and
                    off it is more than enough and I am currently waiting on a
                    nice flush connector to arrive then will mount it on the
                    wall.

                    The team used an attosecond X-ray pulse from SLAC’s
                    <a href="https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/"
                      >Linac Coherent Light Source</a

                    (LCLS), just billionths of a billionth of a second long, to
                    ionize core-level electrons. This process ejected the
                    electrons from the molecules they were studying. They then
                    used a separate laser pulse, which kicked the electrons in a
                    slightly different direction depending on the time they were
                    emitted, to measure the so-called “photoemission delay.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The photoemission delay can be thought of as the time
                    between a molecule absorbing a photon and emitting an
                    electron. These delays, reaching up to 700 attoseconds, were
                    significantly larger than previously predicted, challenging
                    existing theoretical models and opening new avenues for
                    understanding electron behavior. The researchers also
                    discovered that interactions between electrons played an
                    important role in this delay.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “By measuring the angular difference in the direction of the
                    ejected electrons, we could determine the time delay with
                    high precision,” said co-author and SLAC scientist James
                    Cryan. “The ability to measure and interpret these delays
                    helps scientists better analyze experimental results,
                    particularly in fields like protein crystallography and
                    medical imaging, where X-ray interactions with matter are
                    crucial.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study is one of the first in a series of planned
                    experiments aimed at exploring the depths of electron
                    dynamics in different molecular systems. Other research
                    groups have already started using the developed technique to
                    study larger and more complex molecules, revealing new
                    facets of electron behavior and molecular structure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “This is a developing field,” said co-author Agostino
                    Marinelli. “The flexibility of LCLS allows us to probe a
                    wide range of energies and molecular systems, making it a
                    powerful tool for making these types of measurements. This
                    is just the beginning of what we can achieve on these
                    extreme timescales.”

                    The bill, which has been a flashpoint for debate in Silicon
                    Valley and beyond, would obligate AI companies operating in
                    California to implement a number of precautions before they
                    train a sophisticated foundation model. Those include making
                    it possible to quickly and fully shut the model down,
                    ensuring the model is protected against “unsafe
                    post-training modifications,” and maintaining a testing
                    procedure to evaluate whether a model or its derivatives is
                    especially at risk of “causing or enabling a critical harm.”

                    SB 1047 is a highly reasonable bill that asks large AI labs
                    to do what they’ve already committed to doing: test their
                    large models for catastrophic safety risk. “We’ve worked
                    hard all year, with open source advocates, Anthropic, and
                    others, to refine and improve the bill. SB 1047 is well
                    calibrated to what we know about forseeable AI risks, and it
                    deserves to be enacted.”

                    With impressive speed and candor, Rocket Factory Augsburg
                    (RFA) has provided an update on the anomaly that caused last
                    week's rocket firing at SaxaVord in Shetland, Scotland, to
                    end explosively.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first stage of RFA's rocket explodes on the SaxaVord
                    launchpad
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Brieschenk described the anomaly as "a very unusual one."
                    The leading theory is that there was a fire in an oxygen
                    pump, which is difficult to contain and certainly more than
                    the systems on the stage and launch pad could handle. The
                    damage rapidly spread to the other engines, and despite the
                    stage triggering an emergency stop, the explosion happened
                    shortly after.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The horizontal jet of flame from the base of the stage was
                    indicative of the severity of the damage. Brieschenk
                    explained that the compromised engines had damaged the
                    manifold to such an extent that kerosene began leaking from
                    the vent lines. "That was really the point of no return," he
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The kerosene fueled the fire. The flames grew more intense
                    and eventually became an oxygen-fed blaze so severe that
                    "large portions of engines were simply combusted."
                    Brieschenk said the CO<sub>2</sub> and water fire
                    suppression systems were not adequately sized to deal with
                    the unfolding damage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite the inevitable delay following the explosion,
                    Brieschenk was keen to highlight that the stage collapsed in
                    a manner which caused it to topple away from the launch
                    pad's umbilical tower. As a result, the pad remained
                    relatively unscathed, aside from elements like the launch
                    stool that were designed to support the stage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although Brieschenk said RFA was confident in the design of
                    the offending turbopump, he also noted that more than 100
                    improvements were being made to the next first stage, which
                    is currently under construction. Many of these improvements
                    aim to prevent a repeat of the SaxaVord incident, where a
                    single turbopump failure led to the loss of the entire
                    stage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The need to wait for the completion of this first stage,
                    originally intended for the second flight of the RFA One,
                    means that the inaugural launch has been postponed to 2025.
                    The other components, like the second stage, for example,
                    are already at SaxaVord.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company said it was being as transparent as possible
                    regarding the mishap and was sharing its own raw footage of
                    the incident. It wrote: "Maybe other companies or
                    prospective engineers can learn from it."
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    spectacular, and it has cost us quite some money to
                    generate."

                    Like many, Sam Curry and I spend a lot of time waiting in
                    airport security lines. If you do this enough, you might
                    sometimes see a special lane at airport security called
                    Known Crewmember (KCM). KCM is a TSA program that allows
                    pilots and flight attendants to bypass security screening,
                    even when flying on domestic personal trips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The KCM process is fairly simple: the employee uses the
                    dedicated lane and presents their KCM barcode or provides
                    the TSA agent their employee number and airline. Various
                    forms of ID need to be presented while the TSA agent's
                    laptop verifies the employment status with the airline. If
                    successful, the employee can access the sterile area without
                    any screening at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A similar system also exists for cockpit access, called the
                    Cockpit Access Security System (CASS). Most aircraft have at
                    least one jumpseat inside the cockpit sitting behind the
                    flying pilots. When pilots need to commute or travel, it is
                    not always possible for them to occupy a revenue seat, so a
                    jumpseat can be used instead. CASS allows the gate agent of
                    a flight to verify that the jumpseater is an authorized
                    pilot. The gate agent can then inform the crew of the flight
                    that the jumpseater was authenticated by CASS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The employment status check is the most critical component
                    of these processes. If the individual doesn't currently work
                    for an airline, they have not had a background check and
                    should not be permitted to bypass security screening or
                    access the cockpit. This process is also responsible for
                    returning the photo of the crewmember to ensure the right
                    person is being authorized for access. So how does this
                    work, when every airline presumably uses a different system
                    to store their employee information? That is what we were
                    wondering, and where it gets interesting...

                    Over the past few decades, scientists have generated a pile
                    of evidence suggesting that a diet rich in saturated fats is
                    enough to cause heart diseases. Besides other problems like
                    diabetes and atherosclerosis, saturated fats have also been
                    linked to life-threatening arrhythmias.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Interestingly, based on animal and human studies, certain
                    omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids seem to have beneficial
                    effects on cardiovascular health. In particular,
                    eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which is found in fish oil, not
                    only has vasodilator and antiplatelet effects, but can even
                    help prevent atrial fibrillation and other arrythmias.
                    Despite EPA being readily available as a dietary supplement,
                    the effect of EPA on cardiomyocytes and their underlying
                    mechanisms of action are not fully understood.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a recent study published online in the
                    <em>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</em>, a
                    research team from Japan set out to bridge this knowledge
                    gap. Led by Associate Professor Masaki Morishima from Kindai
                    University, they investigated the role of EPA in inducing
                    long-term electrical changes in cultured mouse
                    cardiomyocytes using a variety of bioanalytical techniques.
                    Their research article was co-authored by Dr. Katsushige Ono
                    from Oita University and Dr. Kazuki Horikawa from Tokushima
                    University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The main focus of this work was on how an oleic
                    acid/palmitic acid mixture (OAPA), two well-studied
                    saturated fats, impact calcium homeostasis in cardiomyocytes
                    by affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion channels, and whether EPA
                    can rescue these changes and restore normal functioning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Put together, this study has shed some much needed
                    light on the underlying mechanisms by which EPA could
                    bolster heart health. “Although there are techniques and
                    drugs to control arrythmias, methods to prevent them have
                    not been established,” remarks Dr. Morishima. Adding
                    further, she states, “The results of our study suggest that
                    EPA has a protective effect on cardiomyocytes by normalizing
                    abnormalities caused by the intake of excessive amounts of
                    saturated fatty acids, which occurs in high-fat diets.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team envisions that these findings will pave the way for
                    smarter dietary choices and new health guidelines. “While
                    research on nutrients and disease prevention can take a long
                    time, studies like ours lay the groundwork for practical
                    nutritional strategies that could seamlessly fit into
                    everyday diet,” concludes Dr. Morishima, hoping for a
                    healthier future.

                    This is Part 1 of a series of articles investigating various
                    PC floppy protections, as I get them working in MartyPC. It
                    assumes you have a familiarity with the structure of a PC
                    floppy disk and the basic operation of a PC floppy drive.

                  <p>
                    Formaster called their copy protection technology
                    "Copy-Lock," a name which, unfortunately, several other
                    producers of copy-protection technology used for entirely
                    unrelated methods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Formaster flavor of Copy-Lock was not used exclusively
                    on PC - the Series One supported many other different
                    computers such as the Apple II and Commodore 64. Copy
                    protection schemes on those platforms could be much more
                    advanced. This article will specifically look at Copy-Lock
                    as it appeared on the IBM PC platform.

                    When he purchased the album for $2 million in 2015, he also
                    acquired 50 percent of the copyrights to the package. Before
                    the album was seized by the government, Shkreli says he took
                    advantage of his copyright ownership to make copies as he
                    was "permitted to do under his original purchase
                    agreement."<br />[...]<br />On August 26, 2024, a federal
                    judge in Brooklyn issued a

                    (PDF) in the case as the two parties prepare to battle
                    things out in court. The injunction prevents Shkreli from
                    "possessing, using, disseminating, or selling any interest
                    in the Wu-Tang Clan album 'Once Upon a Time in Shaolin' (the
                    'Album'), including its data and files or the contents of
                    the Album."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, Shkreli has to turn over "all of his copies, in
                    any form, of the Album or its contents to defense counsel."
                    He also must file an affidavit swearing that he "no longer
                    possesses any copies, in any form, of the Album or its
                    contents."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By the end of September 2024, Shkreli further must submit a
                    list of "the names and contact information of the
                    individuals to whom he distributed the data and files" and
                    say if he made any money for doing so.

                The article goes into detail on the steps that were required,
                including finding an operational pay phone, and it ends with the
                steps summarized:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>~~ A Step-by-Step Guide ~~</p>
                  <p>
                    1. Obtain a phone. It doesn't need to have an active phone
                    number associated with it, and can be either an old phone
                    you have around or a dedicated burner phone.
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Locate a pay phone.</p>
                  <p>
                    3. Find the pay phone's phone number (call 1-800-444-4444 if
                    it's not written on the phone).
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Make sure the pay phone can receive incoming calls.</p>
                  <p>
                    5. Enter the pay phone number into Signal, and use the 'Call
                    me' option to receive a verification call (this option shows
                    up only after the SMS timer runs out).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    6. Input the confirmation code, set up a PIN and enable
                    Registration Lock in the Signal app.
