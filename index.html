              <p>
                I came across an interesting blog post that suggests the Web is
                splitting into two with an offshoot made up of a commercial
                dystopia that is increasingly viewed as the "normal web,"
                leaving an insurmountable chasm developing between the two.
                Regular readers of SN will appreciate the points made, but do
                you agree with them, particularly where you'll eventually need
                to pick one side or the other?

                  <p>
                    There's an increasing chasm dividing the modern web. On one
                    side, the commercial, monopolies-riddled, media-adored web.
                    A web which has only one objective: making us click. It
                    measures clicks, optimises clicks, generates clicks. It
                    gathers as much information as it could about us and spams
                    every second of our life with ads, beep, notifications,
                    vibrations, blinking LEDs, background music and fluorescent
                    titles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A web which boils down to Idiocracy in a Blade Runner
                    landscape, a complete cyberpunk dystopia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then there's the tech-savvy web. People who install
                    adblockers or alternative browsers. People who try
                    alternative networks such as Mastodon or, God forbid,
                    Gemini. People who poke fun at the modern web by building
                    true HTML and JavaScript-less pages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Between those two extremes, the gap is widening. You have to
                    choose your camp. When browsing on the "normal web", it is
                    increasingly required to disable at least part of your
                    antifeatures-blockers to access content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Something strange is happening: it's not only a part
                    of the web which is disappearing for me. As I'm blocking
                    completely google analytics, every Facebook domain and any
                    analytics I can, I'm also disappearing for them. I don't see
                    them and they don't see me!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Think about it! That whole "MBA, designers and marketers
                    web" is now optimised thanks to analytics describing people
                    who don't block analytics (and bots pretending to be those
                    people). Each day, I feel more disconnected from that part
                    of the web.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It feels like everyone is now choosing its side. You
                    can't stay in the middle anymore. You are either dedicating
                    all your CPU cycles to run JavaScript tracking you or
                    walking away from the big monopolies. You are either being
                    paid to build huge advertising billboards on top of yet
                    another framework or you are handcrafting HTML.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Maybe the web is not dying. Maybe the web is only splitting
                    itself in two.

                    Ramsey numbers can be thought of as representing the
                    boundaries of disorder. And it's notoriously hard to figure
                    them out.

                    Since mathematician Frank Ramsey proved

                      >Ramsey's Theorem</a
                    >
                    in the late 1920s, there's been perplexion on the specific
                    problem that Sam Mattheus and Jacques Verstraete of the
                    University of California, San Diego, finally cracked.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Many people have thought about r(4,t) – it's been an open
                    problem for over 90 years," Verstraete

                    "It really did take us years to solve. And there were many
                    times where we were stuck and wondered if we'd be able to
                    solve it at all."

                    for Ramsey theory requires us to consider how many people to
                    invite to a party so that at least three people will either
                    already be acquainted with each other or at least three
                    people will be total strangers to each other.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here, the Ramsey number, r, is the minimum number of people
                    needed at the party so that either s people know each other
                    or t people don't know each other. This can be written as
                    r(s,t), and we know the answer to r(3,3) = 6.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's a fact of nature, an absolute truth. It doesn't matter
                    what the situation is or which six people you pick – you
                    will find three people who all know each other or three
                    people who all don't know each other," Verstraete

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "You may be able to find more, but you are guaranteed that
                    there will be at least three in one clique or the other."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] After almost a year and several math obstacles, they
                    found r(4,t) is close to a cubic function of t. For a party
                    with four people who all know each other or t people who
                    don't, you need t<sup>3</sup> people.

                    [...] "One should never give up, no matter how long it
                    takes," Verstraete says. "If you find that the problem is
                    hard and you're stuck, that means it's a good problem."

                    An EV from Chinese manufacturer Nio will soon go on sale
                    with a "semi-solid state" 150kWh battery (140kWh usable)
                    that's the largest in any passenger car,
                    <a

                      ><em>Car News China</em></a
                    >
                    reported. To show [how] much range that will deliver, Nio
                    CEO William Li drove a prototype version of the
                    <a href="https://www.nio.com/et7">ET7</a> 1,044km (650
                    miles) in 14 hours, a distance surpassing many gas-powered
                    vehicles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The test was run in relatively cool temperatures (between 28
                    – 54 F) and livestreamed. Driving was done mainly in
                    semi-autonomous (or Navigate-on-Pilot+, as Nio calls it),
                    and speed-limited to 90 km/h (56 MPH). The average speed was
                    83.9 km/h (a respectable 52.4 MPH), with a travel time of
                    12.4 hours excluding stops.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The completion of this endurance challenge proves the
                    product power of the 150kWh ultra-long endurance battery
                    pack," said Li in a
                    <a href="https://weibo.com/1679013335/NxB38DRUX"
                      >Weibo post</a
                    >
                    (Google translation). "More importantly, all models on sale
                    can be flexibly upgraded to 150kWh batteries through the Nio
                    battery swap system."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In fact, the ET7's 150kWh battery will only be available on
                    a lease separate from the car, much as we've seen with some
                    cars sold in Europe. Previously, the company said that the
                    battery alone would cost as much as an entire car (the
                    company's entry-level ET5 EV), or around $42,000.
                  </p>

                    [...] Nio is a luxury EV manufacturer in China that offers
                    vehicles without a battery, letting you sign up to a
                    battery-as-a-service (BAAS) monthly subscription. That

                    A new development now puts the spotlight squarely on
                    networking device manufacturer Ubiquiti after the company
                    admitted that a misconfiguration with its cloud
                    infrastructure allowed some of its customers to watch
                    footage from strangers' security cameras.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The admission came days after some Ubiquiti customers
                    reported seeing images and videos from other people's
                    cameras through the company's Unifi Protect cloud app. One
                    of the first persons to report the bug was a Redditor
                    <a

                    to have accessed "88 consoles from another account" when
                    logging into the Unifi portal. The user had full access to
                    these devices until refreshing their browser. After that,
                    the client returned to normal, with only owned devices

                    [...] The company claims the problem happened due to an
                    upgrade to Ubiquiti's UniFi Cloud infrastructure, which it
                    has since resolved. So, customers should no longer worry
                    about their other users accessing their cameras and UniFi
                    accounts. While the company claimed the bungle affected
                    1,216 accounts in one group and 1,177 in another, supposedly
                    fewer than a dozen instances of improper access occurred. It
                    added that it would notify those customers about the breach.

                Usenet predates the Internet. Much of the Internet and, later,
                the WWW, was designed and built around Usenet discussions. That

                    If you don't actively engage with Usenet content, you don't
                    need to do anything. Current Usenet users will need to do
                    two things before February 22, 2024 if they want to continue
                    engaging with Usenet content:

                      and paid alternatives are available, both web-based and
                      application-based. To find a client, do a web search for
                      "how do I find a usenet text client"

                      client you choose will likely have a default server or a
                      set of curated options for you. If not, to find a server,

                    Because Usenet is a distributed system,
                    <strong>you do not need to migrate data</strong>. All of the
                    Usenet content you can access today on Google Groups should
                    already be synced to the new server you choose. After you

                Usenet remains a distributed, decentralized, peer-to-peer
                messaging network. The news readers contact an NNTP server in a
                client-server relation but the NNTP servers themselves
                communicated as peers. One thorn in the side for the powers
                which be is that it is essentially uncensorable. In the old days
                it was sufficient to get a floppy or two across the border to
                complete the circuit via sneakernet. One downside, sometimes
                humorous, was that propagation delays resulting from the
                distributed, decentralized nature of the peer-to-peer network
                meant that sometimes one saw a response hours or days before the
                original message showed up.

                >. Much focus is given to making and using Software Bill of
                Materials (SBOM) and incorporating them into the work flow:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    The SBOM and its contents must be validated and verified.
                    Validation assures that the SBOM data is appropriately
                    formatted and can be integrated into various tools and
                    automation. Verification ensures the content within the SBOM
                    is accurately described and all components and related
                    information on a product for licensing and exporting are
                    represented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many organizations are increasingly incorporating tools into
                    the build and source repository facility to automate this
                    process and provide artifacts which can attest to the
                    verification of the SBOM being delivered. Both the content
                    of the package, the executables, libraries and configuration
                    files, and the actual format of the SBOM, should be
                    validated. Any open-source software components should be
                    verified for license or export restrictions. In some
                    organizations, validation is performed first by the
                    developer during build/packing of the product and then by
                    the developer/supplier before customer delivery to verify
                    the integrity of the SBOM being delivered. For more
                    information on the formats and tools available for
                    validation, refer to section 5.1.5 of this document "<i
                      >SBOM Validation</i
                    >."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A good reference on guidance for the SBOM process can be
                    found in NTIA's publication "<i
                      >Software Suppliers Playbook: SBOM Production and
                      Provision</i
                    >" guidance. It is important that developers understand the
                    end-user requirements for SBOM generation and how this
                    information might be used by both suppliers and customers.
                    Additional process information relating to SBOMs and
                    acquisitions can be found in the "<i
                      >Software Consumers Playbook: SBOM Acquisition,

                    It's hard to know exactly how dire the financial situation
                    is at Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter). However, insider
                    sources recently revealed
                    <a
                      href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-12/musk-s-x-2023-ad-sales-projected-to-slump-to-about-2-5-billion"
                      >to Bloomberg</a
                    >
                    that the social media platform expects to end 2023 with
                    "roughly" $2.5 billion in advertising revenue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's "a significant slump from prior years," sources said.
                    It's also about half a billion short of the $3 billion that
                    X executives expected to make in ad sales in 2023, one
                    source said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last year, Twitter raked in more than $1 billion in ad
                    revenue per quarter, sources said. But in each of the first
                    three quarters of 2023, X only managed to generate "a little
                    more than $600 million" in ad revenue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] After Musk boosted an antisemitic post on X, he
                    apologized, but he never removed his controversial

                    Among the major brands pausing advertising on X is Disney,
                    which seems to have particularly offended Musk. He's spent
                    the past week targeting Disney CEO Bob Iger in a series of X
                    posts, calling out Disney for boycotting X. Musk appears
                    particularly frustrated that Disney is advertising on Meta
                    platforms after New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez
                    filed a lawsuit

                  <p>
                    Intel's 386 processor (1985) was an important advance in the
                    x86 architecture, not only moving to a 32-bit processor but
                    also switching to a CMOS implementation. I've been
                    reverse-engineering parts of the 386 chip and came across
                    two interesting and completely different circuits that the
                    386 uses to implement an XOR gate: one uses standard-cell
                    logic while the other uses pass-transistor logic. In this
                    article, I take a look at those circuits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Parts of the 386 were implemented with standard-cell
                    logic. The idea of standard-cell logic is to build circuitry
                    out of standardized building blocks that can be wired by a
                    computer program. In earlier processors such as the 8086,
                    each transistor was carefully positioned by hand to create a
                    chip layout that was as dense as possible. This was a
                    tedious, error-prone process since the transistors were fit
                    together like puzzle pieces. Standard-cell logic is more
                    like building with LEGO. Each gate is implemented as a
                    standardized block and the blocks are arranged in rows, as
                    shown below. The space between the rows holds the wiring
                    that connects the blocks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Some parts of the 386 implement XOR gates completely
                    differently, using pass transistor logic. The idea of pass
                    transistor logic is to use transistors as switches that pass
                    inputs through to the output, rather than using transistors
                    as switches to pull the output high or low. The pass
                    transistor XOR circuit uses 8 transistors, compared with 10
                    for the previous circuit.

                    Putting truth to the test in the "post-truth" era, Boston
                    College psychologists conducted experiments that show when
                    Americans decide whether a claim of fact should qualify as
                    true or false, they consider the intentions of the
                    information source, the team reported recently in Nature's
                    Scientific Reports.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That confidence is based on what individuals think the
                    source is trying to do – in this case either informing or
                    deceiving their audience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Even when people know precisely how accurate or inaccurate
                    a claim of fact is, whether they consider that claim to be
                    true or false hinges on the intentions they attribute to the
                    claim's information source," said Professor of Psychology
                    and Neuroscience Liane Young, an author of the report. "In
                    other words, the intentions of information sources sway
                    people's judgments about what information should qualify as
                    true."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lead author Isaac Handley-Miner, a PhD student and
                    researcher in Young's Morality Lab, said the so-called
                    post-truth era has revealed vigorous disagreement over the
                    truth of claims of fact — even for claims that are easy to
                    verify.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That disagreement has alarmed our society," said
                    Handley-Miner. "After all, it's often assumed that the
                    labels 'true' and 'false' should correspond to the objective
                    accuracy of a claim. But is objective accuracy actually the
                    only criterion people consider when deciding what should
                    qualify as true or false? Or, even when people know how
                    objectively accurate a given claim of fact is, might they be
                    sensitive to features of the social context—such as the
                    intentions of the information source? We set out to test
                    whether the intentions of information sources affect whether
                    people consider a claim of fact to be true or false even
                    when they have access to the ground truth."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The findings suggest that, even if people have access
                    to the same set of facts, they might disagree about the
                    truth of claims if they attribute discrepant intentions to
                    information sources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results demonstrated that people are not merely
                    sensitive to the objective accuracy of claims of fact when
                    classifying them as true or false. While this study focused
                    on the intent of the information source, Young and
                    Handley-Miner say intent is probably not the only other
                    feature people use to evaluate truth.

                    6-10 minutes and can detect the take-off of birds up to 80
                    km in radius. Sampling the nightly take-off patterns gives
                    us the spatial details of the daily stopover habitat use of
                    those transient migrants."

                    The fast-growing field of radar ornithology provides an
                    invaluable peek at the secret lives of migratory birds at an
                    unprecedented scale. David Wilcove, a C-PREE faculty member
                    and co-author of the paper, explains the importance.

                    The federal government is working to speed things along with
                    an injection of cash through Project NextGen, a $5 billion
                    effort to usher new and improved covid vaccines to market.
                    In October, the Department of Health and Human Services

                      href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/10/13/project-nextgen-selects-initial-vaccine-candidates-awards-over-500-million-advance-development-vaccines-therapeutics.html"
                      >announced that nearly $20 million would go to two
                      companies</a
                    >
                    developing mucosal vaccines—Codagenix and CastleVax. That
                    money will help the companies gear up for studies to test
                    how well their vaccines work to prevent symptomatic
                    infections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Codagenix's candidate, a nasal vaccine called CoviLiv, is
                    already part of a phase 3 global efficacy trial coordinated
                    by the World Health Organization. And in October, the
                    company reported results from a safety study in adults in
                    the UK who had never been vaccinated for covid before. The
                    nasal mist prompted robust immunity, at least as measured by
                    markers in the blood. But evidence of an immune response in
                    the blood doesn't necessarily indicate an immune response in
                    the mucosal lining of the airways. Or,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)01427-7/fulltext"
                      >as one physician puts it</a
                    >, "just like the 'far, dark side of the Moon', which is
                    invisible from the earth, the mucosal response to pathogens
                    is a far, dark side of immunity that is poorly or not
                    visible from the peripheral blood and more complicated to
                    probe than systemic immunity."
                  </p>

                    TBD. Different groups are trying a variety of strategies.
                    The goal is to induce immunity in the airways that is
                    robust, broad, and durable. But which strategy will succeed
                    is a bit of a question mark at the moment. Mucosal vaccines
                    fall into a few categories depending on how they're
                    administered and the platform they use. Some are sprays that
                    are squirted into the nose (CovLiv, for example). Others are
                    meant to be inhaled into the lungs (such as one developed by
                    CanSinBIO in China).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes these two routes of administration get lumped
                    together, but they actually are very different, says
                    Mangalakumari Jeyanathan, a researcher at McMaster
                    University and coauthor of
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03557-7"
                      >an editorial</a
                    >
                    that accompanies the new inhalable-vaccine paper. With a
                    nasal vaccine, the contents go into the nasal cavity. But
                    Jeyanathan thinks inhaled vaccines, which go deep into the
                    lungs, are likely to work better. Her team's research
                    suggests that nasal vaccines induce immune responses only in
                    the upper respiratory tract, not in the lower respiratory
                    tract. That means, she says, that if the vaccine doesn't
                    prevent infection, the lungs are still vulnerable, and "we
                    really need the immune responses to prevent any sort of
                    serious damage to the lung."

                        Use the original versions of Mickey and Minnie Mouse
                        from 1928, without copyrightable elements of later
                        iterations (though not every later iteration will be
                        copyrightable, as I explain below) and

                        Do not confuse consumers into thinking that your
                        creation is produced or sponsored by Disney as a matter
                        of trademark law. One way to help ensure that your
                        audience is not confused is to make the actual source of
                        the work – you or your company – clear on the title
                        screen or cover, along with a prominent disclaimer
                        indicating that your work was not produced, endorsed,
                        licensed, or approved by Disney.

                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    So, is January 1, 2024 doomsday for Disney? No. Disney still
                    retains copyright over newer iterations of Mickey such as
                    the “Sorcerer’s Apprentice” Mickey from
                    <em>Fantasia</em> (1940) as well as trademarks over Mickey
                    as a brand identifier. People will still go to its theme
                    parks, pay to see its movies, buy its merchandise. Its brand
                    identity will remain intact.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In sum, yes, you can use Mickey in new creative works. There
                    are some more complex peripheral legal issues, but here is
                    your guide through them.

                    is set to appeal before the year is out. Unless that

                    contracts. This is a play right out of Silicon Valley's

                    While you won't find the Core Ultra chips in the most
                    powerful gaming laptops, the addition of Intel Arc graphics
                    should make them slightly more viable for less demanding
                    gaming (or at least more on par with AMD's 7000 series
                    chips). Intel says the Ultra 7 165H can play
                    <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> twice as fast as the Core i7 1370P
                    in 1080p with medium graphics settings, and it can handle
                    <em>Resident Evil Village</em> 95 percent faster than that
                    older Intel chip.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] What's truly exciting about the Core Ultra hardware,
                    as well as AMD's upcoming Ryzen 8040 series, is the
                    potential for NPUs to make our computing lives slightly
                    easier. They could help eke out more battery life while
                    editing audio in Audacity on the go, or give you a slightly
                    sleeker background blur during Zoom calls.

                    To test this, the researchers explored whether introgressed
                    genetic variants—variants that moved from Neanderthals into
                    modern humans—have associations with the preferences of the
                    body for wakefulness and sleep in large cohort of several
                    hundred thousand people from the UK Biobank.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found many introgressed variants with effects on sleep
                    preference, and most strikingly, they found that these
                    variants consistently increase "morningness," the propensity
                    to wake up early. This suggests a directional effect on the
                    trait and is consistent with adaptations to high latitude
                    observed in other animals.

                    ruling dates, but Furman concluded that the cases are fake.

                    Assuming he can't turn up those cases, Schwartz must also

                    The key to a nation's long-run prosperity is increased
                    productivity. If workers can produce more in an hour, day,
                    or week then they can collectively work less or enjoy more
                    of the fruits of their labor: More pickleball courts and
                    more time to play pickleball.

                    With all the astonishing improvements that we see on our
                    computers and smartphones, it might seem that productivity
                    is about to explode, that our concern will soon be how to
                    distribute income and manage leisure when machines do all
                    the work that people used to do. The reality is the
                    opposite. The annual rate of increase of productivity in the
                    United States averaged nearly 3% between 1870 and 1970 but
                    has since slowed to less than 1%, according to data from the
                    Bureau of Labor Statistics. That 2-percentage-point drop
                    isn't much in the short run, but it is everything in the
                    long run. If productivity continues to increase at 1% annual
                    rate instead of 3%, workers will produce a third less output
                    in 20 years, 50% less in 35 years.

                    On Wednesday, news quickly spread on social media about a
                    new enabled-by-default Dropbox setting that shares Dropbox
                    data with OpenAI for an experimental AI-powered search
                    feature, but Dropbox says data is only shared if the feature
                    is actively being used. Dropbox says that user data shared
                    with third-party AI partners isn't used to train AI models
                    and is deleted within 30 days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even with assurances of data privacy laid out by Dropbox on
                    an

                      >AI privacy FAQ page</a
                    >, the discovery that the setting had been enabled by
                    default upset some Dropbox users. The setting was first
                    noticed by writer
                    <a
                      href="https://bsky.app/profile/authorwinifred.bsky.social/post/3kgemufi2yj2o"

                  <p>
                    [...] In a statement to Ars Technica, a Dropbox
                    representative said, "The third-party AI toggle is only
                    turned on to give all eligible customers the opportunity to
                    view our new AI features and functionality, like Dropbox AI.
                    It does not enable customers to use these features without
                    notice. Any features that use third-party AI offer
                    disclosure of third-party use, and link to settings that
                    they can manage. Only after a customer sees the third-party
                    AI transparency banner and chooses to proceed with asking a
                    question about a file, will that file be sent to a
                    third-party to generate answers. Our customers are still in
                    control of when and how they use these features."

                    One important tool in this work is the LLL algorithm, named

                    in 1982 — Arjen Lenstra, Hendrik Lenstra Jr. and László
                    Lovász. LLL, along with its many descendants, can break
                    cryptographic schemes in some cases; studying how they
                    behave helps researchers design systems that are less
                    vulnerable to attack. And the algorithm's talents stretch
                    beyond cryptography: It's also a useful tool in advanced
                    mathematical arenas such as computational number theory.

                  <p>
                    Over the years, researchers have honed variants of LLL to
                    make the approach more practical — but only up to a point.
                    Now, a pair of cryptographers have built a new LLL-style
                    algorithm with a significant boost in efficiency. The new
                    technique, which won the

                    pose a threat to such systems, since taking them down
                    requires finding shorter vectors than these algorithms can
                    achieve. But the best attacks researchers know of use an
                    LLL-style algorithm as a "basic building block," said

                    researchers may be able to expand the range of experiments

                    Netflix, the streaming service that has been long criticized
                    for a lack of transparency about how shows and films perform
                    on its platform, will begin publishing a “comprehensive deep
                    dive” into what its subscribers are watching twice a year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Its first report, released on Tuesday, provided viewer data
                    on more than 18,000 titles, representing a total of nearly
                    100 billion hours viewed, Netflix said. The Night Agent, a
                    political thriller, was the most watched show on Netflix
                    globally in the first half of 2023, with 812 million hours.

                    to be that transparent because we were building a new
                    business and we needed room to learn. But we also didn’t
                    want to provide road maps to future competitors.”

                    Scientists fed fruit flies a diet to make them extra plump.
                    In their old age, the researchers put them on a diet and
                    found remarkable results. If the findings transfer to
                    humans, it might mean we can improve our health at any age
                    by cutting calories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While fruit flies might not seem like the closest human
                    relatives, the diminutive insects actually share about 75%
                    of our DNA, so they are frequently used in scientific
                    studies. They also share a fair amount of the same metabolic
                    pathways as humans, so studies relating to diet can be
                    particularly useful for findings that might apply to human
                    health.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For this go around, researchers at the University of
                    Connecticut School of Medicine put a batch of male fruit
                    flies on a high calorie diet to cause them to become obese.
                    They also restricted the calorie intake of a different group
                    of flies. The calorie-restricted flies were able to live to
                    a maximum of 120 days, which is relatively old for the
                    flies. The fat flies on the high-calorie diet only lived, on
                    average, less than 80 days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But what really surprised the researchers is that switching
                    diets, even later in life, was able to extend the flies'
                    lifespans. When young flies were switched from a
                    high-calorie to a low-calorie diet at 20 days, they lived
                    almost as long as the flies that had spent their whole lives
                    eating less. Even more notably, when the fat flies were
                    switched to a low-calorie diet at 50 or 60 days – a point at
                    which most of their plump cohorts had already died – the
                    researchers saw extended lifespans and improved metabolisms.

                    Google is about to launch its grand plan to block
                    third-party cookies in Chrome that many websites use to
                    track your activity across the web for profit.

                    Starting on January 4th, Google will start testing its new
                    Tracking Protection feature that will eventually restrict
                    website access to third-party cookies by default. It will
                    come to a very small subset of Chrome users at the start,
                    specifically to one percent of users globally. Afterward,
                    Google plans to phase out the use of third-party cookies for
                    all users in the second half of 2024.

                    take more stone-walled approaches to block cross-site

                    that in mind, Google says it’s hedging that H2 2024 target
                    for turning the feature on globally in case it needs time to
                    address “any remaining competition concerns.”

                    NASA's veteran Voyager 1 spacecraft has stopped transmitting
                    engineering and science data back to Earth.

                    appears to be with the Flight Data System (FDS), which is
                    not communicating correctly with one of the probe's
                    subsystems - the Telemetry Modulation Unit (TMU).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rather than useful data, the TMU is simply transmitting a
                    repeating pattern of ones and zeroes as if it were "stuck,"
                    according to NASA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The FDS is responsible for collecting data from Voyager 1's
                    science instruments as well as on the general health of the
                    spacecraft. This is all packaged up and sent back to Earth
                    by the TMU. Having worked through the possibilities, the
                    Voyager team reckons the issue lies with the FDS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This past weekend the team tried to restart the FDS and
                    return it to the state it was in before the issue began, but
                    the spacecraft still isn't returning useable [<i>sic</i>]
                    data," NASA says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Engineers face multiple challenges. First, the Voyagers are
                    famously old – dealing with their quirks involves poring
                    through decades-old documents. Commands sent to the probes
                    must be meticulously verified to prevent unintended
                    consequences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And then there is the sheer amount of time it takes to
                    communicate with the Voyagers. A command from mission
                    control on Earth will take more than 22 hours to reach
                    Voyager 1. It can, therefore, take 45 hours to determine
                    whether a given instruction worked as expected.
                  </p>

                    NASA reckons it will be several weeks of work for engineers
                    to devise a new plan to deal with the problem.

                    that resulted in garbled data on the probe's attitude being
                    sent back to Earth. That issue was resolved by switching to
                    a different computer. However, in that instance, Voyager 1
                    continued returning science data. The latest problem has
                    stopped that.

                    The next time you find yourself having to diagnose and fix a
                    problem remotely, remember that it could always be worse,
                    even if sometimes it feels as though that misbehaving server
                    is also 15 billion(*) miles away.

                Given the limit imposed by the speed of light, a signal sent to
                Voyager 1 and immediately returned takes more than 16.6 hours.
                That's more than 2/3 of a *day*!

                    The 2nd Circuit panel ruling dismissed Musk's argument that
                    the settlement is a "prior restraint" on his speech, writing
                    that "Parties entering into consent decrees may voluntarily
                    waive their First Amendment and other rights." The judges
                    also saw "no evidence to support Musk's contention that the
                    SEC has used the consent decree to conduct bad-faith,
                    harassing investigations of his protected speech."

                  <p>
                    There is no guarantee that the Supreme Court will take up
                    Musk's case. Musk's petition says the case presents the
                    constitutional question of whether "a party's acceptance of
                    a benefit prevents that party from contending that the
                    government violated the unconstitutional conditions doctrine
                    in requiring a waiver of constitutional rights in exchange
                    for that benefit."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Musk argues that his settlement violates the
                    unconstitutional conditions doctrine, which "limits the
                    government's ability to condition benefits on the
                    relinquishment of constitutional rights." He says his case
                    also presents the question of "whether the government can
                    insulate its demands that settling defendants waive
                    constitutional rights from judicial scrutiny."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This petition presents an apt opportunity for the Court to
                    clarify that government settlements are not immune from
                    constitutional scrutiny, to the immediate benefit of the
                    hundreds of defendants who settle cases with the SEC each
                    year," Musk's petition said.

                    One day he heard from colleagues about a vocational
                    schoolteacher berating a crying student at the plant.
                    Assembly-line managers didn't discipline the students
                    directly, instead complaining to the teachers. This
                    instructor had been yelling and pulling the boy by the ear.
                    Tang thought of his own young son, about to start primary
                    school. What if his teachers treated him like that? I
                    wouldn't accept it. I couldn't accept it, Tang thought. In
                    the spring of 2019, assuming he understood the possible
                    consequences, he decided to speak out.

                    Few people have seen their handiwork influence the world
                    more than Bill Mensch. He helped create the legendary 8-bit
                    6502 microprocessor, launched in 1975, which was the heart
                    of groundbreaking systems including the Atari 2600,Apple II,
                    and Commodore 64. Mensch also created the VIA 65C22
                    input/output chip—noted for its rich features and which was
                    crucial to the 6502's overall popularity—and the
                    second-generation 65C816, a 16-bit processor that powered
                    machines such as the Apple IIGS, and theSuper Nintendo

                    The Great Wall of China used to be much greater. What stands
                    today is only a fraction of the expansive fortifications
                    built on the country's northern borders starting more than
                    2000 years ago and then eroded by time. But many sections of
                    the remaining walls seem to be getting preservation help
                    from an unlikely source: thin layers of bacteria, moss,
                    lichen, and other organisms known as biocrusts, which grow
                    on the surface of soils.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A study published today in Science Advances finds that these
                    so-called "living skins"
                    <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk5892"
                      >have likely protected parts of the Great Wall</a
                    >
                    from wind, rain, and other corrosive forces. And with
                    advances in technology and research, scientists might
                    eventually propagate new biocrusts to spare the wall from
                    further degradation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The work is "innovative and creative," says Nichole Barger,
                    an ecologist at the Nature Conservancy who was not involved
                    in the new research. She notes it's not necessarily
                    surprising, however, given the growing recognition of the
                    protective effects of biocrusts: These webs of growth are
                    known to help stabilize dryland ecosystems and prevent soil
                    erosion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of the Great Wall's most well-known and visited
                    sections are made of stone or brick, but other parts were
                    built out of soil compacted by workers, often called rammed
                    earth. Over time, this material can break down as rain seeps
                    in, wind blows the soil away, salt crystals form inside, and
                    temperatures fluctuate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But this compacted soil, much like the natural soils
                    surrounding it, can also become home to biocrusts. These
                    layers of growth have been estimated to cover some 12% of
                    the planet's land surface, and are concentrated in regions
                    with drier climates, including northern China. They come in
                    a variety of forms, from thin networks of bacteria mere
                    millimeters thick to denser layers of moss and lichen up to
                    a few centimeters in height.<br />...<br />The researchers
                    suggest these properties and others linked to biocrusts
                    protect the Great Wall from degradation in a few ways,
                    including by reducing wind erosion, preventing water and
                    salt from seeping in, and increasing the overall stability
                    of the rammed earth. Perhaps unsurprisingly, thicker,
                    moss-dominated biocrusts were generally more protective than
                    thinner ones dominated by cyanobacteria.

                  <p>
                    The app did, however, send a text message from a device to
                    an Apple server, and the response was used to generate an
                    encryption key pair, one for Apple and one for your device.
                    A Beeper service kept itself connected to Apple's servers to
                    notify it and you about new messages.

                    were spoofed to look like they came from a Mac Mini running
                    OS X Mountain Lion, perhaps providing Apple a means of
                    pinpointing and block them.

                    Mini, including Signal and WhatsApp messaging, and make it

                    While swimming pools are almost synonymous with California
                    today, in the 1970s, they were still relatively new to many
                    families. The widespread economic prosperity of post-World
                    War II America, combined with radical changes in urban
                    planning regulations, resulted in the construction of more
                    than 150,000 swimming pools in California during the 1960s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kidney-shaped pools were particularly trendy during this
                    period: up to 20,000 of these pools were installed per year
                    in the greater Los Angeles region, accompanying a housing
                    boom of single-family home construction. Soon, the new,
                    curved-walled swimming pools in the suburbs of LA accounted
                    for 60% of all pools in California.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the California drought took hold in the 1970s, many of
                    these kidney-shaped pools were empty, making them ideal
                    playgrounds for freestyle skateboarders in the LA area.
                    Skateboarding had been a hobby for teens since the 1950s and
                    1960s, but in the 1970s, the freestyle scene exploded in
                    popularity. Freestyle borrowed much of its style from
                    surfing, and California was the epicentre of US surf
                    culture.

                    [...] One of the first ways AMD optimized power efficiency
                    was by desegregating compute from I/O and memory and then
                    using the best available process tech for each. The thinking
                    is that certain elements scale better with process shrinks
                    than others. This is the reason AMD's Epyc 4 CPUs use a 6nm
                    process node for I/O and a 5nm node for the compute dies.

                    [...] This approach doesn't change the fact Moore's Law is
                    slowing down. Packing more compute into a single package is
                    going to require more power, but it does help to reduce the
                    amount needed to move data around.

                    [...] Even so, hotter chips still pose a challenge with
                    regard to thermal management. As we've previously reported,
                    higher TDPs are already causing

                    for data center operators, especially those looking to
                    deploy AI infrastructure at scale.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Papermaster argues these challenges aren't insurmountable
                    and represent an opportunity with regard to next-gen thermal
                    management and datacenter infrastructure

                  <p>
                    "As they build up that datacenter, it's worth it for them to
                    invest in advanced cooling. It's worth it for them to have a
                    leading edge, new sources of renewable energy, and new
                    geographic locations that are more ideal to place these
                    datacenters," he said. "I think there's a whole new area of
                    innovation in advanced cooling, better thermal materials,
                    better heat removal systems."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And with these technologies, Papermaster expects AMD and
                    others will be able to push power targets even higher. "I
                    don't see that we're at max wattage by any means," he says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, beyond architectural, packaging and systems-level
                    improvements, Papermaster emphasizes the opportunity
                    presented by developing better software.

                    "The next frontier is getting a deeper partnership through
                    the software stack. We're already started working closely
                    with the leading edge AI practitioners… companies like
                    Microsoft, like Oracle, Lamini and what we've done with
                    Mosaic ML," he says. "Those kinds of partnerships really
                    give us insights as to what we can do optimizing with the
                    players who are providing the software solution."

                    No matter who you are, feeling threatened in your identity
                    is bad for your well-being—and your career.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like many other essentials of life, our sense of self is
                    something we often take for granted, until it's under
                    threat. When our circumstances appear at odds with who we
                    feel ourselves to be, we are pitched headlong into a
                    distressing state that scholars call "identity threat",
                    which has been the subject of research from fields as
                    disparate as marketing and political science.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But this extensive body of literature—until now—has lacked
                    something truly fundamental: a rigorous way to measure
                    identity threat that distinguishes it from related
                    constructs such as self-esteem and identity suppression.

                    [...] At the same time, Vough stresses that no two
                    individuals have exactly the same relationship to their
                    identity. Conditions that might be threatening for one
                    member of an identity grouping might be taken in stride by
                    another. Moreover, not all identity groupings are equally
                    well-understood in their responses to threat, owing to gaps
                    in the research literature. Vough hopes her identity threat
                    scale will help scholars fill in those gaps.

                    "There's a fair amount of research about gender-related
                    threat, especially in the context of STEM, as well as race.
                    But we need more knowledge about threats based on age,
                    disability, etc. When we think of diversity, we think of
                    race and gender, but diversity is so much more than that,"
                    Vough says.

                    From the information contained in Bruno's comment, it
                    appears as though the work to correct the ground systems to
                    fuel Vulcan—the first stage propellant is methane, which
                    United Launch Alliance has not worked with before—will take
                    long enough that it will preclude another fueling test ahead
                    of the rocket's late December launch window. Thus, the next
                    launch attempt will likely occur no earlier than January 8.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It has been a slow year for United Launch Alliance, which
                    dominated the US launch industry a decade ago. The company
                    is going to launch just three rockets this calendar year:
                    the classified NROL-68 mission on a Delta IV Heavy rocket in
                    June, the "Silentbarker" mission for the National
                    Reconnaissance Office on an Atlas V in September, and two
                    Project Kuiper satellites for Amazon on an Atlas V in
                    October.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That is the company's lowest total number of launches since
                    its founding in 2006, when the rocket businesses of Lockheed
                    Martin and Boeing were merged.

                    follows a decision by the Regional Court in Leipzig, in

                    From a practical perspective, Quad9 has removed the blocks
                    on all domains previously noted by Sony and documented in
                    the lower courts.

                  <p>
                    Sony Entertainment further asserted that we block the

                  <p>
                    Quad9 has no office or standing in Germany (we are a Swiss
                    entity), but due to the Lugano Convention treaty it was
                    possible for Sony to serve an injunction in Switzerland and
                    drag Quad9 into legal proceedings.

                    [...] The court has also ruled that the case cannot be taken
                    to a higher court and their decision is the final word in
                    this particular case. Sony may appeal the appeal closure via
                    a complaint against the denial of leave of appeal and then
                    would have to appeal the case itself with the German Federal
                    Court. So while there is still a possibility that this case

                    [...] So what is L4S, and how would it make my internet
                    faster?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    L4S stands for Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput,
                    and its goal is to make sure your packets spend as little
                    time needlessly waiting in line as possible by reducing the
                    need for queuing. To do this, it works on making the latency
                    feedback loop shorter; when congestion starts happening, L4S
                    means your devices find out about it almost immediately and
                    can start doing something to fix the problem. Usually, that
                    means backing off slightly on how much data they're sending.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As we covered before, our devices are constantly speeding
                    up, then slowing down, and repeating that cycle because the
                    amount of data that links in the network have to deal with
                    is constantly changing. But packets dropping isn't a great
                    signal, especially when buffers are part of the equation —
                    your device won't realize it's sending too much data until
                    it's sending <em>way</em> too much data, meaning it has to
                    clamp down hard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    L4S, however, gets rid of that lag between the problem
                    beginning and each device in the chain finding out about it.
                    That makes it easier to maintain a good amount of data
                    throughput without adding latency that increases the amount
                    of time it takes for data to be transferred.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    L4S lets the packets tell your device how well their journey
                    went
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For everyone else, I'll try to boil it down as much as I can
                    without glossing over too much. The L4S standard adds an
                    indicator to packets, which says whether they experienced
                    congestion on their journey from one device to another. If
                    they sail right on through, there's no problem, and nothing
                    happens. But if they have to wait in a queue for more than a
                    specified amount of time, they get marked as having
                    experienced congestion. That way, the devices can start
                    making adjustments immediately to keep the congestion from
                    getting worse and to potentially eliminate it altogether.
                    That keeps the data flowing as fast as it possibly can and
                    gets rid of the disruptions and mitigations that can add
                    latency with other systems.

                    Research also has shown that the retina selectively
                    accumulates lutein and zeaxanthin from the diet, forming
                    visible yellow macular pigment that enhances vision and
                    protects photoreceptors. By noninvasively measuring
                    patients' macular pigment optical density, researchers can
                    estimate the concentration of lutein and zeaxanthin in the
                    brain.

                    "Recent advances in new therapies for Alzheimer's disease
                    show exciting promise as an effective way to slow disease
                    progression," Dorey said. "I'd be thrilled if our data
                    motivated people to keep their brains in optimum condition
                    with a colorful diet with abundant carotenoids and regular
                    exercise. Available studies suggest this may also reduce
                    risk for dementia."

                    Investing.com, a Tel Aviv-based site owned by Joffre
                    Capital, is a financial news and information hub that
                    provides a mix of markets data and investing tips and
                    trends. But increasingly, the site has been relying on AI to
                    create its stories, which often appear to be thinly-veiled
                    copies of human-written stories written elsewhere.

                    Semafor in an email that he and his team noticed several
                    months ago that Investing was publishing stories similar to
                    their site's articles. FXStreet's 60-person team monitors
                    and quickly analyzes developments in global currencies. By
                    pumping out AI articles, Investing was eroding FXStreet's
                    edge, Monguió said.

                    should be balanced, proportionate and not unnecessarily
                    constrain or hinder technological development," it
                    continued. "This is of particular importance because,
                    although artificial intelligence is already present in many
                    aspects of people’s daily lives, it is not possible to
                    anticipate all possible uses or applications thereof that
                    may happen in the future."

                    Verizon Wireless gave a female victim's address and phone
                    logs to an alleged stalker who pretended to be a police
                    officer, according to an affidavit filed by an FBI special
                    agent. The man, Robert Michael Glauner, was later arrested
                    near the victim's home and found to be carrying a knife at
                    the time, according to the affidavit submitted in court
                    yesterday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Glauner allegedly traveled from New Mexico to Raleigh, North
                    Carolina, after finding out where she lived and, before
                    arriving, sent a threatening message that said, "if I can't
                    have you no one can." He also allegedly threatened to send
                    nude photos of the victim to her family members.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Glauner and the victim met in August or September 2023
                    on xhamster.com, a porn website with dating features, and
                    "had an online romantic relationship," the affidavit said.
                    The victim ended the relationship, but Glauner "continued to
                    contact or try to contact" her, the document said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Glauner tricked Verizon into providing sensitive information
                    by sending an email and fake search warrant to
                    vsat.cct@one.verizon.com, the email address for the Verizon
                    Security Assistance Team (VSAT), which handles legal
                    requests. Verizon didn't realize the request was fraudulent
                    even though it came from a Proton Mail address rather than
                    from a police department or other governmental agency,
                    according to the affidavit filed yesterday by FBI Special
                    Agent Michael Neylon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An email to Verizon from "steven1966c@proton.me" on
                    September 26, 2023, said, "Here is the pdf file for search
                    warrant. We are in need if the [<em>sic</em>] this cell
                    phone data as soon as possible to locate and apprehend this
                    suspect. We also need the full name of this Verizon
                    subscriber and the new phone number that has been assigned
                    to her. Thank you."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The email's attached document contained a fake affidavit
                    written by "Detective Steven Cooper" of the Cary, North
                    Carolina Police Department. The Cary Police Department
                    confirmed that no officer named Steven Cooper is employed by
                    their agency, Neylon wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But after reviewing the email and document sent by
                    "Cooper," Verizon provided an address and phone logs. "On
                    October 5, 2023, Verizon Wireless provided Victim 1's phone
                    records, including address and phone logs, to Glauner,"
                    according to Neylon's affidavit.

                    When a material exists as an ultrathin layer—a mere one or a
                    few atoms thick—it has totally different properties from
                    thicker samples of the same material. That's because
                    confining electrons to a 2D plane gives rise to exotic
                    states. Because of their flat dimensions and their broad
                    compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies, such
                    2D materials are promising for harnessing new phenomenon in
                    electronic devices.

                    These states include quantum spin Hall insulators, which
                    conduct electricity along their edges but are electrically
                    insulating in their interiors. Such systems when coupled
                    with superconductivity have been proposed as a route toward
                    engineering topological superconducting states that have
                    potential application in future topological quantum
                    computers.

                  <p>
                    Now, Michael Randle at the RIKEN Advanced Device Laboratory,
                    along with co-workers from RIKEN and Fujitsu, have created a
                    2D Josephson junction with active components entirely from a
                    material known to be a quantum spin Hall insulator. The work
                    is published in the journal Advanced Materials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Josephson junction is generally made by sandwiching a
                    material between two elemental superconductors. In contrast,
                    Randle and team fabricated their device from a single
                    crystal of monolayer 2D tungsten telluride, which had
                    previously been shown to exhibit both a superconducting
                    state and a quantum spin Hall insulator one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We fabricated the junction entirely from monolayer tungsten
                    telluride," says Randle. "We did this by exploiting its
                    ability to be tuned into and out of the superconducting
                    state using electrostatic gating."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The next step involves the implementation of
                    ultraflat pre-patterned gate structures by using, for
                    example, chemical–mechanical polishing," explains Randle.
                    "If this is achieved, we hope to form Josephson junctions
                    with precisely tailored geometries and to use our
                    cutting-edge microwave resonator experiment techniques to
                    observe and investigate the exciting topological nature of
                    the devices."

                    A series of attacks against Microsoft Active Directory
                    domains could allow miscreants to spoof DNS records,
                    compromise Active Directory and steal all the secrets it
                    stores, according to Akamai security researchers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We're told the attacks - which are usable against servers
                    running the default configuration of Microsoft Dynamic Host
                    Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers - don't require any
                    credentials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Akamai says it reported the issues to Redmond, which isn't
                    planning to fix the issue. Microsoft did not respond to
                    <em>The Register</em>'s inquiries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] DHCP is a commonly used network management protocol,
                    and Microsoft's DHCP server is widely used in corporate
                    networks. Organizations can create DNS record using a DHCP
                    feature called DHCP DNS Dynamic Updates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Whenever a client is given an IP address by the DHCP
                    server, the latter can contact the DNS server and update the
                    client's DNS record," Akamai's Ori David explained.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the DHCP server registers or modifies a DNS record on
                    behalf of its clients, it uses DNS Dynamic Updates — and
                    therein lies the problem. DHCP DNS Dynamic Updates does not
                    require any authentication by the DHCP client, and Microsoft
                    DHCP servers enable DHCP DNS Dynamic Updates by default.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "So an attacker can essentially use the DHCP server to
                    authenticate to the DNS server on behalf of themself," David
                    said. "This grants the attacker access to the ADIDNS zone
                    without any credentials."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In addition to creating non-existent DNS records,
                    unauthenticated attackers can also use the DHCP server to
                    overwrite existing data, including DNS records inside the
                    ADI zone in instances where the DHCP server is installed on
                    a domain controller, which David says is the case in 57
                    percent of the networks Akamai monitors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
