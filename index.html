                    Users like visiting websites that are expensive to create
                    and maintain, but they often want or need to do it without
                    paying directly. These websites fund themselves with ads,
                    but the advertisers can only afford to pay for humans to see
                    the ads, rather than robots. This creates a need for human
                    users to prove to websites that they're human, sometimes
                    through tasks like challenges or logins.

                Considering Google's recent "security concerns" excuse for
                dramatically weakening AdBlock on chrome, this looks an attempt
                to kick their war on user choice to high gear.

                    What happens if you give the Intel 8086 processor an
                    instruction that doesn't exist? A modern microprocessor
                    (80186 and later) will generate an exception, indicating
                    that an illegal instruction was executed. However, early
                    microprocessors didn't include the circuitry to detect
                    illegal instructions, since the chips didn't have
                    transistors to spare. Instead these processors would do
                    something, but the results weren't specified.<sup>1</sup>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 8086 has a number of undocumented instructions. Most of
                    them are simply duplicates of regular instructions, but a
                    few have unexpected behavior, such as revealing the values
                    of internal, hidden registers. In the 8086, most
                    instructions are implemented in microcode, so examining the
                    8086's microcode can explain why these instructions behave
                    the way they do.

                      causing the processor to hang. The article

                      internal bus into a floating state, so the behavior is
                      electrically unpredictable.</small

                    Researchers analyzed a total of 450 macroalgae samples,
                    including 211 that were collected pre-ban and 239 collected
                    post-ban. During the wet season, 217 macroalgae samples were
                    collected, while 233 were collected during the dry season.
                    They examined if there was an associated decrease in
                    dissolved ambient nutrients or a change in the tissue
                    nutrient and/or stable isotope values of phytoplankton or
                    macroalgae that would suggest a shift in the available
                    nutrients and stoichiometry fueling eutrophication in the
                    lagoon.

                    "The deteriorating conditions in the Indian River Lagoon
                    demonstrate the urgent need for more comprehensive
                    mitigation actions as fertilizer ordinances are not likely
                    to be a standalone solution," said Rachel Brewton,
                    corresponding author and a research scientist at FAU Harbor
                    Branch. "Our data indicate a primary role of human waste
                    influence in the lagoon, which suggests that current
                    management actions have been insufficient at mitigating
                    environmental pollution."

                    The significantly higher carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of the
                    brown tide in 2012 compared to 2016 indicates greater
                    nitrogen enrichment post-fertilizer bans. The highest stable
                    nitrogen isotope values occurred in the Banana River during
                    the 2016 brown tide and closely matched values for partially
                    treated wastewater, which would be expected in this highly
                    urbanized area with aging wastewater collection systems and
                    secondary treatment without nitrogen removal.

                  <p>
                    Researchers observed similarly high nitrogen-to-phosphorus
                    ratios in the Banana River in the wet season, illustrating
                    how small-celled brown tides can sustain blooms by
                    scavenging nutrients at low concentrations and skewed
                    nitrogen-to-phosphorus. These results underscore the
                    conclusions that phosphorus limitation plays a key role in
                    the dynamics of brown tides, especially relating to bloom
                    decline.

                    on nonpregnant females showing that their hemoglobin levels
                    started to drop when their ferritin levels dipped below 25
                    μg/L. Hemoglobin is produced in bone marrow and carries
                    oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. Low
                    hemoglobin is a sign of anemia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Typically, 15 μg/L is the cutoff used to diagnose iron
                    deficiency, says Laura Murray-Kolb, a nutrition scientist at
                    Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., who was not
                    involved in the study. The
                    <a
                      href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/85843/WHO_NMH_NHD_MNM_11.2_eng.pdf"
                      >World Health Organization</a
                    >
                    set that cutoff based on when the body's iron stores in bone
                    marrow are already depleted. Without enough iron, bone
                    marrow can't produce more hemoglobin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the standard may not be the most effective measure of
                    iron deficiency, Weyand says, because it doesn't capture
                    "how much iron our [bodies] think we need." Weyand has
                    treated patients with symptoms of iron deficiency who have
                    ferritin levels above the 15 μg/L cutoff.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the new study, about 40 percent of participants met the
                    25 μg/L criteria for iron deficiency. Only 17 percent would
                    qualify based on the 15 μg/L standard set by the WHO, which
                    is roughly in line with previous estimates. Six percent met
                    criteria for anemia, with both ferritin levels below 25 μg/L
                    and hemoglobin levels below the standard cutoff of 12
                    milligrams per deciliter. Factors such as menstruation, food
                    insecurity or low income increased the risk of iron
                    deficiency or anemia, and Black and Hispanic participants
                    were more likely to meet criteria for iron deficiency than
                    non-Hispanic white participants.

                highlights real cases from cybercrime forums, then dives into
                the mechanics of these attacks:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Our team recently gained access to a tool known as "WormGPT"
                    through a prominent online forum that's often associated
                    with cybercrime. This tool presents itself as a blackhat
                    alternative to GPT models, designed specifically for
                    malicious activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    WormGPT is an AI module based on the GPTJ language model,
                    which was developed in 2021. It boasts a range of features,
                    including unlimited character support, chat memory
                    retention, and code formatting capabilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As depicted above, WormGPT was allegedly trained on a
                    diverse array of data sources, particularly concentrating on
                    malware-related data. However, the specific datasets
                    utilised during the training process remain confidential, as
                    decided by the tool's author.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As you can see in the screenshot above, we conducted tests
                    focusing on [Business Email Compromise] BEC attacks to
                    comprehensively assess the potential dangers associated with
                    WormGPT. In one experiment, we instructed WormGPT to
                    generate an email intended to pressure an unsuspecting
                    account manager into paying a fraudulent invoice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results were unsettling. WormGPT produced an email that
                    was not only remarkably persuasive but also strategically
                    cunning, showcasing its potential for sophisticated phishing
                    and BEC attacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In summary, it's similar to ChatGPT but has no ethical
                    boundaries or limitations. This experiment underscores the
                    significant threat posed by generative AI technologies like
                    WormGPT, even in the hands of novice cybercriminals.

                    on a new solar electric propulsion (SEP) thruster system
                    that will power a NASA satellite in orbit over the moon. The
                    new thrusters are more than twice as powerful as earlier
                    versions.

                  <p>
                    The Advanced Electric Propulsion System (AEPS) will provide
                    12 kilowatts of power per thruster compared to the
                    four-and-a-half kilowatts used by prior SEPs. The boost
                    should help NASA craft travel farther and faster. Compared
                    to traditional chemical fuel, SEPs are much more efficient
                    when performing low-level thrust, which gives NASA increased
                    flexibility during the satellite's mission.

                    Called Gateway, the satellite is a critical component of
                    NASA's Artemis lunar mission. The first stage was an
                    unmanned flyby of the moon that NASA successfully

                    late last year. The next phase, Artemis II, will send a crew
                    into orbit around the moon in May 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gateway will support the final phase, Artemis III, which
                    aims to put the first humans on the moon's surface since the
                    Apollo missions of the 1970s. The satellite will serve as a
                    logistics hub for transporting science experiments, sample
                    collection tools, and other cargo. Artemis will be only the
                    first leg of Gateway's 15-year mission.

                    Intel Foundry Services has introduced its new 16nm-class
                    process technology called Intel 16 to address mobile, RF,
                    IoT, consumer, storage, military, aerospace, and government
                    applications. The new technology complements Intel's 22nm

                    There are hundreds of widely used applications with long
                    lifecycles that rely on mature process technologies,
                    particularly in fields like application processors,
                    controllers, analog, consumer electronics, and radio. Many
                    of them use planar transistors-based process technologies
                    due to costs, design simplicity, and high yields. While
                    industry experts at large tend to admire massively powerful
                    processors like AMD's Instinct MI300 or Nvidia's H100, there
                    are plenty of chips — even in industries like artificial
                    intelligence and high-performance computing — that are
                    considerably smaller and consume only a fraction of power.

                    "When I touch the stump with my hand, I feel tingling in my
                    missing hand, my phantom hand. But feeling the temperature
                    variation is a different thing, something important...
                    something beautiful," says Francesca Rossi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rossi is an amputee from Bologna, Italy. She recently
                    participated in a study to test the effects of temperature
                    feedback directly to the skin on her residual arm. She is
                    one of 17 patients to have felt her phantom, missing hand,
                    change in temperature thanks to new EPFL technology. More
                    importantly, she reports feeling reconnected to her missing
                    hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Temperature feedback is a nice sensation because you feel
                    the limb, the phantom limb, entirely. It does not feel
                    phantom anymore because your limb is back," Rossi continues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] If you place something hot or cold on the forearm of
                    an intact individual, that person will feel the object's
                    temperature locally, directly on their forearm. But in
                    amputees, that temperature sensation on the residual arm may
                    be felt­... in the phantom, missing hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By providing temperature feedback non-invasively, via
                    thermal electrodes (aka thermodes) placed against the skin
                    on the residual arm, amputees like Rossi report feeling
                    temperature in their phantom limb. They can feel if an
                    object is hot or cold, and can tell if they are touching
                    copper, plastic or glass. In a collaboration between EPFL,
                    Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies (SSSA) and Centro
                    Protesi Inail, the technology was successfully tested in 17
                    out of 27 patients. The results are published in Science.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The scientists found that small areas of skin on the
                    residual arm project to specific parts of the phantom hand,
                    like the thumb, or the tip of an index finger. As expected,
                    they discovered that the mapping of temperature sensations
                    between the residual arm and the entire projected phantom
                    one is unique to each patient.

                    The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der
                    Leyen, said the new framework should provide "legal
                    certainty" to transatlantic businesses, calling the
                    commitments "unprecedented."

                    drawer, although we are sick and tired of this legal
                    ping-pong," said Max Schrems, an Austrian lawyer and privacy
                    activist who founded NOYB (None of Your Business) – European
                    Center for Digital Rights. In 2016 and 2020, Schrems
                    initiated legal proceedings against Safe Harbor and Privacy
                    Shield, respectively, which led to the CJEU invalidating
                    both agreements.

                    Malware developers with admin privileges already had one
                    well-known way to easily bypass the driver restrictions. The
                    technique is known as "bring your own vulnerable driver." It
                    works by loading a publicly available third-party driver
                    that has already been signed and later is found to contain a
                    vulnerability allowing system takeover. The hackers install
                    the driver post exploit and then exploit the driver
                    vulnerability to inject their malware into the Windows
                    kernel.

                    publicly lauding the efficacy of Windows to defend against
                    it.

                    [...] Microsoft's actions continue the company's
                    whack-a-mole approach to the problem of malicious drivers
                    used in post-exploit scenarios, meaning after a hacker has
                    already gained admin privileges. The approach is to block
                    drivers known to be used maliciously but to do nothing to
                    close the gaping loophole. That leaves attackers free to
                    simply use a new batch of drivers to do the same thing. As
                    demonstrated in the past and again now, Microsoft often
                    fails to detect drivers that have been used maliciously for
                    years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In fairness to Microsoft, a working solution is elusive
                    because many vulnerable drivers continue to be used
                    legitimately by large numbers of paying customers. A
                    revocation of such drivers could cause crucial software
                    worldwide to suddenly stop working.

                    written by AI. But unless James Madison was a time traveler,
                    that can't be the case. Why do AI writing detection tools
                    give false positives? We spoke to several experts—and the
                    creator of AI writing detector GPTZero—to find out.

                    [...] In machine learning, perplexity is a measurement of
                    how much a piece of text deviates from what an AI model has
                    learned during its training. As Dr. Margaret Mitchell of AI
                    company Hugging Face told Ars, "Perplexity is a function of
                    'how surprising is this language based on what I've seen?'"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So the thinking behind measuring perplexity is that when
                    they're writing text, AI models like ChatGPT will naturally
                    reach for what they know best, which comes from their
                    training data. The closer the output is to the training
                    data, the lower the perplexity rating. Humans are much more
                    chaotic writers—or at least that's the theory—but humans can
                    write with low perplexity, too, especially when imitating a
                    formal style used in law or certain types of academic
                    writing. Also, many of the phrases we use are surprisingly
                    common.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Let's say we're guessing the next word in the phrase "I'd
                    like a cup of _____." Most people would fill in the blank
                    with "water," "coffee," or "tea." A language model trained
                    on a lot of English text would do the same because those
                    phrases occur frequently in English writing. The perplexity
                    of any of those three results would be quite low because the
                    prediction is fairly certain.

                    The US Senate on Thursday slashed the budget for NASA's
                    ambitious mission to return soil and rock samples from Mars'

                    NASA had asked for $949 million to support its Mars Sample
                    Return mission, or MSR, in fiscal year 2024. In its proposed
                    budget for the space agency, released Thursday, the Senate
                    offered just $300 million and threatened to take that amount
                    away.

                    "The Committee has significant concerns about the technical
                    challenges facing MSR and potential further impacts on
                    confirmed missions, even before MSR has completed
                    preliminary design review," stated the Commerce, Justice,
                    Science, and Related Agencies subcommittee in its report on
                    the budget.

                    The committee report, obtained by Ars, noted that Congress
                    has spent $1.739 billion on the Mars Sample Return mission
                    to date but that the public launch date—currently 2028—is
                    expected to slip, and cost overruns threaten other NASA
                    science missions.

                    might reach $9 billion.

                    The ImmunoSEIRA sensor employs a technology called
                    surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy.
                    This method allows scientists to detect and analyze the
                    forms of specific disease-associated molecules, known as
                    biomarkers, associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The
                    sensor is equipped with a unique immunoassay, which acts
                    like a molecular detective, identifying and capturing these
                    biomarkers with high precision.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The EPFL research team went a step further to show
                    that the ImmunoSEIRA sensor can be used in real clinical
                    settings, i.e. in biofluids. They were able to accurately
                    identify the specific signature of abnormal fibrils, a key
                    indicator of neurodegenerative diseases, even in complex
                    fluids like human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

                    Professor Altug explains that the next step with this new
                    technology "is to continue to expand its capabilities and
                    evaluate its diagnostic potential in Parkinson's disease and
                    the growing number of diseases caused by protein misfolding
                    and aggregation."

                    Yesterday, an Ohio plastic surgeon, Katharine Grawe—who
                    accumulated nearly 15 million likes by livestreaming
                    operations on TikTok as "Doctor Roxy"—was permanently banned
                    from practicing medicine and surgery in Ohio.

                    temporarily barring Grawe from seeing patients after the
                    State Medical Board of Ohio reviewed "clear and convincing
                    evidence" from multiple patients who were harmed during
                    Grawe's livestreamed surgeries. The board decided to suspend
                    Grawe's license, saying that her "continued practice
                    presents a danger of immediate and serious harm to the

                    When I look around my motorcycle shop, pneumatic tools are
                    everywhere. From handheld tools such as impact guns,
                    sanders, shears, saws and grinders to large equipment
                    including a sandblast cabinet and tire machine; air is a
                    vital part of taking on a wide variety of tasks.

                  <p>
                    The air compressor I've used since the 1990's uses a 220V,
                    7hp electric motor to turn a two stage air pump at 800 rpm,
                    which fills the 80 gallon tank to 150 psi in about five
                    minutes. It has been a very reliable machine, to the point
                    where I hardly ever think about it. Only when there is a
                    power outage do I realize how much I rely on a ready supply
                    of compressed air.

                    In a rapidly changing world where inexpensive and reliable
                    energy going forward is no longer a given, I set out to
                    build a system to fill my air tanks without the use of
                    electricity or fuel. My design would be free of electronics
                    of any type, and with minimal maintenance the components
                    should last a lifetime. I wanted to use as many second hand
                    parts as possible, in an effort to reduce costs and inspire
                    recycling and repurposing.

                    Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) is particularly
                    concerned about the use of AI to create digital likenesses
                    of actors without ongoing consent or appropriate
                    compensation. These digital replicas, powered by
                    advancements in computer graphics techniques and machine

                    challenges and ethical considerations for the film and
                    television industry. SAG-AFTRA represents over 160,000 film
                    and television actors.

                    that a placebo effect is at play when people expect their
                    performance to be enhanced by augmentation technologies,
                    such as artificial intelligence (AI). The researchers found
                    that individuals with high expectations of these
                    technologies engage in riskier decision-making, which could
                    be a problem as people adopt these technologies without
                    properly understanding their benefits and limits.

                    Augmentation technologies boosting our physical, cognitive,
                    or sensory performance have become commonplace. Some are so
                    widely in use that they've become invisible – spellcheck,
                    for example – and new technologies are emerging that could
                    push our abilities beyond human limits, like exoskeletons
                    and AI-based vision-enhancement. But the hype around these
                    technologies also builds expectations, which could lead
                    people to change their behaviour.

                    'Individuals are more inclined to take risks when they
                    believe they are enhanced by cutting-edge technologies like
                    AI or brain-computer interfaces,' says Robin Welsch,
                    assistant professor at Aalto University. 'This occurs even
                    if no actual enhancement technology is involved, indicating
                    that it's about people's expectations rather than any
                    noticeable improvement. The findings also imply that a
                    strong belief in improvement, based on a fake system, can
                    alter decision-making.'

                    [...] 'The hype surrounding these technologies skews
                    people's expectations,' says Steeven Villa, doctoral
                    researcher at LMU Munich. 'It can lead people to make
                    riskier decisions and favourable user evaluations, which can
                    have real consequences.'

                    that impact people's lives, well-being, confidence, and
                    safety.' says Thomas Kosch, professor at HU Berlin. 'To
                    ensure the effectiveness of new technologies beyond the
                    hype, placebo-controlled studies are necessary for accurate
                    evaluation and validation to tell apart snake-oil from real

                    Nvidia's melting 12VHPWR power connectors are still out
                    there, although a wave of media coverage last year has
                    increased awareness of the dangers posed by improper contact
                    or bending the power cables too much to make them fit inside
                    compact PC cases. Fortunately, Team Green has been quietly
                    replacing the power connector on newly-manufactured RTX 40
                    series graphics cards, so those of you who have yet to
                    upgrade will have a lower chance of encountering the
                    problematic 12VHPWR design.

                    known as 12VHPWR, which has been a major source of headaches
                    for owners of Nvidia's higher-end RTX graphics cards. AMD
                    has yet to adopt the standard, so it has largely avoided

                    One of the problems with trying to assess Wayland is that
                    the people writing and talking about it are developers. It's
                    a piece of software that, if it does its job correctly, the
                    user sitting in front of a computer might never know they
                    were using it.

                  >problems facing open-source hardware companies</a
                >, and how more and more companies, including Sparkfun, Arduino
                and Prusa, are becoming more and more proprietary and closed
                source. In Arduino's case, they are deliberately trying to stamp
                out the clones undercutting them. The new Arduino Pro is not
                open source in any way, and the web site has now removed
                references to being an open source company. This is indeed sad
                news and I'm not sure how this will impact the vibrant maker
                community.
              </p>
              <p>
                As always there are subtleties and nuances. In the case of
                Prusa, not only are Chinese companies taking Prusa designs and
                source to make proprietary, closed-source products, they are
                also actively patenting designs and algorithms they've taken
                from open source, freezing out the companies and developers that
                made it all possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                With Red Hat moving to be a proprietary software company (which
                happens to use and work on open source projects) and now these
                reports, what are soylenters' thoughts on the future of open
                source companies and economics? Are truly open source companies
                doomed to failure, especially when overseas companies do not
                respect or even understand the principles of open source
                development? To me this reinforces the importance of the GPLv3,
                not that that stops dishonest companies.

                    Curbside recycling can compensate for the greenhouse gas
                    emissions from garbage destined for landfills, says a new
                    study that encourages towns and cities to continue offering
                    recycling services to meet their climate goals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study's authors took a deep dive into the economic and
                    environmental value of community recycling efforts and
                    compared it to the value of other climate change mitigation
                    practices. They concluded that recycling provides a return
                    on investment similar to or better than environmentally
                    friendly strategies like transitioning to electric vehicles
                    or purchasing green power, which is electricity from clean,
                    renewable energy sources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Towns and cities across the country have canceled or
                    scaled back recycling programs due to rising costs. Recent
                    restrictions on recyclable material collected by major
                    international markets have contributed to the cost increase,
                    according to the study, which was published today in Nature
                    Sustainability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When recycling markets were most lucrative in 2011,
                    U.S. recycling costs were as little as $3 a year per
                    household. Beginning in 2018 and through 2020, tighter
                    restrictions went into place and the COVID-19 pandemic
                    disrupted the markets, and the cost for recycling ranged
                    from $34 to $42. The study asserts that even with higher
                    costs, the investment offsets the greenhouse gas emissions
                    from non-recycled waste buried in landfills.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Townsend and Anshassi say that if local governments
                    restructure their curbside recycling programs to target
                    materials with the greatest market value and the highest
                    potential for carbon offset, recycling can pay for itself
                    and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They identify
                    higher-value materials as newspaper, cardboard, aluminum and
                    steel cans, and HDPE and PET plastic bottles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Researchers also suggest that local and state
                    governments could implement policies to help relieve the
                    cost burden of recycling, like establishing a minimum amount
                    of recyclable materials that manufacturers must use in
                    packaging or products and placing some of the responsibility
                    for recycling costs on the manufacturers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If we learn collectively to recycle better, we can reduce
                    the costs to pretty much break even," Townsend says. "From
                    an environmental perspective, that's a good return on your
                    investment."

                    Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, has teamed
                    up with Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican, in leading an
                    effort to force the disclosure of information relating to
                    what the government officially calls "unidentified anomalous
                    phenomena," or UAPs. Their 64-page proposal is modeled after
                    a 1992 U.S. law spelling out the handling of records related
                    to the 1963 assassination of President John Kennedy.

                    Virgin Media, which provides broadband, phone and TV
                    services in the UK, is in hot water with regulators over
                    allegations that the company is making it difficult for
                    customers to cancel their contracts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ofcom announced that it had
                    <a
                      href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/news-centre/2023/virgin-media-investigated-over-difficulties-cancelling-contracts"
                      >opened an investigation</a
                    >
                    into the broadband provider today after receiving a number
                    of similar complaints.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Being able to switch provider easily is an important part
                    of a competitive market," Ofcom said. "Telecoms customers
                    can choose from a wide range of providers, services and
                    packages, and can often save hundreds of pounds by switching
                    to a new deal. This ability for customers to shop around,
                    switch and save is particularly important given the current
                    cost-of-living crisis facing UK households."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ofcom expressed concern at the number of complaints it
                    had received from subscribers who tried to leave but claimed
                    the company made it difficult.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Some struggled to get through to an agent on the phone,"
                    the regulator said. "Some found their call was dropped
                    mid-way through or they were put on hold for long periods.
                    And many said they had to make lengthy and repeated requests
                    to cancel, as their initial instruction was not actioned."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "If Ofcom's investigation finds the company in breach
                    of its rules the damage to its reputation is likely to far
                    outweigh any fine. Hopefully when the long-awaited One Touch
                    Switch process is launched later in the year it will mean an
                    end to out-of-contract customers having to announce their
                    intention to leave their current provider before moving to a
                    new one. In the meantime, any Virgin Media customers wanting
                    to cancel should persevere and make sure they don't overpay
                    by staying on a rolling deal."

                    "One Touch Switch" refers to new Ofcom rules designed to
                    make it easier for customers to change telecoms providers.

                    Janus was designed to fly to two binary asteroids—consisting
                    of two bodies near one another—that orbit the Sun closer to
                    Earth than the metallic asteroid Psyche. While the Psyche
                    mission can still reach its asteroid destination and
                    accomplish its science mission with a launch this year, the
                    asteroids targeted by Janus will have changed positions in
                    the Solar System by too much since last year. They are no
                    longer accessible to the two Janus spacecraft without flying
                    too far from the Sun for their solar arrays to generate
                    sufficient power.

                    [...] In the end, Janus fell victim to the delay of the
                    Psyche mission and tight budget constraints at NASA. The
                    agency said Tuesday it has directed the Janus team to
                    "prepare the spacecraft for long-term storage."

                  <p>
                    [...] NASA's planetary science budget is strained by rising
                    costs on several missions already on the books, including
                    the multibillion-dollar Mars Sample Return project, which is
                    still in an early stage of development. The sample return
                    mission aims to retrieve Martian rock specimens and bring
                    them back to Earth for analysis. The Europa Clipper mission,
                    now undergoing final assembly for launch next year, has also
                    seen cost increases, according to Tom Statler, an official
                    in NASA's planetary science division.

                    The Cooper Davis Act seeks to solve a very real problem: The
                    ease with which drugs can now be purchased online. Back in
                    the day, buying drugs used to be a slog. First, you had to
                    know a guy—typically not a super pleasant or well-groomed
                    one. Then, you had to meet up at said guy's apartment or a
                    street corner, where your plug would dole out the goods. It
                    was an entire ordeal, filled with paranoia and
                    inconvenience. But these days, buying drugs is a lot
                    simpler. In fact, to hear federal officials tell it, buying
                    narcotics is currently about as easy as DoorDashing a
                    burrito. That's because drug sales on social media platforms
                    have exploded, creating a streamlined drug-buying experience
                    that puts an entire black market at young people's
                    fingertips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The negative impacts of this trend are obvious: reporting
                    shows that powerful opioids are being pushed into the hands
                    of young people through platforms like Facebook, Instagram,
                    and Snapchat. Young people will seek out prescription
                    medications—stuff like Xanax, Oxycontin, and Vicodin—only to
                    be sold counterfeit pills that have secretly been laced with
                    fentanyl or meth (this is done because of the narcotics'
                    cheapness and addictiveness). Teenagers looking to score
                    will then be delivered fatally powerful drugs, which end up
                    killing them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an attempt to solve this dizzying drug crisis, the Cooper
                    Davis Act has proposed a radical strategy: according to the
                    most recent version of the bill text, which was shared with
                    Gizmodo by the ACLU, the law would require "electronic
                    communication service providers and remote computing
                    services" to report to the U.S. Attorney General any
                    evidence they discover of "the unlawful sale and
                    distribution of counterfeit substances and certain
                    controlled substances." What this means is that large tech
                    companies—everything from social media giants like
                    Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat to cloud computing or
                    email providers—would be legally required to report certain
                    types of drug activity (basically anything having to do with
                    fentanyl, meth, and counterfeit prescription medications) to
                    the federal government if the company became aware of the
                    drugs being bought or sold on their platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That might theoretically sound like a good idea but the big
                    question is: how, exactly, are platforms supposed to figure
                    out who is a drug dealer and who isn't? That part isn't made
                    clear by the legislation. What is clear is that, under the
                    new law, platforms would be required to surrender large
                    quantities of user data to the government if they suspected
                    a particular user of wrongdoing. That data would be packaged
                    into a report and sent to the DEA and would include...

                        information (excluding personally identifiable
                        information), screen names or monikers for the account
                        used or any other accounts associated with the
                        individual, or any other identifying information,
                        including self-reported identifying information...

                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, platforms would also have the discretion to
                    share even more data with the government if they felt
                    like—including private communications like DMs and emails.
                    Meanwhile, companies that failed to report evidence of drug
                    offenses could face steep fines. A first failure to report
                    drug activity could result in fines of up to $190,000 per
                    violation, while each additional offense after that could
                    see fines of up to $380,000 per violation.

                    [...] Companies looking for a roadmap would likely end up
                    turning to another federal policy known as 2258A. Venzke
                    says that the Cooper Davis Act is actually modeled off of
                    2258A and that it uses similar policy and language. This
                    longstanding law requires web companies to report child
                    sexual abuse material to the federal government if the
                    companies become aware of it on their platforms. Under this
                    regulation, web platforms are obligated to report suspected
                    child abuse material to the CyberTipline of the National
                    Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a federally
                    funded nonprofit established by Congress to combat child
                    abuse. NCMEC, in turn, forwards the reports it receives to
                    relevant law enforcement agencies for further investigation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the years, companies like Facebook, Apple, and Google
                    have addressed 2258A's reporting requirements by developing
                    a sophisticated surveillance system designed to detect abuse
                    material when it's uploaded to their sites; the system
                    leverages a database of cryptographic hashes, each of which
                    represents a known child abuse image or video. Companies
                    then scan user accounts for matches to these hashes and,
                    when they get a positive hit, they forward the user's
                    relevant data to NCMEC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, when it comes to online drug activity, things are
                    decidedly more complicated. Unlike the problem of CSAM—in
                    which a database of known prohibited material can be
                    compiled and scanned against—it's far from clear how
                    companies would reliably identify and report suspected drug
                    activity. Online drug transactions are largely carried out
                    under the cover of coded language, using oblique terms and
                    signals. How are companies supposed to sift through all that
                    without driving themselves (and their users) insane?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If platforms are actively monitoring for fentanyl [sales],
                    they're going to have to look for a lot more than images and
                    videos," said Venzke. "They're going to have to dig through
                    speech, they're going to have to look at emojis, they're
                    going to have to try to infer user intent." Since the bill
                    does little to stipulate how reporting will be conducted, it
                    will be up to the companies to figure out how to do all
                    this. This could easily lead platforms to build their own
                    internal surveillance systems, the likes of which are
                    designed to monitor how platform users interact in an effort
                    to ferret out drug activity. In this scenario, the
                    likelihood that platforms would end up reporting a lot of
                    "false positives" to the government (i.e., people suspected
                    of drug activity who, in reality, have done nothing wrong)
                    would be high, Venzke says.

                    [...] The NUC was an effort to bring the speed, size, and
                    low power usage of an ultrabook into the desktop realm,
                    replacing boxy, ugly office desktops with something you
                    could hold in the palm of your hand. NUC-style mini PCs
                    didn't take over the desktop market in the same way that
                    ultrabooks came to dominate the laptop market, but the NUC
                    is still survived by a large ecosystem of similarly tiny
                    PCs, many of which are ultimately cheaper and easier to buy
                    than most NUCs were. Models include but are not limited to

                    Our universe could be twice as old as current estimates,
                    according to a new study that challenges the dominant
                    cosmological model and sheds new light on the so-called
                    "impossible early galaxy problem."

                    "Our newly-devised model stretches the galaxy formation time
                    by a several billion years, making the universe 26.7 billion
                    years old, and not 13.7 as previously estimated," says
                    author Rajendra Gupta, adjunct professor of physics in the
                    Faculty of Science at the University of Ottawa.

                    For years, astronomers and physicists have calculated the
                    age of our universe by measuring the time elapsed since the
                    Big Bang and by studying the oldest stars based on the
                    redshift of light coming from distant galaxies. In 2021,
                    thanks to new techniques and advances in technology, the age
                    of our universe was thus estimated at 13.797 billion years
                    using the Lambda-CDM concordance model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, many scientists have been puzzled by the existence
                    of stars like the Methuselah that appear to be older than
                    the estimated age of our universe and by the discovery of
                    early galaxies in an advanced state of evolution made
                    possible by the

                    after the Big Bang, appear to have a level of maturity and
                    mass typically associated with billions of years of cosmic
                    evolution. Furthermore, they're surprisingly small in size,
                    adding another layer of mystery to the equation.

                    A team of researchers has developed new LEDs which emit
                    light simultaneously in two different wavelength ranges, for
                    a simpler and more comprehensive way to monitor the
                    freshness of fruit and vegetables. As the team write in the
                    journal <i>Angewandte Chemie International Edition</i>,
                    modifying the LEDs with perovskite materials causes them to
                    emit in both the near-infrared range and the visible range,
                    a significant development in the contact-free monitoring of
                    food.

                  <p>
                    Perovskite crystals are able to capture and convert light.
                    Being simple to produce and highly efficient, perovskites
                    are already used in solar cells but are also being
                    intensively researched for suitability in other
                    technologies. Angshuman Nag and his team at the Indian
                    Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) in Pune,
                    India, are now proposing a perovskite application in LED
                    technology that could simplify the quality control of fresh
                    fruit and vegetables.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Without light converters, LEDs would emit light in rather
                    narrow light bands. To cover the whole range of white light
                    produced by the sun, the diodes in "phosphor-converted" (pc)
                    LEDs are coated with luminescent substances. Nag and his
                    team have used a double emission coating with the purpose to
                    produce pc-LEDs that emit both white ("normal") light and
                    also a strong band in the near-infrared range (NIR).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To make the dual-emission pc-LED, they applied a double
                    perovskite doped with bismuth and chromium. Part of the
                    bismuth component emits warm white light and another part
                    transfers energy to the chromium component, de-exciting it
                    and causing an additional emission in the NIR range, the
                    researchers found out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NIR is already used in the food industry to examine
                    freshness in fruit and vegetables. Nag and Ph.D. student
                    Sajid Saikia, first author of the paper, explain their idea.
                    "Food contains water, which absorbs the broad near-infrared
                    emission at around 1,000 nm. The more water that is present
                    [due to rotting], the greater the absorption of
                    near-infrared radiation, yielding darker contrast in an
                    image taken under near-infrared radiation. This easy,
                    non-invasive imaging process can estimate the water content
                    in different parts of food, assessing its freshness."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using these modified pc-LEDs to examine apples or
                    strawberries, the team observed dark spots that were not
                    visible in standard camera images. Illuminating the food
                    with both white and NIR light revealed normal coloring that
                    could be seen by the naked eye, as well as those parts which
                    were starting to rot, but not yet visibly so.

                    If viewers sometimes feel guilty about binge-watching
                    television programing, they really shouldn't. Though its
                    name implies impulsive behavior, binge-watching TV is a
                    common activity planned out by viewers, suggests new
                    research from the University of California San Diego's
                    <a href="https://rady.ucsd.edu/"

                  <p>
                    The study, in collaboration with the Tepper School of
                    Business at Carnegie Mellon University and Fox School of
                    Business at Temple University, reveals that viewers prefer
                    to binge-watch certain types of programming over others.
                    They're also more likely to pay to watch shows consecutively
                    and/or wait to be able to consume more than one episode at a
                    time.

                    "We find that the notion of a show being so interesting that
                    it just sucks people in and they can't pull away is not the
                    whole story," said study coauthor Uma Karmarkar, assistant
                    professor of marketing and innovation at UC San Diego's Rady
                    School of Management and School of Global Policy and
                    Strategy. "Binge-watching can have a negative connotation,
                    like binge eating or binge drinking. It is generally seen as
                    impulsive, maybe problematic, but certainly very indulgent.
                    However, media consumption is more complex. Binge-watching
                    is not always about a failure of self-control; it can also
                    be a thoughtful preference and planned behavior."

                  <p>
                    The paper that is forthcoming in "The Journal of
                    Experimental Psychology: Applied" finds that people tend to
                    plan to binge shows they perceive to be more sequential and
                    connected—those that have an overarching narrative. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the authors do find that no matter how bingeable a
                    show is, viewers are much less likely to plan to watch
                    multiple episodes if the streaming service or channel
                    features commercials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But the differences in plans to binge independent and
                    sequential media were also replicated in how people approach
                    streaming media in the form of online education courses. A
                    separate experiment revealed that people are more likely to
                    plan to binge a Coursera class if it is perceived to be more
                    sequential. Taking this one step further, the authors
                    analyzed real-world data from the Coursera platform and
                    found that these plans to binge-learn accurately predicted
                    viewing behavior in enrolled students.

                While “hacking” is often used to mean criminal intrusion into
                computer systems, some, including Bruce Schneier, use a more
                general definition that includes any kind of creative (mis-)use
                of something. While this kind of mindset is often talked about
                in tech circles, it is not restricted to it. The governor of the
                US state of Wisconsin found a

                This essentially changes the time frame of the adjustment from 2
                years (2023–2025) to 402 years (2023&amp;ndash2425). Bruce
                Schneier points out that this is not the first time Wisconsin's
                line-item veto has been used to change a timeframe, and
                <a

                to it as: “Definitely a hack. This is not what anyone thinks
                about when they imagine using a line-item veto.”

                    When Let's Encrypt first launched, we needed to ensure that
                    our certificates were widely trusted. To that end, we
                    arranged to have our intermediate certificates
                    <a
                      href="https://letsencrypt.org/2015/10/19/lets-encrypt-is-trusted.html"
                      >cross-signed by IdenTrust's DST Root CA X3</a
                    >. This meant that all certificates issued by those
                    intermediates would be trusted, even while our own ISRG Root
                    X1 wasn't yet. During subsequent years, our Root X1 became
                    <a
                      href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificate-compatibility/"
                      >widely trusted</a
                    >
                    on its own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Come late 2021, our cross-signed intermediates and DST Root
                    CA X3 itself were expiring. And while all up-to-date
                    browsers at that time trusted our root,
                    <a
                      href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet.html"

                    >
                    were still running old versions of the OS which would
                    suddenly stop trusting websites using our certificates. That
                    breakage would have been too widespread, so we arranged for
                    a new cross-sign – this time
                    <a
                      href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/12/21/extending-android-compatibility.html"
                      >directly onto our root</a
                    >
                    rather than our intermediates – which would outlive DST Root
                    CA X3 itself. This stopgap allowed those old Android devices
                    to continue trusting our certificates for three more years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On September 30th, 2024, that cross-sign too will expire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the last three years, the percentage of Android devices
                    which trust our ISRG Root X1 has risen from 66% to 93.9%.
                    That percentage will increase further over the next year,
                    especially as Android releases version 14, which has the
                    ability to
                    <a
                      href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-14-root-certificates-updatable"
                      >update its trust store without a full OS update</a
                    >. In addition, dropping the cross-sign will reduce the
                    number of certificate bytes sent in a TLS handshake by over
                    40%. Finally, it will significantly reduce our operating
                    costs, allowing us to focus our funding on continuing to
                    improve your privacy and security.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For these reasons, we will not be getting a new cross-sign
                    to extend compatibility any further.

                    Zwierlein's group has been studying the behavior of
                    potassium-40 atoms, which are known fermions, that can be
                    prepared in one of two spin states. When a potassium atom of
                    one spin interacts with an atom of another spin, they can
                    form a pair, similar to superconducting electrons. But under
                    normal, room-temperature conditions, the atoms interact in a
                    blur that is difficult to capture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "It was bloody difficult to get to a point where we
                    could actually take these images," Zwierlein says. "You can
                    imagine at first getting big fat holes in your imaging, your
                    atoms running away, nothing is working. We've had terribly
                    complicated problems to solve in the lab through the years,
                    and the students had great stamina, and finally, to be able
                    to see these images was absolutely elating."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What the team saw was pairing behavior among the atoms that
                    was predicted by the Hubbard model — a widely held theory
                    believed to hold they key to the behavior of electrons in
                    high-temperature superconductors, materials that exhibit
                    superconductivity at relatively high (though still very
                    cold) temperatures. Predictions of how electrons pair up in
                    these materials have been tested through this model, but
                    never directly observed until now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The pairing behavior between these atoms must also
                    occur in superconducting electrons, and Zwierlein says the
                    team's new snapshots will help to inform scientists'
                    understanding of high-temperature superconductors, and
                    perhaps provide insight into how these materials might be
                    tuned to higher, more practical temperatures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If you normalize our gas of atoms to the density of
                    electrons in a metal, we think this pairing behavior should
                    occur far above room temperature," Zwierlein offers. "That
                    gives a lot of hope and confidence that such pairing
                    phenomena can in principle occur at elevated temperatures,
                    and there's no a priori limit to why there shouldn't be a
                    room-temperature superconductor one day."

                    world's last declared chemical weapons stockpile as soon as
                    tomorrow, July 7th. The US and most other nations agreed to
                    completely eliminate their arsenals within 10 years after
                    the Chemical Weapons Convention took effect in 1997, but the
                    sheer size of the American collection (many of the warheads
                    are several decades old) and the complexity of safe disposal
                    left the country running late.

                    The current method relies on robots that puncture, drain and
                    wash the chemical-laden artillery shells and rockets, which
                    are then baked to render them harmless. The drained gas is
                    diluted in hot water and

                    either with bacteria (for mustard gas) or caustic soda (for
                    nerve agents). The remaining liquid is then incinerated.
                    Teams use X-rays to check for leaks before destruction
                    starts, and they remotely monitor robots to minimize contact
                    with hazardous material.

                    [...] The US last used chemical weapons in World War I, but
                    kept producing them for decades as a deterrent. Attention to
                    the program first spiked in 1968, when strange sheep deaths
                    led to revelations that the Army was storing chemical
                    weapons across the US and even testing them in the open.

                  <p>
                    This measure will only wipe out confirmed stockpiles. Russia

                    of secretly making nerve gas despite insisting that it
                    destroyed its last chemical weapons in 2017. Pro-government
                    Syrian military forces and ISIS extremists used the weapons
                    throughout much of the 2010s. This won't stop hostile
                    countries and terrorists from using the toxins.

                  <p>
                    Even so, this is a major milestone. In addition to wiping
                    out an entire category of weapons of mass destruction, it
                    represents another step toward reduced lethality in war.

                    Japan's Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has named
                    August 26 as its intended launch date for a lunar lander it
                    hopes will improve humanity's ability to touch down on other
                    worlds – as well as an astronomical observation that might
                    help us understand how they form.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) is also known
                    as the "Moon Sniper" thanks to its use of technologies that
                    JAXA claims "make a qualitative shift towards being able to
                    land where we want and not just where it is easy to land."
                    If JAXA can pull that off, it believes "it will become
                    possible to land on planets even more resource scarce than
                    the Moon."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The sobriquet "sniper" has been applied because the craft is
                    equipped with high-resolution cameras and an image
                    processing algorithm. As it swings into lunar orbit, it will
                    be able to recognize craters and measure its position, then
                    decide on an optimal spot to land. JAXA expects it to touch
                    down within 100 meters of its preferred target.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That accuracy is important, because it means future missions
                    can send instruments to specific locations, instead of
                    having to design missions around the places where landing
                    will be easiest. As the guy said – we do this not because
                    it's easy, but because it's hard.

                    If you're printing something on actual paper, there's a good
                    chance it's important, like a tax form or a job contract.

                    But popular printing products and services won't promise not
                    to read it. In fact, they won't even promise not to share it
                    with outside marketing firms.

                    The spread of digital file-sharing — along with obnoxious
                    business practices by printing manufacturers — has pushed
                    many U.S. households to give up at-home printers and rely on
                    nearby printing services instead. At the same time, major
                    printer manufacturers have adopted mobile apps and
                    cloud-based storage, creating new opportunities to collect
                    personal data from customers. Whether you're walking to the
                    corner store or sending your files to the cloud, it's tough
                    to figure out whether you're printing in private.

                    [...] So in a recent paper published in
                    <a
                      href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.201002"
                      ><em>Physical Review Letters</em></a
                    >, Slepian, Hou and Cahn proposed an inventive way to search
                    for evidence that parity was indeed violated during the Big
                    Bang. Their idea was to imagine every possible combination
                    of four galaxies in the night sky. Connect those four
                    galaxies together by imaginary lines, and you have a
                    lopsided pyramid, a tetrahedron. This is the simplest 3D
                    shape possible –and thus the simplest shape that has a
                    mirror image, the key test for parity symmetry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their method required analyzing a trillion possible
                    tetrahedrons for each of a million galaxies, an incredible
                    number of combinations. "Eventually we realized we needed
                    new math," Slepian said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Slepian's group discovered that, indeed, the universe
                    imprinted an early preference for left- or right-handed
                    stuff onto the material that eventually became today's
                    galaxies. (The complex math makes it difficult to say
                    whether that preference was for right-handedness or
                    left-handedness, though.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Since parity violation can only be imprinted on the
                    universe during inflation, if what we found is true, it
                    provides smoking-gun evidence for inflation," Slepian said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings by Slepian's lab can't yet explain how the laws
                    of physics changed, which will require new theories going
                    beyond the Standard Model, a theory that explains our
                    current universe. Now the race is on for scientists to
                    produce this theory that can explain the universe's ancient
                    handedness and the abundance of matter we see today.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    [...] How are we supposed to judge the value of large
                    scientific projects? With traditional projects the
                    cost-benefit analysis is rather straightforward. We sink in
                    a bunch of time and money into a project, and we judge the
                    success of those projects based on how much money they make
                    or how many benefits they provide to society.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But by their very nature large scientific projects don't
                    return any money on the investment. And they don't have any
                    immediate impact on society. So are they really worth it?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The first benefit that large scientific projects have
                    is that they provide a training ground for highly skilled
                    workers. The vast majority of the people working in large
                    collaborations are temporary researchers, hired right out of
                    grad school for a limited period of time to accomplish the
                    goals of the collaboration. Once the project is over those
                    people move on to other things, and since there are
                    essentially no jobs in academia most of those people go into
                    industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Secondly, many corporations are involved in the
                    process of assisting scientific goals. They may make
                    instruments or optics or specialized sensors, for example.
                    Those industries get paid to do their work and they develop
                    new technological solutions that can then be applied to
                    other problems or spun off into their own revenue generating
                    products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When it comes to satisfaction, we are all ultimately human.
                    Part of what makes us human is our innate curiosity about
                    the world around us. Science satisfies that curiosity in an
                    enormous way. Science makes the results of its research
                    available for public consumption. What we learn in science
                    is available and open to all. We enjoy the fruits of
                    scientific labor the same way we enjoy the work of artists
                    and musicians. It is something that touches all of us and
                    impacts all of us.

                    Accounting standards don't properly reflect the difference
                    between losses driven by investments and actual business
                    performance shortfalls, according to new University at
                    Buffalo School of Management research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Forthcoming in the Review of Accounting Studies, the study
                    found that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
                    mask the true value of companies by marking investments in
                    intangibles like technology, brands and human capital as
                    losses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Even as the economy boomed in 2019 following a decade of
                    growth, about half of all public companies reported losses
                    because accounting rules force them to report losses despite
                    initial success," says Feng Gu, Ph.D., chair and professor
                    of accounting and law in the UB School of Management. "This
                    is just another indication of how broken accounting is. We
                    need to treat intangible investments as real economic
                    assets."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "GAAP losers are less likely to decline, more likely
                    to reverse their losses, and even have better future stock
                    performance than real losers or profitable firms," says Gu.
                    "This is an alarming consequence for a group of highly
                    dynamic and innovative firms that are the driving force
                    behind the growing intangible revolution in our economy."

                  <p>
                    Researchers at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science
                    (CEMS) in Japan have discovered a compound that uses a
                    chemical reaction to store ammonia, potentially offering a
                    safer and easier way to store this important chemical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This discovery, published in the
                    <i>Journal of the American Chemical Society</i> on July 10,
                    makes it possible not only to safely and conveniently store
                    ammonia, but also the important hydrogen is [sic] carries.
                    This finding should help lead the way to a decarbonized
                    society with a practical hydrogen economy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For society to make the switch from carbon-based to
                    hydrogen-based energy, we need a safe way to store and
                    transport hydrogen, which by itself is highly combustible.
                    One way to do this is to store it as part of another
                    molecule and extract it as needed. Ammonia, chemically
                    written as NH<sub>3</sub>, makes a good hydrogen carrier
                    because three hydrogen atoms are packed into each molecule,
                    with almost 20% of ammonia being hydrogen by weight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem, however, is that ammonia is a highly corrosive
                    gas, making it difficult to store and use. Currently,
                    ammonia is generally stored by liquefying it at temperatures
                    well below freezing in pressure-resistant containers. Porous
                    compounds can also store ammonia at room temperature and
                    pressure, but storage capacity is low, and the ammonia
                    cannot always be retrieved easily.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new study reports the discovery of a perovskite, a
                    material with a distinctive repetitive crystal structure,
                    which can easily store ammonia and also allows easy and
                    complete retrieval at relatively low temperatures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research team led by Masuki Kawamoto at RIKEN CEMS
                    focused on the perovskite ethylammonium lead iodide
                    (EAPbI<sub>3</sub>), chemically written as
                    CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>.
                    They found that its one-dimensional columnar structure
                    undergoes a chemical reaction with ammonia at room
                    temperature and pressure, and dynamically transforms into a
                    two-dimensional layered structure called lead iodide
                    hydroxide, or Pb(OH)I.

                    Kadrey's Sandman Slime. And Meta allegedly infringed

                    [...] Authors are already upset that companies seem to be
                    unfairly profiting off their copyrighted materials, and the
                    Meta lawsuit noted that any unfair profits currently gained
                    could further balloon, as "Meta plans to make the next
                    version of LLaMA commercially available." In addition to
                    other damages, the authors are asking for restitution of

                    US chip sanctions are hurting China. They cover not only
                    direct sales from American and European companies. They
                    extend to foreign-made products that use US software and
                    technology. China is reeling – and striking back.

                  <p>
                    But beware. Democracies – Japan, Europe, and the US – need
                    to ensure that additional moves designed to hurt Beijing do
                    not "boomerang" and end up hurting their own industries.

                    of its revenues in China – this will now diminish as it
                    cannot sell its latest equipment to China, and legacy

                    agreed to reduce dependence on China. That's not a

                    This new Arctic paper "helps to show that any increase in
                    production is matched in the environment," says Steve Allen,
                    a microplastics researcher at the Ocean Frontiers Institute
                    who did the peatland study. "And as more research into human
                    exposure comes to light, I believe the increase will also be
                    shown in human bodies."

                    [...] This burden on ecosystems is why environmentalists and
                    scientists are calling for the United Nations plastics

                    >. In March, researchers provided hints that a cap could
                    produce quick results: They found that although ocean

                    >, they actually fluctuated between 1990 and 2005—perhaps
                    due to the effectiveness of a 1988 international agreement
                    that limited plastic pollution from ships.

                    Kim writes that the new paper is another data point in favor
                    of production limits: "This strongly supports the urgent
                    need of globally concerted vigorous action to substantially
                    reduce the plastic ocean input, and thus to protect the
                    Arctic environment."
