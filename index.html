                    Video Visit Asia's emerging megacities and you'll quickly
                    notice that scooters and motorbikes vastly outnumber cars.
                    Before long these fleets of two-wheelers will become
                    battery-powered, always-connected, semi-autonomous machines
                    that offer an even more potent alternative to their
                    four-wheeled rivals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The reasons powered two-wheelers dominate nations such as
                    India, Indonesia and Vietnam – with a combined population
                    over 1.75 billion – are simple: cars are unaffordable on
                    local wages, few urban homes have space to store them, and
                    warm climates make two-wheelers viable year-round. Plus,
                    many of them sell for less than the equivalent of $1,000
                    apiece.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The industry has decided many will soon be electric and it
                    looks like drivers will buy them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Electrification of micromobility can be adopted at a faster
                    pace than cars, mainly because the motor and batteries are
                    much smaller," Fook Fah Yap, a director at Singapore's
                    Nanyang Technical University's Transport Research Centre
                    told <i>The Register</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Evidence of the shift is not hard to find. Earlier this year
                    Honda announced it will start to sell 10 battery-powered
                    bikes in 2025. Yamaha expects 90 percent of its sales will
                    be electrified by 2050 and Toyota is expected to announce an
                    electric two-wheeler this year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Two—wheelers, by contrast, are all about getting from
                    A to B, quickly and at low cost. Digital technology's role
                    in a two-wheeler is therefore all about information related
                    to navigation.

                    First discovered 60 years ago, quasars can shine as brightly
                    as a trillion stars packed into a volume the size of our
                    Solar System. In the decades since they were first observed,
                    it has remained a mystery what could trigger such powerful
                    activity. New work led by scientists at the Universities of
                    Sheffield and Hertfordshire has now revealed that it is a
                    consequence of galaxies crashing together.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The collisions were discovered when researchers, using deep
                    imaging observations from the Isaac Newton Telescope in La
                    Palma, observed the presence of distorted structures in the
                    outer regions of the galaxies that are home to quasars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most galaxies have supermassive black holes at their
                    centres. They also contain substantial amounts of gas – but
                    most of the time this gas is orbiting at large distances
                    from the galaxy centres, out of reach of the black holes.
                    Collisions between galaxies drive the gas towards the black
                    hole at the galaxy centre; just before the gas is consumed
                    by the black hole, it releases extraordinary amounts of
                    energy in the form of radiation, resulting in the
                    characteristic quasar brilliance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This is the first time that a sample of quasars of
                    this size has been imaged with this level of sensitivity. By
                    comparing observations of 48 quasars and their host galaxies
                    with images of over 100 non-quasar galaxies, researchers
                    concluded that galaxies hosting quasars are approximately
                    three times as likely to be interacting or colliding with
                    other galaxies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study has provided a significant step forward in our
                    understanding of how these powerful objects are triggered
                    and fuelled.

              <p>
                Researchers have uncovered malicious firmware that can turn
                residential and small office routers into proxies for Chinese
                state-sponsored hackers. The firmware implant, discovered by
                Check Point Research, includes a full-featured backdoor that
                allows attackers to establish communication, issue commands, and
                perform file transfers with infected devices. The implant was
                found in TP-Link routers but could be modified to work on other
                router models.
              </p>
              <p>
                The malware's main purpose is to relay traffic between infected
                targets and command-and-control servers, obscuring the origins
                and destinations of the communication. The control
                infrastructure was traced back to hackers associated with the
                Chinese government. By using a chain of infected devices, the
                attackers can hide the final command and control and make it
                difficult for defenders to detect and respond to the attack.
              </p>
              <p>
                This technique of using routers and other IoT devices as proxies
                is a common tactic among threat actors. The researchers are

                While the firmware image discovered so far only affects TP-Link
                devices, the modular design allows the threat actors to create
                images for a wider range of hardware. The article concludes with
                recommendations for users to check for potential infections and
                apply proactive mitigations such as patching routers and using
                strong passwords.

                    The researchers further concluded that their analysis
                    supports the use of junk food taxes implemented as excise
                    taxes paid by manufacturers or distributors, rather than
                    sales taxes that need to be administered by retailers and
                    paid directly by consumers. Revenue from excise taxes can be
                    earmarked for particular uses, including improving access to
                    healthy food in low-resource communities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "An advantage of excise taxes is that food companies may be
                    motivated to reformulate their products to be healthier to
                    avoid taxation," said study co-author Sean Cash of the
                    Friedman School at Tufts. "Defining foods to be taxed is not
                    a static exercise, as existing products are reformulated and
                    thousands of new packaged foods are introduced each year—so
                    how we tax foods is not just a tool for steering consumers
                    away from the least healthy options, but also for
                    encouraging healthy innovations in what ends up on the
                    supermarket shelves."

                    As zip and mov are now two generally approved TLDs, internet

                    URLs to open in a web browser. Cyber-criminals have already
                    started to exploit the new gTLDs, with a now-defunct
                    phishing page at "microsoft-office.zip" designed to try and

                    Trapped in the bio-oil, Charm Industrial thinks it can store
                    the CO2 underground for thousands to millions of years to
                    keep it from making climate change worse. That's how the
                    startup can now sell carbon removal credits, representing
                    tons of captured CO2, to companies that want to use its
                    service to try to cancel out some of its own carbon dioxide
                    pollution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So far, Charm has successfully stored more than 6,100 metric
                    tons of CO2 in the form of bio-oil. (A previous purchase
                    from Microsoft, at 2,000 metric tons of CO2, is a big chunk
                    of that.) So the deal announced today is a major escalation
                    and a vote of confidence from Big Tech companies that have
                    been early backers of the nascent carbon removal industry.

                  <p>
                    The advantage Charm says it has is that its plan is
                    decentralized. Other companies are building big plants to

                    A key component of any processor is instruction decoding:
                    analyzing a numeric opcode and figuring out what actions
                    need to be taken. The Intel 8086 processor (1978) has a
                    complex instruction set, making instruction decoding a
                    challenge. The first step in decoding an 8086 instruction is
                    something called the Group Decode ROM, which categorizes
                    instructions into about 35 types that control how the
                    instruction is decoded and executed. For instance, the Group
                    Decode ROM determines if an instruction is executed in
                    hardware or in microcode. It also indicates how the
                    instruction is structured: if the instruction has a bit
                    specifying a byte or word operation, if the instruction has
                    a byte that specifies the addressing mode, and so forth.

                    "Typically, when everyone's in the office at the same time,
                    you can usually tell that if someone is near the water
                    cooler it's OK to go and disturb them. Or if someone is
                    walking in the corridor, you can start a conversation as you
                    walk past," said Pranav Khadpe, an HCII Ph.D. student and
                    one of the paper's co-authors. "But online, we don't have
                    those lightweight signals. Nooks can help to replace these
                    social cues."

                    ice without any preconceived notion of who is in the group,"
                    Bali said. "This helps to avoid social anxiety of, say, not
                    knowing anyone in the Nook or feeling intimidated if you see
                    it includes colleagues of a different team or higher level."

                    [...] "Beyond supporting personal wellbeing, positive social
                    interactions at work diffuse ideas, accelerate
                    decision-making, promote better collaboration and enhance
                    productivity," Khadpe said. "It's a neat win-win situation
                    that Nooks can help facilitate."

                    [...] But Chinese chip specialists believe that despite
                    oversupply risks, domestic chipmakers should concentrate on
                    trailing nodes rather than on desperately investing in
                    sub-14nm and more advanced fabrication technologies.
                    Focusing on mature processes can lead to increased
                    self-sufficiency and controllability of the semiconductor
                    industry, reducing dependence on foreign technology and
                    supplies.

                    [...] Meanwhile, domestic suppliers of lithography tools can
                    make scanners with enough resolution for a 90nm-class node
                    and it is even unclear whether they can make them in
                    sufficient quantities. Therefore, Chinese chipmakers will
                    keep buying tools produced by companies from Japan and the
                    Netherlands. So while China's chip sector is striving for
                    autonomy, it will likely keep relying on WFE made abroad.

                    AI language model the ability to analyze an entire book's
                    worth of material in under a minute. This new ability comes
                    from expanding Claude's context window to 100,000 tokens, or
                    about 75,000 words.

                  <p>
                    Like OpenAI's GPT-4, Claude is a large language model (LLM)
                    that works by predicting the next token in a sequence when
                    given a certain input. Tokens are fragments of words used to
                    simplify AI data processing, and a "context window" is
                    similar to short-term memory—how much human-provided input
                    data an LLM can process at once.<br />[...]<br />While it
                    may not sound impressive to pick out changes in a text
                    (Microsoft Word can do that, but only if it has two
                    documents to compare), consider that after feeding Claude
                    the text of The Great Gatsby, the AI model can then
                    interactively answer questions about it or analyze its
                    meaning. 100,000 tokens is a big upgrade for LLMs. By
                    comparison, OpenAI's
                    <a

                    >
                    LLM boasts context window lengths of 4,096 tokens (about
                    3,000 words) when used as part of ChatGPT and 8,192 or
                    32,768 tokens via the GPT-4 API (which is currently only
                    available via waitlist).<br />[...]<br />Notably, Anthropic

              <p>
                A recent study challenges the idea that evolution always leads
                to increased complexity in animals. By analyzing gene
                arrangements on chromosomes, researchers sought to understand
                the evolutionary relationships between species.
              </p>
              <p>
                The study found that sponges, which lack muscles and a nervous
                system, are more closely related to humans than comb jellies,
                which possess both traits. This contradicts the assumption that
                complexity determines evolutionary proximity. The research
                suggests two potential explanations: either sponges and other
                simple animals lost nerves and muscles over time, simplifying
                their body plans, or nerves and muscles evolved independently in
                different lineages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further investigation, such as studying the nerve and muscle
                cells of comb jellies in a lab, is needed to differentiate
                between these possibilities. The study underscores the
                complexity of animal evolution and challenges existing notions
                of evolutionary relationships based on traits and complexity.

                    Chinese smartphone giant Oppo is disbanding its young chip
                    design unit Zeku as weak global demand forces major handset
                    manufacturers to cut costs and restrategize.

                  <p>
                    The decision comes as a surprise to those who believe the
                    phone maker is bolstering its in-house chip development as
                    rising geopolitical tensions with the U.S. threatens to cut
                    Chinese firms off key suppliers. In the foreseeable future,
                    Oppo will have to revert back to relying on third-party chip
                    partners.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Oppo explained its decision to cut its once-promising
                    chip team in a statement issued today: "Due to the
                    uncertainties in the global economy and the smartphone
                    industry, we have to make difficult adjustments for
                    long-term development. Therefore, the company has decided to
                    cease the operation of Zeku."

                    processing unit designed to boost photo and video
                    performance through machine learning, following Apple's path
                    to bring chip design in-house. Zeku also set up a

                  <p>
                    [...] Oppo's retreat from chips signals another struggle
                    from Chinese phone companies to strengthen their control
                    over the semiconductor supply chain. Huawei lost access to
                    advanced chips from the U.S. due to Trump-era sanctions, and
                    its attempt to design its own high-end chips through
                    HiSilicon floundered after the U.S. cut it off major
                    foundries. The company resorted to

                    business.

                your personal email account with Google have been inactive for

                    To reduce this risk, we are updating our inactivity policy
                    for Google Accounts to 2 years across our products. Starting

                Notice that they MAY delete the account and all the content.
                Weird that they say may instead of will. Will some of them be
                kept around anyway? Are they saving the content but deleting the
                account? Is it so the Google AI can have one long good snoop
                before it goes into dev/null?

                I might have missed it but to delete accounts for security
                reasons, that seems to be the reason given, is by itself sort of
                a security issue. After all what stops someone from
                re-registering the names afterwards. Hope that whatever mail
                they had keeps on sending to the address. Or it can be used to
                recover account credentials with other services. Deleting in
                that regard seems bad if they do not also block re-registration
                of said emails for a very very long time. Most of them will be
                duds but if you automate the process you'll hit digital
                credentials gold eventually.

                "Powerful magnetic pulses applied to the scalp to stimulate the
                brain can bring fast relief to many severely depressed patients
                for whom standard treatments have failed. Yet it's been a
                mystery exactly how transcranial magnetic stimulation, as the
                treatment is known, changes the brain to dissipate depression.
                Now, research led by Stanford Medicine scientists has found that
                the treatment works by reversing the direction of abnormal brain
                signals."
              </p>
              <p>
                "When they analyzed fMRI data across the whole brain, one
                connection stood out. In the normal brain, the anterior insula,
                a region that integrates bodily sensations, sends signals to a
                region that governs emotions, the anterior cingulate cortex.
              </p>
              <p>
                "You could think of it as the anterior cingulate cortex
                receiving this information about the body—like heart rate or
                temperature—and then deciding how to feel on the basis of all
                these signals," Mitra said.
              </p>
              <p>
                In three-quarters of the participants with depression, however,
                the typical flow of activity was reversed: The anterior
                cingulate cortex sent signals to the anterior insula. The more
                severe the depression, the higher the proportion of signals that
                traveled the wrong way."
              </p>
              <p>
                "When depressed patients were treated with SNT, the flow of
                neural activity shifted to the normal direction within a week,
                coinciding with a lifting of their depression."

                    As a family of large language models (LLMs), PaLM 2 has been
                    trained on an enormous volume of data and does next-word
                    prediction, which outputs the most likely text after a
                    prompt input by humans. PaLM stands for "Pathways Language
                    Model," and "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12533"

                    Finding, cultivating, and bioengineering organisms that can
                    digest plastic not only aids in the removal of pollution,
                    but is now also big business. Several microorganisms that
                    can do this have already been found, but when their enzymes
                    that make this possible are applied at an industrial scale,
                    they typically only work at temperatures above 30°C. The
                    heating required means that industrial applications remain
                    costly to date, and aren't carbon-neutral. But there is a
                    possible solution to this problem: finding specialist
                    cold-adapted microbes whose enzymes work at lower
                    temperatures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Here we show that novel microbial taxa obtained from
                    the 'plastisphere' of alpine and arctic soils were able to
                    break down biodegradable plastics at 15°C," said first
                    author Dr Joel Rüthi, currently a guest scientist at WSL.
                    "These organisms could help to reduce the costs and
                    environmental burden of an enzymatic recycling process for
                    plastic."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] None of the strains were able to digest PE
                    [non-biodegradable polyethylene], even after 126 days of
                    incubation on these plastics. But 19 (56%) of strains,
                    including 11 fungi and eight bacteria, were able to digest
                    PUR [biodegradable polyester-polyurethane] at 15°C, while 14
                    fungi and three bacteria were able to digest the plastic
                    mixtures of PBAT [biodegradable polybutylene adipate
                    terephthalate] and PLA [biodegradable polylactic acid].
                    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and a fluorescence-based
                    assay confirmed that these strains were able to chop up the
                    PBAT and PLA polymers into smaller molecules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It was very surprising to us that we found that a large
                    fraction of the tested strains was able to degrade at least
                    one of the tested plastics," said Rüthi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The best performers were two uncharacterized fungal species
                    in the genera <em>Neodevriesia</em> and
                    <em>Lachnellula</em>: these were able to digest all of the
                    tested plastics except PE. The results also showed that the
                    ability to digest plastic depended on the culture medium for
                    most strains, with each strain reacting differently to each
                    of four media tested.

                    [...] The practice illustrates the fine line online services
                    often walk when attempting to protect end users from common
                    threats while also respecting privacy. As Brandt notes,
                    actively cracking a password-protected zip file feels
                    invasive. At the same time, this practice almost surely has
                    prevented large numbers of users from falling prey to social
                    engineering attacks attempting to infect their computers.

                    One other thing readers should remember: password-protected
                    zip files provide minimal assurance that content inside the
                    archives can't be read. As Beaumont noted, ZipCrypto, the
                    default means for encrypting zip files in Windows, is

                    meters (about 33 feet) below modern-day Naples, Italy. But
                    the site is in a densely populated urban district, making it
                    challenging to undertake careful archaeological excavations
                    of those ruins. So a team of scientists turned to cosmic
                    rays for help—specifically an imaging technique called
                    muography, or

                    There are many variations of muon imaging, but they all
                    typically involve gas-filled chambers. As muons zip through
                    the gas, they collide with the gas particles and emit a
                    telltale flash of light, which is recorded by the detector,
                    allowing scientists to calculate the particle's energy and
                    trajectory. It's similar to X-ray imaging or
                    ground-penetrating radar, except with naturally occurring
                    high-energy muons rather than X-rays or radio waves. That
                    higher energy makes it possible to image thick, dense
                    substances like the stones used to build pyramids. The
                    denser the imaged object, the more muons are blocked,
                    casting a telltale shadow. Hidden chambers would appear in
                    the final image because they blocked fewer particles.

                    Neapolis was a Hellenistic city in a hilly area rich in
                    volcanic tuff rock. That made it soft enough to sculpt out
                    tombs, worship spaces, or caves for housing. The necropolis
                    in what is now the Sanita district of Naples was one such
                    creation, used for burials from the late fourth century BCE
                    to early first century CE. The site was buried in sediment
                    over time by a series of natural disasters, most notably
                    flooding by the <em>lava dei vergini</em> ("lava of the
                    virgins"). Unlike the volcanic lava that famously engulfed
                    Pompeii, this "lava" was made up of mud and rocks that came
                    loose from the hills during heavy rains.

                    the presence of perchlorate salts, which have been detected
                    in the planet's soil and are generally considered to be
                    toxic for plants.

                  <p>
                    The team was able to simulate Martian soil using basaltic
                    rich soil mined from the Mojave Desert, called the Mojave
                    Mars Simulant, or MMS, which was developed by scientists
                    from NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The teams then grew three varieties of rice, including one
                    wild-type and two gene-edited lines with genetic mutations
                    that better enable them to respond to stress, such as
                    drought, sugar starvation or salinity. These varieties were
                    grown in the MMS, as well as a regular potted mix and a
                    hybrid of the two. While plants were able to grow in the
                    Martian simulant, they were not as developed as those grown
                    in the potting soil and hybrid mix. Replacing just a quarter
                    of the Martian simulant with potting soil resulted in
                    improved development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team also experimented with the amount of perchlorate in
                    the soil, finding that 3 grams per kilogram was the
                    threshold beyond which nothing would grow, while mutant
                    strains could still root in 1 gram per kilogram.

                  <p>
                    Their findings suggest that there might be a way forward for
                    genetically modified rice to find purchase in Martian soil.

                    A dermatologist in New York City has reported the country's
                    first known cases of highly contagious ringworm infections
                    that are resistant to common anti-fungal treatments—and
                    caused by a newly emerging fungus that is rapidly
                    outstripping other infectious fungi around the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    [...] Ringworm—aka tineas, dermatophytosis, jock itch, and
                    athlete's foot—is a superficial fungal infection of the skin
                    that causes red, itchy, sometimes scaly circular rashes.
                    There are more than 40 different species of fungi that can
                    cause the infection, which spreads from infected people and
                    animals and also lurks in environments and on common
                    household items, like towels. Ringworm is extremely common
                    and can strike anyone. Usually, it's treatable with
                    over-the-counter creams.

                    [...] While alarming, the identification of cases in the US
                    is not surprising. The fungus behind the infections is
                    <em>Trichophyton indotineae</em> (previously described as
                    <em>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</em> type VIII), which is a
                    newly emerging fungus globally. Though genetic studies date

                    causes of ringworm, and the pathogen has rapidly emerged in

                    [...] The rise of <em>T. indotineae</em> is linked to the
                    abuse of topical treatments that contain egregiously large
                    combinations of steroids and antifungal/antibacterial
                    agents, spurring the development of resistance. This is

                        The track and the rhythm has to be at the forefront if
                        you want to move people. As soon as you put the vocal up
                        at the forefront, the track loses its energy and its
                        immediacy and it becomes something else, which is why I
                        think it suits jazz or folk.

                      <p>
                        But the minute you do that on a pop song, you kind of
                        lose people in that connection to feel the energy of a
                        track ... It loses a kind of visceral immediacy that
                        people are conditioned to, and it will make the song
                        kind of feel a little dull.

                        So now we're in this kind of arms race of audio and
                        sound and volume to get these tracks louder and louder.
                        So, yeah, now I think we're at a point where, for the
                        most part, it's the beat, a little bit of vocal, and
                        maybe one little element of music in there. You know,
                        this is a long way from the world of [The Beatles']

                    In a first among United States automakers, Tesla will begin
                    refining its own lithium, a critical material for electric
                    vehicle batteries.

                    The company broke ground on a $375 million lithium refining
                    plant in Corpus Christi, Texas, this week, which CEO Elon
                    Musk said will process enough lithium for 1 million vehicles

                    >
                    to help address this gap in domestic battery manufacturing.
                    The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law last August,
                    also adjusted the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit so that eligible
                    vehicles must meet certain battery sourcing requirements,
                    with materials largely coming from the U.S. or
                    free-trade-agreement partners.

                    Tesla processing its own lithium will help ensure the
                    company's vehicles qualify for those credits and will
                    protect it from supply chain fluctuations and geopolitical
                    disruptions. While it is the only U.S. automaker with a plan
                    to refine its own lithium so far,
                    <a

                    that it would invest $650 million in the Thacker Pass
                    lithium mining project in Nevada.

                  <p>
                    Tesla claims its refining process is more environmentally
                    friendly and will consume 20 percent less energy than
                    conventional methods. It will also produce less-toxic
                    byproducts that could be repurposed in construction
                    materials, the company said. "We end up as a net
                    environmentally very neutral site," said Turner Caldwell,
                    senior manager of battery minerals and metals at Tesla. The
                    company estimates construction on the Texas plant will
                    conclude in 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Caldwell said that while the Texas facility's lithium
                    will originally come from hardrock mines, the process is
                    designed to be "feed flexible," meaning it could in the
                    future refine lithium from recycled sources, such as
                    manufacturing scrap and end-of-life batteries.

                    [...] Past genetics research has been criticized for relying
                    too heavily on DNA from people of European heritage.
                    Studying just one population of people could mean missing
                    genetic variants that have arisen in specific populations,
                    O'Connor says. "Having a pangenome reference allows us to
                    assess that population-specific variation in a much more
                    detailed way. And hopefully, that will then lead to greater
                    insight into the biology of everyone."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the pangenome is a great first step to better
                    represent all human genetic diversity, O'Connor says, "it
                    still is missing key groups in the world. It's still
                    underrepresenting Latin Americans and Indigenous Americans,
                    and ... there's nobody included from Oceania.... There's
                    still a lot more variation that needs to be added to the
                    pangenome to really, truly be representative of everyone."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Added diversity is coming, human geneticist Karen Miga of
                    the University of California, Santa Cruz said during a May 9
                    news conference. The consortium plans to complete a total of
                    350 genomes, including these 47, by mid-2024. The first
                    phase of the project was aimed at developing the technology
                    to build the pangenome.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Researchers hope the pangenome will help them more
                    easily diagnose the genetic changes that contribute to rare
                    diseases and find treatments for common disorders, he says.
                    Once that happens, clinicians may start incorporating data
                    from the pangenome in their practices.

                    are also looking to certification and pre-employment testing

                    Interestingly, a college degree is no longer seen as such a
                    huge benefit. Businesses responding to the Linux
                    Foundation's research felt upskilling (91%) and
                    certifications (77%) are more important than a university

                    [...] In a second study, Frank and Oremus look at a separate
                    criticism of the policy: that it is not doing enough to
                    rebuild fish populations or that fish populations would have
                    rebounded on their own without the policy. They discover the
                    opposite to be true. Fish subject to the policy saw their
                    size increase to be 52.2% larger than those comparable fish
                    in the European Union, where similar fishing policies were
                    not yet in effect.

                  <p>
                    Comparing U.S. fish populations that were depleted before
                    the rebuilding policy went into effect to U.S. fish
                    populations that were depleted after the policy went into
                    effect, Frank and Oremus find that in the absence of policy
                    the declining fish populations continued to decline by about
                    45%. But when the policy took effect, it took five to 10
                    years for the fish population to double in size—recovering
                    to be about 98% greater in size than when it was first
                    threatened.

                    policymakers that science-based management of biological
                    resources actually works," Oremus says.

                    "interpretability," which is a field of AI that seeks to

                    the first sentence of OpenAI's paper, the authors write,

                My thoughts were always that you didn't get to look into the
                black box of goodies. As opposed to no one even knows how this
                magic things works. As the kids say, YOLO, because "hold my

                    Airplane wastewater is a key source for COVID-19
                    surveillance because international travelers frequently
                    bring new variants into the country, experts say. As fewer
                    people get their noses swabbed in health care facilities,

                    In a study published today in the journal
                    <i>Quaternary Science Reviews</i>, an international research
                    team led by scientists from the University of Tübingen and
                    the Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and
                    Paleoenvironment presents the earliest human footprints
                    known from Germany. The tracks were discovered in the
                    roughly 300,000-year-old Schöningen Paleolithic site complex
                    in Lower Saxony. The footprints, presumably from Homo
                    heidelbergensis, are surrounded by several animal
                    tracks—collectively, they present a picture of the ecosystem
                    at that time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The various tracks at Schöningen offer a snapshot of a
                    family's daily life and may provide information about the
                    behavior and social composition of hominin groups as well as
                    spatial interactions and coexistence with elephant herds and
                    other, smaller mammals, according to the study. "Based on
                    the tracks, including those of children and juveniles, this
                    was probably a family outing rather than a group of adult
                    hunters," says the archaeologist and expert on fossil
                    footprints.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to the human tracks, the team analyzed a series
                    of elephant tracks attributable to the extinct species
                    Palaeoloxodon antiquus—an elephant with straight tusks that
                    was the largest land animal at the time and whose adult
                    bulls reached a body weight of up to 13 tons.

                    People who follow the Mediterranean diet—rich in fats from
                    olive oil and nuts—tend to live longer, healthier lives than
                    others who chow down primarily on fast food, meat and dairy.
                    But it hasn't been clear on a cellular level exactly why the
                    diet is so beneficial.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now researchers led by the Stanford School of Medicine have
                    found one of the first cellular connections between healthy
                    fats—known as monounsaturated fatty acids—and lifespan in
                    laboratory worms. The finding hints at a complex
                    relationship between diet, fats and longevity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Fats are generally thought to be detrimental to health,"
                    said professor of genetics Anne Brunet, Ph.D. "But some
                    studies have shown that specific types of fats, or lipids,
                    can be beneficial."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers learned that one of the fats in the
                    Mediterranean diet, oleic acid, increases the number of two
                    key cellular structures, or organelles, and protects
                    cellular membranes from damage by a chemical reaction called
                    oxidation. This protective effect has a big payoff: Worms
                    fed food rich in oleic acid lived about 35% longer than
                    those consigned to standard worm rations, the researchers
                    found.

                    Chemotherapy that does not harm the body, but effectively
                    fights cancer cells: that is the goal of chemist Sylvestre
                    Bonnet and his team. During his Ph.D. research, chemist
                    Xuequan Zhou brought that goal a little closer. He developed
                    molecules that, upon injection into the bloodstream,
                    self-assemble into nanoparticles that accumulate in the
                    tumor. Targeted irradiation with visible light then attacks
                    the tumor. The research has now been published in
                    <i>Nature Chemistry</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Conventional anti-cancer drugs often do not differentiate
                    enough between good and bad cells," Bonnet explains. "They
                    kill them both." The researchers have come up with a
                    solution to this problem: nanoparticles that target the
                    tumor and only become active under the influence of visible
                    light. "This anticancer phototherapy allows doctors to treat
                    a specific part of the body without damaging the rest. It is
                    already in use in several hospitals." Molecules that form
                    nanoparticles by themselves
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Until now, chemists had to first attach the chemotherapy
                    drugs to nanoparticles in the lab. Doctors then administered
                    them by injection into the patient's bloodstream.
                    Conjugation to the nanoparticles helped the chemotherapy
                    find the tumor. Zhou's drug works slightly differently. "The
                    lab work is no longer necessary," he says. "You can
                    administer the molecules directly. Once in the blood,
                    nanoparticles then form all by themselves."

                    modules in August 2022. At that time, Samsung was trying to
                    promote a wider (and faster) adoption of the newest DDR5
                    memory modules while still supporting the DDR4 market,
                    forcing router manufacturers and the other companies still
                    using the slower (and cheaper) DDR3 modules to upgrade their
                    memory needs.

                    Besides cutting production and making DDR3 modules cheaper,
                    in 2022 Samsung also offered discounts on DDR4 and DDR5 chip
                    prices. And the adoption rate of the newer memory standards
                    grew accordingly. Now, consumers have taken a more
                    conservative approach to hi-tech spending, and Samsung is
                    seemingly willing to make its chip-making machines rest
                    while waiting for a market rebound.

                    As lawmakers worldwide attempt to understand how to regulate
                    rapidly advancing AI technologies, Microsoft chief economist
                    Michael Schwarz told attendees of the World Economic Forum
                    Growth Summit today that "we shouldn't regulate AI until we
                    see some meaningful harm that is actually happening, not
                    imaginary scenarios."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The comments came about 45 minutes into a

                    called "Growth Hotspots: Harnessing the Generative AI
                    Revolution." Reacting, another featured speaker, CNN anchor
                    Zain Asher, stopped Schwarz to ask, "Wait, we should wait
                    until we see harm before we regulate it?"<br />[...]<br />Lawmakers
                    are racing to draft AI regulations that acknowledge harm but
                    don't threaten AI progress. Last year, the US Federal Trade
                    Commission (FTC)
                    <a
                      href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/06/ftc-report-warns-about-using-artificial-intelligence-combat-online-problems"
                      >warned</a
                    >
                    Congress that lawmakers should exercise "great caution" when
                    drafting AI policy solutions. The FTC regards harms as
                    instances where "AI tools can be inaccurate, biased, and
                    discriminatory by design and incentivize relying on
                    increasingly invasive forms of commercial surveillance."

                    millimeters over most of the 20th century, to 3.6
                    millimeters by the early 21st century. From just the years
                    2013 to 2018, that number

                    Yet, crucially, most sea level rise simulations and
                    predictions don't take into account what's happening under
                    Petermann and the many glaciers like it. This means we might
                    be underestimating sea level rise over the coming decades
                    and beyond. In the study, the researchers noted that such
                    ocean melting "will make projections of sea level rise from
                    glaciers potentially double."

                    "This process is not accounted for in many models today for
                    sea level rise," Ciraci explained. "The potential
                    contribution is significant."

                        you're coming from, and as you point out, you deserve a
                        clear, good-faith answer. Unfortunately that answer is

                      <p>
                        [...] Again, I'm personally sorry to have to say this.
                        Way back in 2000 I had a few patches accepted into the
                        kernel, and I led the port of Roblox game servers from
                        Windows to Linux several years ago. From a technical and
                        philosophical perspective, it would be a wonderful thing
                        to do. But our first responsibility is to our overall
                        community, and the opportunity cost of supporting a
                        Linux client is far, far too high to justify.

                    They're clearly not going to be releasing a Native Linux
                    build, which I think most people probably
                    <em>already</em> knew, but at least previously they
                    repeatedly said that Wine was a "priority" to support but
                    now it doesn't sound as likely going by the above.

                        users to play a wide variety of games, create games, and
                        chat with others online. It combines gaming, social
                        media, and social commerce. Billing itself as the
                        “ultimate virtual universe,” Roblox experiences are
                        places where users can socialize, build their own
                        spaces, and even earn and spend virtual money.

                    The pharmaceutical company behind Martin Shkreli's infamous
                    4,000 percent price hike—now known as Vyera
                    Pharmaceuticals—filed for bankruptcy this week and plans to
                    sell its assets to pay off millions in debts.
                  </p>

                      >In court documents filed Wednesday</a
                    >, Vyera's chief restructuring officer, Lawrence Perkins,
                    largely blamed Shkreli for dooming the company and its
                    affiliates.<br />[...]<br />Shkreli founded Vyera in 2014
                    under the name Turing Pharmaceuticals. His focus was to
                    acquire sole-source drugs that treat life-threatening
                    conditions in small populations of patients—and then
                    dramatically jack up the price. In August 2015, he did just
                    that, buying the rights to the decades-old anti-parasitic
                    drug Daraprim for $55 million and abruptly raising the price
                    from $17.60 per tablet to $750, a more than 4,000 percent
                    increase.<br />[...]<br />Shkreli's influence wasn't shaken
                    until January 2020, when the Federal Trade Commission and
                    several state attorneys general sued Shkreli and the
                    company—then called Vyera—for allegedly violating antitrust
                    laws. Soon after, Vyera appointed a new board and management
                    to purge ties to Shkreli. Vyera later settled the FTC's
                    lawsuit, while Shkreli insisted on going to trial, where he
                    lost, was

                    He is appealing the ruling.
                  </p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, Vyera never reversed Shkreli's price hike.</p>

                    Brexit politics are not the only hurdle. OneWeb's Gen One
                    satellites need upgrading, and Eutelsat is planning to have
                    more advanced Gen Two satellites in orbit by 2027. Berneke
                    says this upgrade will cost 3 billion to 4 billion euros
                    ($3.3-4.4 billion), a bold move for a company with a
                    reputation for playing it safe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] SpaceX's willingness to embrace risk was demonstrated
                    by its close collaboration with the Ukrainian government,
                    which exposed Starlink satellites to Russian jamming
                    attacks. Eutelsat was pulled into the war for a different
                    reason. In November, Ukraine's culture minister, Oleksandr
                    Tkachenko, published an article in French newspaper
                    <em>Le Monde</em>, criticizing Eutelsat for continuing to
                    broadcast TV channels that carried Russian propaganda.
                    Berneke did not deny the claims. "We've always had what we
                    call a policy of neutrality," she says. Eutelsat follows
                    guidance issued by French media regulator ARCOM on which
                    channels are and aren't sanctioned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Berneke resists the idea that executives should implement
                    their own sanctions on top of legally binding restrictions—a
                    trend that has been gathering pace since Russia's invasion
                    of its neighbor. Apple, for example, voluntarily halted
                    product sales in Russia following pressure from the
                    Ukrainian government. "We're not going to try to do more
                    ourselves," she says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead she argues that this stance gives the company more
                    legitimacy to push back when regimes, like Iran, do not want
                    some Western channels broadcast locally.

                    broadly defined as undermining public order or causing
                    disorder in public places. The wording of the offense is

                    to six years in prison yesterday after pleading guilty in a
                    New York court to stealing tens of gigabytes of confidential
                    data, demanding a $1.9 million ransom from his former
                    employer, and then publishing the data publicly when his
                    demands were refused.

                  <p>
                    Sharp had asked for no prison time, telling United States
                    District Judge Katherine Polk Failla that the cyberattack
                    was actually an "unsanctioned security drill" that left
                    Ubiquiti "a safer place for itself and for its clients,"

                    Sharp from "resolving outstanding security issues," and
                    Sharp told the judge that this led to an "idiotic
                    hyperfixation" on fixing those security flaws.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, even if that was Sharp's true motivation, Failla
                    did not accept his justification of his crimes, which
                    include wire fraud, intentionally damaging protected
                    computers, and lying to the FBI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It was not up to Mr. Sharp to play God in this
                    circumstance," Failla said.<br />[...]<br />Sharp executed
                    his plan, and he might have gotten away with it if not for a
                    "slip-up" [...] While copying approximately 155 data
                    repositories, an Internet outage temporarily disabled his
                    VPN. When Internet service was restored, unbeknownst to
                    Sharp, Ubiquiti logged his home IP address before the VPN
                    tool could turn back on.

                  <p>Shouting into the wind isn't so ineffective after all.</p>
                  <p>
                    The idiom is commonly used to describe an unsuccessful
                    attempt to communicate. But it's not actually more difficult
                    to shout upwind, says acoustics researcher Ville Pulkki of
                    Aalto University in Espoo, Finland.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sending a sound upwind, against the flow of air, makes the
                    sound louder due to an acoustical effect called convective
                    amplification. Sound sent downwind is quieter. So, if you're
                    yelling upwind, a listener standing in front of you should
                    have no problem hearing you — contrary to popular belief.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The misperception has a simple explanation, Pulkki says.
                    "When you yell against the wind, you hear yourself worse."
                    That's because, in this scenario, your ears are downwind of
                    your mouth. That means your own voice sounds quieter to you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A similar effect occurs when an ambulance goes by.
                    Most people are familiar with the sudden change of pitch of
                    the siren's sound due to the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/doppler-effect-takes-spin"

                    >
                    (<em>SN: 8/2/13</em>). But the siren is also slightly louder
                    when moving toward a stationary observer than it is when
                    it's moving away. When you're bellowing upwind, it's not the
                    source of sound that's moving, but the medium in which the
                    sound travels.

                    infrastructure and orbital debris, want to collaborate and

                    NASA reckons there's more life in Hubble yet – but only if
                    its altitude can be pushed higher to stop it falling and
                    reentering Earth's atmosphere in the mid 2030s. Atmospheric
                    drag has been slowly degrading the satellite's orbit, and it
                    is expected to drop to 500 kilometers above Earth by about
                    2025.

                    (RFI) in December to explore potential solutions from
                    commercial vendors. NASA's not going to spend any money on
                    this, but organizations willing to do the job would receive
                    "technical information and technical consultation," from
                    NASA Goddard.

                    Now Momentus and Astroscale have announced they're willing
                    to collaborate on a potential future servicing mission to
                    shift the Hubble Space Telescope into a safer orbit and

                    support of a major NASA mission," said John Rood, Momentus
                    CEO. "Even at 33, Hubble is fully capable of continuing its
                    mission; where it is aging is in its orbital stability."

                    It's not known what other companies, if any, also responded
                    to NASA's RFI, since the space agency promised to keep the
                    information confidential. Last year, NASA agreed to

                    the technical feasibility of boosting Hubble with SpaceX's

                  <p>
                    Neither that study nor the RFI guarantee that NASA will
                    carry out a Hubble servicing mission, however. The space
                    agency may well decide that, with newer tech in place and
                    future exploration planned, Hubble's days are coming to an
                    end.

                    The BlackLotus bootkit is the first-known real-world malware
                    that can bypass Secure Boot protections, allowing for the
                    execution of malicious code before your PC begins loading
                    Windows and its many security protections. Secure Boot has
                    been enabled by default for over a decade on most Windows
                    PCs sold by companies like Dell, Lenovo, HP, Acer, and
                    others. PCs running Windows 11 must have it enabled to meet
                    the software's system requirements.<br />[...]<br />Additionally,
                    once the fixes have been enabled, your PC will no longer be
                    able to boot from older bootable media that doesn't include

                    This suggests that face recognition ability doesn't change
                    with practice. While repeated exposure to variable images of
                    one person's face can help you to recognize them,
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211037"
                      >professional facial image comparison courses</a
                    >
                    aimed at training face identification ability have not been
                    shown to produce lasting improvements in performance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is, however, an argument for the role of natural
                    ability in face recognition. People known as
                    "super-recognizers" perform far better than the general
                    population at tests of face recognition, and have been used
                    by police forces to identify criminals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, super-recognizers could be asked to look
                    through images of wanted persons and then try to find them
                    in CCTV footage, or match images caught on CCTV to police
                    mugshots. Some of us are just better than others at these
                    types of task.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But why is it so difficult for most of us to recognize an
                    unfamiliar person across different images? We all know that
                    we look different in different pictures—not many of us would
                    choose to use our passport image on a dating website. And
                    this
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2013.800125"
                      >variability in appearance</a
                    >
                    is what makes unfamiliar face matching so difficult.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When we are familiar with someone, we have seen their face
                    many times looking lots of different ways. We have been
                    exposed to a high amount of this "within-person
                    variability", enabling us to put together a stable
                    representation of that familiar person in our minds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In fact, exposure to within-person variability has been
                    shown to be crucial for
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2015.1136656"
                      >learning</a
                    >
                    what a new face looks like. With unfamiliar people, we just
                    haven't seen enough of their variability to reliably decide
                    whether they look like the image in their photo ID.
