                Barnett blew the whistle on alleged safety problems at Boeing
                and had been giving evidence in a lawsuit against the company

                    Boeing whistleblower John Barnett, 62, was found dead in his
                    truck in a hotel parking lot in South Carolina over the
                    weekend.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mr Barnett blew the whistle on alleged safety problems at
                    the aircraft manufacturing giant and had been giving
                    evidence in a lawsuit against the company in recent days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mr Barnett's former employer, Boeing, has responded to
                    his death, saying: "We are saddened by Mr Barnett's passing,
                    and our thoughts are with his family and friends."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In 2019, Mr Barnett alleged that Boeing intentionally
                    used defective parts in its planes and warned that
                    passengers on its 787 Dreamliner might face a lack of oxygen
                    if a sudden decompression occurred.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] His attorney Brian Knowles told TMZ that he had
                    doubts about the circumstances of his death.

                Barnett's whistleblower complaint against the company has been
                pending for several years, according to court documents

                  <p>
                    John Barnett, 62, was a quality manager who retired in 2017
                    after several decades with the company. He died March 9 of
                    what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Barnett's whistleblower complaint has been pending for
                    more than seven years, according to a 2022 order denying
                    Boeing's motion to dismiss the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Barnett originally filed a complaint with the
                    Occupational Safety and Health Administration in January
                    2017 alleging that Boeing retaliated against him. After
                    nearly four years, the agency concluded that there was no
                    retaliation, a decision that Barnett appealed about three
                    years ago. His case has been pending since then, as the two
                    sides have gone through discovery and prehearing motions.

                    The NYPD sent a sweeping subpoena seeking information from
                    the social media account of the president of a New York City
                    police accountability organization in February, records
                    reviewed by Hell Gate show, only to withdraw its subpoena
                    when told they would need to justify the subpoena in court.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Michael Clancy, better known to friends on and off social
                    media as Rabbi, received a notice last month from X,
                    formerly known as Twitter, alerting him to the fact that the
                    NYPD had sent X a subpoena requesting "all records
                    consisting but not limited to all subscriber name(s), Email
                    address(s), Phone number(s), account creation date, IP logs
                    with timestamps (IP address of account logins and logouts),
                    all logs of previous messages sent and received." The
                    subpoena also requested "all videos sent and received,
                    including but not limited to meta-data. exit data about the
                    messages and videos" for the account.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The notification included a copy of the subpoena, which
                    warned X not to tell Clancy of its existence. "You are not
                    to disclose or notify any customer or third party of the
                    existence of this subpoena or that records were provided
                    pursuant to this subpoena," the document read.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But X, following its own corporate policy, told Clancy
                    anyway, and suggested he might want to get some legal
                    representation to fight the subpoena, recommending the
                    American Civil Liberties Union.

                    Banana Pi is now selling a fully built Wi-Fi 6 router with
                    some solid features for just $30 excluding shipping via Ali
                    Express. This router uses OpenWRT firmware and dual-core Arm
                    A9 Processor-based Triductor TR6560 SoC with Triductor's
                    TR5220 WiFi 6 chipset.

                  <p>
                    The company has been selling this WiFi 6 router board on its
                    own, but now you can buy an out-of-box unit that contains an
                    enclosure for the board with six external antennas, Ethernet

                    A new industrial-scale 'sand battery' has been announced for
                    Finland, which packs 1 MW of power and a capacity of up to
                    100 MWh of thermal energy for use during those cold polar
                    winters. The new battery will be about 10 times bigger than
                    a pilot plant that's been running since 2022.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The sand battery, developed by Polar Night Energy, is a
                    clever concept. Basically, it's a big steel silo of sand (or
                    a similar solid material) that's warmed up through a heat
                    exchanger buried in the center, using excess electricity
                    from the grid – say, that generated during a spike from
                    renewable sources, when it's cheap.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That energy can then be stored for months at a time, with
                    reportedly very little loss, before being extracted as heat
                    on demand. This could theoretically be converted back into
                    electricity, although with some energy loss. But Polar Night
                    says that the most efficient method is to just use the heat
                    itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a chilly place like Finland, that means feeding it into
                    the local district heating system, which shares heat
                    produced from industry or energy production through the
                    community. Networks of pipes carry this heat as hot water or
                    steam to warm up houses, buildings, even swimming pools. In
                    this case, the new sand battery would be trialed in the
                    district heating system of the Finnish municipality of
                    Pornainen, run by a company called Loviisan Lämpö.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This new sand battery is expected to stand 13 m (42.7 ft)
                    tall and 15 m (49.2 ft) wide, providing an output power of 1
                    MW and a capacity of 100 MWh. That, the companies claim,
                    equates to a week's worth of Pornainen's heat demands in
                    winter, or a month's worth in summer. By comparison, Polar
                    Night's previous sand battery stands 4 x 7 m (13 x 23 ft),
                    for a nominal power rating of 100 kW and a capacity of 8
                    MWh.

                    Since Broadcom's $61 billion acquisition of VMware closed in
                    November 2023, Broadcom has been charging ahead with major
                    changes to the company's personnel and products. In
                    December, Broadcom began laying off thousands of employees
                    and stopped selling perpetually licensed versions of VMware
                    products, pushing its customers toward more stable and
                    lucrative software subscriptions instead. In January, it
                    ended its partner programs, potentially disrupting sales and
                    service for many users of its products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This week, Broadcom is making a change that is smaller in
                    scale but possibly more relevant for home users of its
                    products: The free version of VMware's vSphere Hypervisor,
                    also known as ESXi,
                    <a href="https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2107518"
                      >is being discontinued</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ESXi is what is known as a "bare-metal hypervisor,"
                    lightweight software that runs directly on hardware without
                    requiring a separate operating system layer in between. ESXi
                    allows you to split a PC's physical resources (CPUs and CPU
                    cores, RAM, storage, networking components, and so on) among
                    multiple virtual machines. ESXi also supports passthrough
                    for PCI, SATA, and USB accessories, allowing guest operating
                    systems direct access to components like graphics cards and
                    hard drives.

                    which would make some of its shares publicly available to
                    buy for the first time.

                    Microsoft is ending support for its Android subsystem in
                    Windows 11 next year. The software giant first announced it
                    was bringing Android apps to Windows 11 with Amazon's
                    Appstore nearly three years ago, but this Windows Subsystem
                    for Android will now be deprecated starting March 5th, 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Microsoft is ending support for the Windows Subsystem for
                    Android" (WSA), reads a new support document from Microsoft.
                    "As a result, the Amazon Appstore on Windows and all
                    applications and games dependent on WSA will no longer be
                    supported beginning March 5, 2025."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you currently use Android apps from the Amazon Appstore,
                    then you'll continue to have access to these past the
                    support cutoff date, but you won't be able to download any
                    new ones once Microsoft makes its Android subsystem end of
                    life next year. [Since] March 6th [2024], Windows 11 users
                    will no longer be able to search for Amazon Appstore or
                    associated Android apps from the Microsoft Store.

                    In the summer months, the researchers found that healthy
                    colonies paid little attention to the pulse as the bees were
                    too busy foraging for food, caring for their young and
                    maintaining the hive. Other than freezing momentarily when
                    they heard it, the bees' response signal was almost absent
                    as they went about their business. The response signal was
                    stronger as winter arrived and then disappeared again with
                    the warmer spring weather. To the researchers, the winter
                    response indicated that the colony was clustered together
                    for warmth and was healthy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the nine colonies the researchers examined developed
                    serious health deterioration and was the only one to
                    consistently exhibit a strong, easily measurable, long-lived
                    buzzing response throughout the summer while the colony was
                    slowly declining. Although they couldn't generalize, the
                    researchers hope this signal might indicate "at least some
                    health disorders, at least in the active season."

                    The third flight test of Starship is targeted to launch
                    Thursday, March 14. The 110-minute test window opens at 7:00
                    a.m. CT (8:00 a.m. ET).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A live webcast of the flight test will begin about 30
                    minutes before liftoff, which you can watch here and on X
                    @SpaceX. As is the case with all developmental testing, the
                    schedule is dynamic and likely to change, so be sure to stay
                    tuned to our X account for updates.

                  <p>
                    Starship's second flight test achieved a number of major
                    milestones and provided invaluable data to continue rapidly
                    developing Starship. Each of these flight tests continue to
                    be just that: a test. They aren't occurring in a lab or on a
                    test stand, but are putting flight hardware in a flight
                    environment to maximize learning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The third flight test aims to build on what we've learned
                    from previous flights while attempting a number of ambitious
                    objectives, including the successful ascent burn of both
                    stages, opening and closing Starship's payload door, a
                    propellant transfer demonstration during the upper stage's
                    coast phase, the first ever re-light of a Raptor engine
                    while in space, and a controlled reentry of Starship. It
                    will also fly a new trajectory, with Starship targeted to
                    splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This new flight path enables
                    us to attempt new techniques like in-space engine burns
                    while maximizing public safety.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This rapid iterative development approach has been the basis
                    for all of SpaceX's major innovative advancements, including
                    Falcon, Dragon, and Starlink. Recursive improvement is
                    essential as we work to build a fully reusable
                    transportation system capable of carrying both crew and
                    cargo to Earth orbit, help humanity return to the Moon, and
                    ultimately travel to Mars and beyond.

                that Google's first self-designed office building has "been
                plagued for months by inoperable or, at best, spotty Wi-Fi,
                according to six people familiar with the matter." A Google
                spokesperson
                <a
                  href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/googles-self-designed-office-swallows-wi-fi-like-the-bermuda-triangle/"
                  >confirmed the problems</a

                and said the company is working on fixing them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bay View opened in May 2022. At launch, Google's VP of Real
                Estate &amp; Workplace Services, David Radcliffe, said the site
                "marks the first time we developed one of our own major
                campuses, and the process gave us the chance to rethink the very
                idea of an office." The result is a wild tent-like structure
                with a striking roofline made up of swooping square sections. Of
                course, it's all made of metal and glass, but the roof shape
                looks like squares of cloth held up by poles—each square section
                has high points on the four corners and sags down in the middle.
                The roof is covered in solar cells and collects rainwater while
                also letting in natural light, and Google calls it the "Gradient
                Canopy."

                    According to one AI engineer assigned to the building, which
                    also houses members of the advertising team, the wonky Wi-Fi
                    has been no help for Google pushing a three day per week
                    return-to-office mandate.

                    "You'd think the world's leading internet company would have
                    worked this out," he said. Like others, he spoke to Reuters
                    on the condition of anonymity because Google has not
                    authorized them to talk about work conditions.

                    the adjoining cafe where the Wi-Fi signal is stronger.

                    generate" supposedly "highly anomalous results" showing that
                    ChatGPT would produce excerpts of NYT articles. [...] But
                    while defending tactics used to prompt ChatGPT to spout
                    memorized training data—including more than 100 NYT
                    articles—NYT pointed to ChatGPT users who have frequently
                    used the tool to generate entire articles to bypass
                    paywalls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the filing, NYT today has no idea how many of
                    its articles were used to train GPT-3 and OpenAI's
                    subsequent AI models, or which specific articles were used,
                    because OpenAI has "not publicly disclosed the makeup of the
                    datasets used to train" its AI models. Rather than setting
                    up a lawsuit, NYT was prompting ChatGPT to discover evidence
                    in attempts to track the full extent of copyright
                    infringement of the tool, NYT argued. [...] "In OpenAI's
                    telling, The Times engaged in wrongdoing by detecting
                    OpenAI's theft of The Times's own copyrighted content,"
                    NYT's court filing said. "OpenAI's true grievance is not
                    about how The Times conducted its investigation, but instead
                    what that investigation exposed: that Defendants built their
                    products by copying The Times's content on an unprecedented
                    scale—a fact that OpenAI does not, and cannot, dispute." On

                      >community page</a
                    >, one paid ChatGPT user complained that OpenAI is "working
                    against the paid users of ChatGPT Plus. This time they're
                    taking away Browsing, because it reads the content of a site
                    that the user asks for? Please, that's what I pay for Plus
                    for."

                  <p>
                    "I know it's no use complaining, because OpenAI is going to
                    increasingly 'castrate' ChatGPT 4," the ChatGPT user
                    continued, "but there's my rant."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NYT argued that public reports of users turning to ChatGPT
                    to bypass paywalls "contradict OpenAI's contention that its
                    products have not been used to serve up paywall-protected
                    content, underscoring the need for discovery" in the
                    lawsuit, rather than dismissal.

                  <p>
                    NYT wants a court to not only award damages for profits lost
                    due to ChatGPT's alleged infringement, but also to order a
                    permanent injunction to stop ChatGPT from infringement. A
                    win for NYT could mean that

                    Even when the two sentences had the same meaning, the models
                    were more likely to apply adjectives like "dirty," "lazy,"
                    and "stupid" to speakers of African American English (AAE)
                    than speakers of Standard American English (SAE). The models
                    associated speakers of AAE with less prestigious jobs (or
                    didn't associate them with having a job at all), and when
                    asked to pass judgment on a hypothetical criminal defendant,
                    they were more likely to recommend the death penalty.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An even more notable finding may be a flaw the study
                    pinpoints in the ways that researchers try to solve such
                    biases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To purge models of hateful views, companies like OpenAI,
                    Meta, and Google use feedback training, in which human
                    workers manually adjust the way the model responds to
                    certain prompts. This process, often called "alignment,"
                    aims to recalibrate the millions of connections in the
                    neural network and get the model to conform better with
                    desired values.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The method works well to combat overt stereotypes, and
                    leading companies have employed it for nearly a decade. If
                    users prompted GPT-2, for example, to name stereotypes about
                    Black people, it was likely to list "suspicious," "radical,"
                    and "aggressive," but GPT-4 no longer responds with those
                    associations, according to the paper.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However the method fails on the covert stereotypes that
                    researchers elicited when using African-American English in
                    their study, which was published on
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00742.pdf">arXiv</a> and
                    has not been peer reviewed. That's partially because
                    companies have been less aware of dialect prejudice as an
                    issue, they say. It's also easier to coach a model not to
                    respond to overtly racist questions than it is to coach it
                    not to respond negatively to an entire dialect.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    says Valentin Hofmann, a researcher at the Allen Institute

                    For more than 45 years, the Voyager 1 spacecraft has been
                    cruising through the cosmos, crossing the boundary of our
                    solar system to become the first human-made object to
                    venture to interstellar space. Iconic in every regard,

                    that has lost its ability to communicate while traveling
                    billions of miles away from home.

                    NASA’s Voyager 1 has been glitching for months,

                      >sending nonsensical data to ground control</a
                    >. Engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have
                    been trying to resolve the issue, but given how far the
                    spacecraft currently is, the process has been extremely
                    slow. Things are looking pretty bleak for the aging mission,
                    which might be nearing the end. Still, NASA isn’t ready to
                    let go of its most distant spacecraft just yet.

                  <p>
                    “The team continues information gathering and are preparing
                    some steps that they’re hopeful will get them on a path to
                    either understand the root of the problem and/or solve it,”
                    a JPL spokesperson told Gizmodo in an email.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The anomaly may have something to do with the spacecraft’s
                    flight data system (FDS). FDS collects data from Voyager’s
                    science instruments, as well as engineering data about the
                    health of the spacecraft and combines them into a single
                    package that’s transmitted to Earth through one of the
                    probe’s subsystems, the telemetry modulation unit (TMU), in
                    binary code.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    FDS and TMU, however, may be having trouble communicating
                    with one another. As a result, TMU has been sending data to
                    mission control in a repeating pattern of ones and zeroes.

                    scary new AI technology and flinched. "WilmerHale... found
                    that the prior Board's decision did not arise out of
                    concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of
                    development, OpenAI's finances, or its statements to

                    occurred after he attempted to remove Helen Toner from

                    because our male ancestors frequently interacted with
                    competitors who were strangers, and they show how we can use
                    evolutionary thinking and research from nonhuman animals to
                    predict and understand how our psychology and behaviors vary
                    across social contexts, including cross-culturally," Puts
                    said. "Male traits such as deep voices and beards are highly
                    socially salient, but this new research shows that the
                    salience of at least one of these traits varies in
                    predictable ways across societies, and it suggests that
                    others, such as beards, do too."

                    also shows that the extent of our attention to voice pitch
                    when making social attributions is variable across societies
                    and responsive to relevant sociocultural variables. In a

                    Scientists have solved the mysterious absence of star-shaped
                    dunes from Earth's geological history for the first time,
                    dating one back thousands of years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Star dunes are massive sand dunes that owe their name
                    to arms that spread from a central peak. These sand
                    pyramids, which look like stars when viewed from above, are
                    widespread in modern deserts including sand seas in Africa,
                    Arabia, China, and North America.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research reveals the oldest parts of the base of the
                    Moroccan dune are 13,000 years old. However, the discovery
                    that it formed rapidly in the last thousand years surprised
                    scientists who had thought larger dunes were far older.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Believed to be the tallest dunes on Earth—with one in the
                    Badain Jaran Desert in China reaching 300 meters high—star
                    dunes are also found elsewhere in the solar system, on Mars
                    and on Saturn's moon Titan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite being common today, star dunes have almost never
                    been found in the geological record. Their absence has
                    bemused scientists as past deserts are a common part of the
                    history of Earth, preserved in rocks deep underground.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Published in the journal Scientific Reports, the new study
                    dated the foundations of a star dune in the southeast of
                    Morocco known as Lala Lallia, meaning "highest sacred point"
                    in the Berber language, to about 13,000 years old.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The dune sits in the Erg Chebbi area of the Sahara Desert
                    close to the border with Algeria, an area featured in TV
                    series like SAS Rogue Heroes and blockbuster films such as
                    The Mummy and Sahara.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research shows that the sand pyramid reached its current
                    100-meter height and 700-meter width due to rapid growth in
                    the past thousand years as it shifted slowly to the west.

                    thousands of requests” to thousands of unique domains that
                    checked for files uploaded by the visitor browsers. Most
                    files reported 404 web errors, an indication that the login
                    using the guessed password failed. Roughly 0.5 percent of
                    cases returned a 200 response code, leaving open the
                    possibility that password guesses may have been successful.
                    On further inspection, only one of the sites was
                    compromised. The others were using non-standard
                    configurations that returned the 200 response, even for
                    pages that weren’t available.

                    Over a four-day span ending Tuesday, Sinegubko recorded more
                    than 1,200 unique IP addresses that tried to download the
                    credentials file. Of those, five addresses accounted for
                    over 85 percent of the requests:

                    Researchers at Ruhr University Bochum explain how it is
                    possible for the small brains of pigeons, parrots and
                    corvids to perform equally well as those of mammals, despite
                    their significant differences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since the late 19th century, it has been a common belief
                    among researchers that high intelligence requires the high
                    computing capacity of large brains. They also discovered
                    that the cerebral cortex as typical of mammals is necessary
                    to analyze and link information in great detail.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Avian brains, by contrast, are very small and lack any
                    structure resembling a cortex. Nevertheless, scientists
                    showed that parrots and corvids are capable of planning for
                    the future, forging social strategies, recognizing
                    themselves in mirrors and building tools. These and similar
                    aptitudes put them on a par with chimpanzees.<br />...<br />The
                    authors of the study show that birds have developed four
                    similar innovations for intelligence during their evolution,
                    independently of mammals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, birds have many more nerve cells in their small
                    brains than previously believed. Corvids in particular place
                    this extra portion of computing capacity in those areas of
                    the brain that are most important for cognition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second reason is that birds have a specialized brain
                    structure that is similar to the prefrontal cortex in
                    mammals and is crucial for abstraction and planning. This
                    brain region is moreover exceptionally large in intelligent
                    birds and mammals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Third, birds and mammals alike have a system that uses the
                    neurotransmitter dopamine to constantly feedback the quality
                    of their decisions to the prefrontal system. As a result,
                    the prefrontal computational processes continuously adapt to
                    changing situations and the success or failure of the
                    decisions of the individual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, birds have independently developed a very similar
                    working memory to temporarily hold things in short-term
                    memory. Like jugglers who constantly keep many balls
                    spinning in the air, birds and mammals use a flexible
                    activity pattern of their nerve cells to keep a lot of
                    information active at the same time
                  </p>

                Can you blame them? It's got to the point I trust an Arduino -
                that I personally program - far more than anything out there.

              <p>
                I believe computers also follow the "Peter Principle". Each new
                update becomes more and more encrusted with layers of fix code
                that no matter how fast the CPU runs, or how much memory one
                has, the "attack surface" grows so immense that deliberately
                hiding secret backdoors and "sleeper cell" code makes vetting
                trusted code nearly impossible.

                So the Chinese don't trust American IT. Gee, I don't trust it
                either!
              </p>
              <p>
                I am sure the Chinese are really fed up with all the nebulous
                terms, conditions, disclaimers, hold harmless, copyright
                violation threats, and the risk of being given the Roku
                treatment, with contracts written in such a manner they can be
                changed after payment clears, enforced by code, then forcing
                whatever terms to continue or consider the investment in the
                proprietary technology a sunk cost.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you need it done right, learn to do it yourself, or forever
                be under the control of someone else who does.

                    The dominance of Microsoft software in the enterprise means
                    cloud infrastructure providers often need to accommodate
                    customers' IT estates that inevitably include Office,
                    Windows, and more. That's software Microsoft ensures is
                    cheaper to run on Microsoft's Azure cloud compared to
                    rivals, according to CISPE, hence that group's unhappiness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    CISPE members are similarly upset about the price of service
                    provider license agreements, arguing Microsoft charges
                    double digit percentages more to run SQL Server Enterprise
                    licensing on non-Azure servers. Again, here's a table from
                    CISPE advancing those claims.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These figures are just the tip of the iceberg," Francisco
                    Mingorance, secretary general of CISPE, told
                    <em>The Register</em>. "This data represents
                    <em>prima facie</em> evidence that Microsoft is acting
                    against fair competition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The unjustified feature and pricing discriminations imposed
                    by Microsoft on its dominant software, Office and Windows,
                    outside of Azure, squeeze the margins of rival cloud
                    infrastructure providers, lock in customers and raise
                    prices."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It is clear that there is a straightforward competition
                    case here and that if these unfair licensing practices are
                    not immediately ended by Microsoft voluntarily, legal and
                    regulatory action should swiftly follow," he declared.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The EU anti-trust team and competition authorities at
                    the US Federal Trade Commission are also running
                    investigations into Microsoft's cloudy licensing offers.

                    Intel is on track to receive $3.5 billion in US CHIPS Act
                    funding to produce advanced semiconductors for American

                    that the x86 giant would receive anywhere from $3-$4
                    billion. This funding, siphoned from the overall $39 billion
                    in CHIPS and Science Act allotment,  would presumably
                    support the development of a "secure enclave," which we
                    understand to be a separate production line dedicated to
                    military chip production.

                    the $3.5 billion will be dispersed over the next three
                    years. The news was tucked away in a spending bill passed by
                    the US House of Reps Wednesday, and will cement Intel as the
                    leading producer of silicon for the defense market.

                    However, it's not like Uncle Sam had much of a choice if it
                    wanted to keep production of military silicon in the US.
                    Intel is so now the only American chipmaker producing
                    leading edge silicon domestically.

                    My brother and his wife got a house. He mentioned it
                    appeared to have a lot of tech installed by the last owner.
                    I told him that was an exciting mystery for the two of us.
                    Whatever speakers and weird smart home junk had been set up,
                    we'd be able to repurpose. But then he moved in. Slowly,
                    over weeks of tech support calls and hours digging through
                    shockingly deep coat closets, we learned that while the old
                    owner was gone, his digital ghost remained. It was lurking
                    in the home's lights and shades and thermostat, turning what
                    should have been a smart home into a very haunted one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I didn't think I'd have to be the IT equivalent of a
                    Ghostbuster when my brother first texted me about it. I've
                    set up multiple smart homes, worked in IT, and currently am
                    surrounded by some of the smartest tech journalists around.
                    As smart home troubleshooting resources go, I have more than
                    the average person.

                    It was no problem walking him through maximizing the
                    performance of the Google Nest Wifi system still in place
                    (including a full factory reset). But then... the trouble
                    started. There were the window shades that always opened at
                    8AM and always closed at sundown. My brother disconnected
                    everything that looked like a hub, and still, operating on
                    some inaccessible internal clock, the shades carried on as
                    they were once programmed to do.

                    own my brother's house did. They walk away and leave it as
                    an adventure for the next person. I know because I've now
                    done it twice myself. I really hope the new renters of my
                    old Brooklyn walk-up appreciate all the 2014 Philips Hue
                    lights I left installed in the basement.

                  kidnappers and pedophiles</a
                >. It's also fueled fears of a 'privacy nightmare' at a time
                when abortion is criminalized:

                <div>
                  <p>
                    The alleged pedophile "LuvEmYoung" had worked to stay
                    anonymous in the chatrooms where he bragged about sexually
                    abusing children. A criminal affidavit said he covered his
                    tracks by using TeleGuard, an encrypted Swiss messaging app,
                    to share a video of himself last month with a sleeping
                    4-year-old boy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the FBI had a new strategy. A foreign law enforcement
                    officer got TeleGuard to hand over a small string of code
                    the company had used to send push alerts — the pop-up
                    notifications that announce instant messages and news
                    updates — to the suspect's phone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An FBI agent then got Google to quickly hand over a list of
                    email addresses this month linked to that code, known as a
                    "push token," and traced one account to a man in Toledo, an
                    affidavit shows. The man, Michael Aspinwall, was charged
                    with sexual exploitation of minors and distribution of child
                    pornography and arrested within a week of the Google
                    request.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The breakthrough relied on a little-known quirk of push
                    alerts, a basic staple of modern phones: Those tokens can be
                    used to identify users and are stored on servers run by
                    Apple and Google, which can hand them over at law
                    enforcement's request.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The data has become prized evidence for federal
                    investigators, who have used push tokens in at least four
                    cases across the country to arrest suspects in cases related
                    to child sexual abuse material and a kidnapping that led to
                    murder, according to a Washington Post review of court
                    records. And law enforcement officials have defended the
                    technique by saying they use court-authorized legal
                    processes that give officers a vital tool they need to hunt
                    down criminals.

                    Belgian beer brewer Duvel says a ransomware attack has
                    brought its facility to a standstill while its IT team works
                    to remediate the damage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Spokesperson Ellen Aarts had a statement on tap for local
                    media on Wednesday: "At 0130 last night, the alarms went off
                    in Duvel's IT department because ransomware had been
                    detected. Production was therefore immediately stopped. It
                    is not yet known when it could start again. We hope today or
                    tomorrow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our IT department immediately intervened and is currently
                    still mapping everything out. They are looking for a
                    solution as quickly as possible."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Other manufacturing organizations hit by ransomware
                    often aren't so lucky and any kind of downtime can be
                    operationally and financially damaging.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's why the industry is such a common target for ransomware
                    miscreants since they know that theoretically, manufacturers
                    are more motivated to pay ransoms quickly, minimizing costly
                    downtime.

                    A 2.9-ton cargo pallet, once used for a critical battery
                    upgrade mission on the International Space Station (ISS), is
                    now approaching the end of its journey and is expected to

                    The pallet, tossed from the ISS in March 2021 by the trusty

                    atmosphere three years after serving its purpose in a major
                    battery replacement project on the station. According to
                    Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer Jonathan McDowell, the pallet

                    Veterinary scientists seem to have unraveled a mystery about
                    why certain dogs simply can’t ever get enough to eat. In
                    research out this week, they found evidence that a common
                    mutation in Labrador retrievers causes them to experience
                    greater hunger than usual while also reducing their
                    metabolic rate, both of which make the dogs predisposed to
                    obesity. The findings might help better understand and treat
                    obesity in both dogs and their owners.

                    Labradors are one of the most popular dog breeds in the
                    world, treasured for their playful energy and their
                    adeptness as a working dog (they’re often used as service
                    dogs). But while labs do live relatively long lives—about 13
                    years on average—they’re also known to have a ravenous
                    appetite and accordingly high rates of obesity.

                  <p>
                    Labs aren’t alone in their plight: Much like humans, dogs in
                    general are experiencing higher rates of obesity. University
                    of Cambridge scientist Eleanor Raffan has been working to
                    unpack the genetics of obesity and metabolic disease in
                    dogs. Her team has especially focused on the Labrador
                    retriever, given its reputation for obesity, and its close
                    relative the flat-coated retriever.

                to take open source licensing past the apparent stalling point
                it has reached on its way towards software freedom. As he noted
                earlier, current licenses are not meeting that goal and
                businesses have either found loophole or just plain been allowed
                to ignore the licensing. A move more towards a contract is
                needed.
              </p>

                <div>
                  <p>
                    At the link below is the first draft of the Post-Open
                    License. This is not yet the product of a qualified
                    attorney, and you shouldn't apply it to your own work yet.
                    There isn't context for this license yet, so some things
                    won't make sense: for example the license is administered by
                    an entity called the "POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION" and I
                    haven't figured out how to structure that organization so
                    that people can trust it. There are probably also terms I
                    can't get away with legally, this awaits work with a lawyer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because the license attempts to handle very many problems
                    that have arisen with Open Source licensing, it's big. It's
                    approaching the size of AGPL3, which I guess is a metric for
                    a relatively modern license, since AGPL3 is now 17 years old

                    Microsoft's AI text-to-image generator, Copilot Designer,
                    appears to be heavily filtering outputs after a Microsoft
                    engineer, Shane Jones, warned that Microsoft has ignored
                    warnings that the tool randomly creates violent and sexual
                    imagery, CNBC

                    Jones told CNBC that he repeatedly warned Microsoft of the
                    alarming content he was seeing while volunteering in
                    red-teaming efforts to test the tool's vulnerabilities.
                    Microsoft failed to take the tool down or implement
                    safeguards in response, Jones said, or even post disclosures
                    to change the product's rating to mature in the Android
                    store.

                      >reported</a
                    >
                    that Jones told the FTC that while Copilot Designer is
                    currently marketed as safe for kids, it's randomly
                    generating an "inappropriate, sexually objectified image of
                    a woman in some of the pictures it creates." And it can also
                    be used to generate "harmful content in a variety of other
                    categories, including: political bias, underage drinking and
                    drug use, misuse of corporate trademarks and copyrights,
                    conspiracy theories, and religion to name a few."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Jones' tests also found that Copilot Designer would
                    easily violate copyrights, producing images of Disney
                    characters, including Mickey Mouse or Snow White. Most
                    problematically, Jones could politicize Disney characters
                    with the tool, generating images of Frozen's main character,
                    Elsa, in the Gaza Strip or "wearing the military uniform of
                    the Israel Defense Forces."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ars was able to generate interpretations of Snow White, but
                    Copilot Designer rejected multiple prompts politicizing
                    Elsa.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If Microsoft has updated the automated content filters, it's
                    likely due to Jones protesting his employer's decisions.
                    [...] Jones has suggested that Microsoft would need to
                    substantially invest in its safety team to put in place the
                    protections he'd like to see. He reported that the Copilot
                    team is already buried by complaints, receiving "more than
                    1,000 product feedback messages every day." Because of this

                    Their findings add to a growing body of evidence that some
                    introduced species including these feral parrots can
                    experience rapid niche shifts beyond what appears to be
                    possible in the forested regions of northern Mexico they
                    evolved in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Artificial irrigation may close the gap between
                    native and introduced climates," the study suggests,
                    "allowing more year-round vegetation in Southern California
                    cities than expected given its natural precipitation
                    levels."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That "urban oasis effect" created by sprinkler watering
                    systems "could partly explain why introduced parrots do not
                    seem to be spreading beyond urban centers," it says. "Their
                    intelligence and behavioral plasticity might further allow
                    them to adapt to urban life."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The look of Southern California's green canopies has changed
                    significantly since the 1950s and '60s, when developers
                    turned up their noses at native oaks and sycamores. They
                    chose instead to landscape their subdivisions, apartment
                    complexes, business parks, shopping centers and roadways
                    with nonnative trees, including sweet gums, camphor,
                    carrotwood, fig, and ficus trees—all favored by parrots.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Red-crowned parrots, whose home range is restricted to
                    the lowlands of northeast Mexico, were first recorded in the
                    Los Angeles area in 1963. Since then, the population has
                    swelled to more than 3,000 birds, the study says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The number of lilac-crowned parrots, which are endemic to
                    tropical lowlands in west Mexico and became established
                    locally in the 1980s, is about 800 birds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Given that both species are considered endangered in their
                    home ranges in Mexico due to habitat loss and trapping for
                    the pet trade, local established flocks have become prized
                    for their conservation potential.

                    [...] The proposed final judgment, which still has to be
                    agreed to by the judge in the case, fully accepts Nintendo's
                    stated position that "Yuzu is primarily designed to
                    circumvent [Nintendo's copy protection] and play Nintendo
                    Switch games" by "using unauthorized copies of Nintendo

                    "ordinary course" of the average Yuzu user's experience may
                    have been an uphill battle in court. Nintendo argued in its
                    lawsuit that "the vast majority of Yuzu users are using Yuzu
                    to play downloaded pirated games in Yuzu," a fact that could
                    have played against the emulator maker at trial even if
                    non-infringing uses for the emulator do exist.

                    [...] The widespread interest in the impact hypothesis
                    outside academia can appear difficult to understand, says
                    Tristan Sturm, a geographer at Queen's University Belfast,
                    who studies apocalyptic narratives and conspiracy theories.
                    "Archaeology is not a superpopular topic," he points out.
                    Nor does grasping the truth about the impact hypothesis have
                    obvious importance for the average person.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] More broadly, the hypothesis' fringe status appeals to
                    those who are experiencing what Sturm calls "conspiracism,"
                    the reflexive distrust of authority figures, including
                    politicians, journalists and, increasingly, scientists. A
                    tendency toward conspiracism does not necessarily mean
                    someone subscribes to actual conspiracy theories, Sturm
                    says; rather, it is a gap in the epistemological immune
                    system through which conspiracy theories enter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the course of publishing this work, though, members
                    of the Comet Research Group say they have encountered signs
                    that their opponents have moved from simply voicing
                    skepticism to actively trying to suppress their research.
                    Despite receiving several favorable peer reviews on a paper
                    submitted to a scientific journal, group leaders told me,
                    the journal's editor summarily rejected it. In response,
                    they started their own scientific journal, called Airbursts
                    and Cratering Impacts, whose editors include West and two
                    other Comet Research Group members. All three assured me
                    that submissions to the journal are peer-reviewed according
                    to the usual best practices; so far, the journal has
                    published six papers from the group.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I began to wonder if, in trying to draw connections between
                    the various oddities that swirled around the Comet Research
                    Group, Boslough was himself falling into a kind of
                    conspiratorial thinking. "I have indeed asked myself that
                    question," he told me. But after careful consideration, he
                    had concluded that he was not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Comet Research Group members predicted to me that skeptics
                    like Boslough could never be persuaded, only waited out.
                    "You know that old saying," West told me. " 'Science
                    advances one funeral at a time.'" During one of my
                    conversations with him, I asked — as I did of nearly
                    everyone I spoke with, on both sides of the issue — whether
                    he ever harbored any doubts. Was there any kind of evidence
                    that might convince him that he was wrong?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a sense, what West and his collaborators think now hardly
                    matters. The hypothesis has already penetrated deeply, and
                    perhaps indelibly, into the public imagination, seemingly on
                    its way to becoming less a matter of truth than a matter of
                    personal and group identity.

                    [...] One concrete example: My team built a machine learning
                    algorithm to predict moral outrage expressions on Twitter.
                    It works really well. It does as well as showing a tweet to
                    a human and asking, "Is this person outraged or not?" In
                    order to train that algorithm, we showed a bunch of tweets
                    to human participants and asked them to say whether this
                    tweet contained outrage. Because we have that ground truth
                    of human perception, we can be reasonably certain that our
                    tool is doing what we want it to do.

                  <p>
                    [...] Once you have multiple models interacting which are
                    not interpretable and might be making errors in a systematic
                    way that you are not able to recognize, that's where we
                    start to get into dangerous territory. Legal scholar
                    <a
                      href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c"

                    >
                    has called this concept "intellectual debt": As soon as you
                    have multiple systems interacting in a complex environment,
                    you can very quickly get to a point where there are errors
                    propagating through the system, but you don't know where
                    they originate because each individual system is not
                    interpretable to the scientists.

                  <p>
                    [...] So much of the discourse around AI pushes this message
                    of inevitability: that AI is here, it is not going away,
                    it's inevitable that this is going to bring us to a bright
                    future and solve all our problems. That message is coming
                    from people who stand to make a lot of money from AI and its
                    uptake all across society, including science. But we decide
                    when and how we are going to use AI tools in our work. This
                    is not inevitable. We just need to be really careful that
                    these tools serve us. We're not saying that they can't.
                    We're just adamant that we need to educate ourselves in the
                    ways that AI introduces epistemic risk to the production of
                    scientific knowledge. Scientists working alone are not going
                    to engineer our way out of those risks.

                    In a groundbreaking discovery, bumblebees have been shown to
                    possess a previously unseen level of cognitive
                    sophistication. A new study, published in Nature, reveals
                    that these fuzzy pollinators can learn complex, multi-step
                    tasks through social interaction, even if they cannot figure
                    them out on their own. This challenges the long-held belief
                    that such advanced social learning is unique to humans, and
                    even hints at the presence of key elements of cumulative
                    culture in these insects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Led by Dr. Alice Bridges and Professor Lars Chittka , the
                    research team designed a two-step puzzle box requiring
                    bumblebees to perform two distinct actions in sequence to
                    access a sweet reward at the end. Training bees to do this
                    was no easy task, and bees had to be helped along by the
                    addition of an extra reward along the way. This temporary
                    reward was eventually taken away, and bees subsequently had
                    to open the whole box before getting their treat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Surprisingly, while individual bees struggled to solve the
                    puzzle when starting from scratch, those allowed to observe
                    a trained "demonstrator" bee readily learned the entire
                    sequence—even the first step—while only getting a reward at
                    the end.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This study demonstrates that bumblebees possess a level of
                    social learning previously thought to be exclusive to
                    humans. They can share and acquire behaviors that are beyond
                    their individual cognitive capabilities: an ability thought
                    to underpin the expansive, complex nature of human culture,
                    and one previously thought to be exclusive to us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr. Bridges says, "This is an extremely difficult task for
                    bees. They had to learn two steps to get the reward, with
                    the first behavior in the sequence being unrewarded. We
                    initially needed to train demonstrator bees with a temporary
                    reward included there, highlighting the complexity."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Yet, other bees learned the whole sequence from social
                    observation of these trained bees, even without ever
                    experiencing the first step's reward. But when we let other
                    bees attempt to open the box without a trained bee to
                    demonstrate the solution, they didn't manage to open any at
                    all."

                        Parag Agrawal sues Elon Musk: Former Twitter CEO Parag
                        Agrawal and three other ex-executives have suited
                        company boss Elon Musk for $128 million in unpaid

                        withhold their severance payments of around $200
                        million. This happened after Elon Musk took over the

                    Researchers have shown that inedible species of butterfly
                    that mimic each others' color patterns have also evolved
                    similar flight behaviors to warn predators and avoid being
                    eaten.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is well known that many inedible species of butterfly
                    have evolved near identical color patterns, which act as
                    warning signals to predators so the butterflies avoid being
                    eaten.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers have now shown that these butterflies have not
                    only evolved similar color patterns, but that they have also
                    evolved similar flight behaviors, which together make a more
                    effective warning signal to predators. The article is

                    in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of
                    Sciences.

                    Using high-speed video footage to record the flight of wild
                    butterflies in South America, researchers at the University
                    of York measured the wing beat frequency and wing angles of
                    351 butterflies, representing 38 species each belonging to
                    one of 10 distinct color pattern mimicry groups.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using this dataset they investigated how the flight patterns
                    of butterflies are related to factors such as habitat, wing
                    shape, temperature and which color pattern mimicry group the
                    butterfly belongs to see which elements most heavily
                    affected flight behavior.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although the species habitat and wing shape were expected to
                    have the greatest influence on flight behavior, the
                    researchers found that in fact the biggest determinant of
                    flight behavior was the color pattern mimicry group a
                    butterfly belonged to.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This means that distantly-related butterflies belonging to
                    the same color pattern mimicry group have more similar
                    flight behavior than closely-related species that display
                    different warning coloration. To a predator, the butterflies
                    would not only look the same through their color patterns,
                    but would also move in the same way.

                    [...] <br />imagery from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance
                    Orbiter, which flew over the landing site, Intuitive
                    Machines has determined that the lander came down to the
                    surface and likely skidded. This force caused one of its six
                    landing legs to snap. Then, for a couple of seconds, the
                    lander stood upright before toppling over due to the failed
                    leg.<br />[...]<br />"The question is, do you want to limp
                    along and stay alive with everything shut off?" Altemus
                    said. "Or do you want to go on the Quasonix, when you have
                    the big ear listening, and get all the data you can? And
                    that's the decision we made, to go get all the data. It's
                    not how long you stay alive. It's how much information you
                    glean from this mission."<br />[...]<br />In thinking back
                    over the 12 days since the Intuitive Machines lander
                    launched on a Falcon 9 rocket, Altemus said the mission
                    experienced 11 crises. The first of these happened shortly
                    after the Falcon 9 rocket's upper stage released the
                    spacecraft into a translunar injection. The star trackers on
                    board the spacecraft failed.<br />[...]<br />If one assumes
                    there is a 70 percent chance of recovering from any one of
                    these crises but you have to address 11 different crises on
                    the way to the Moon, the probability of mission success is
                    less than 2 percent.

                    The secret to making delicious chocolate with less added
                    sugar is oat flour, according to a new study by Penn State
                    researchers. In a blind taste test, recently published in

                      >Journal of Food Science</a
                    >, 25% reduced-sugar chocolates made with oat flour were
                    rated equally, and in some cases preferred, to regular
                    chocolate. The findings provide a new option for decreasing
                    chocolate's sugar content while maintaining its texture and
                    flavor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We were able to show that there is a range in which you can
                    manage a sizable reduction in added sugar and people won't
                    notice and don't care, in terms of liking," said John Hayes,
                    professor of food science at Penn State and corresponding
                    author on the study. "We're never going to make chocolate
                    healthy, because it's an indulgence, but we can successfully
                    take out some of the sugar for consumers who are trying to
                    reduce their intake of added sugars."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hayes explained that chocolate is about half sugar by
                    weight, with the rest being fat and cocoa solids, so
                    reducing the amount of sugar by any amount can drastically
                    alter the texture and flavor profile of the chocolate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The function of sugar in chocolate is both sweetness and
                    bulking, so if we take that sugar out, we have to put
                    something else in that will do the job just as well, or
                    consumers will notice," said Gregory Ziegler, distinguished
                    professor of food science at Penn State and co-author on the
                    study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Our results suggest we can cut back 25% of added
                    sugar to chocolate, effectively reducing the total sugar by
                    13.5%, if we substitute oat flour," said Kai Kai Ma, a
                    doctoral candidate in food science at Penn State and
                    co-author on the paper. "That addition of oat flour is
                    unlikely to meaningfully impact consumer acceptability,
                    which is great news."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "I'm a big believer in meeting consumers where they
                    are," Hayes said. "We've tried for 40 years to tell people
                    to eat less sugar and it doesn't work because people want to
                    eat what they want to eat. So instead of making people feel
                    guilty, we need to meet people where they are and figure out
                    how to make food better while still preserving the pleasure
                    from food."

                    Spain has moved to block Sam Altman's cryptocurrency project
                    Worldcoin, the latest blow to a venture that has raised
                    controversy in multiple countries by collecting customers'
                    personal data using an eyeball-scanning "orb."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The AEPD, Spain's data protection regulator, has demanded
                    that Worldcoin immediately ceases collecting personal
                    information in the country via the scans and that it stops
                    using data it has already gathered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The regulator announced on Wednesday that it had taken the
                    "precautionary measure" at the start of the week and had
                    given Worldcoin 72 hours to demonstrate its compliance with
                    the order.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Worldcoin has registered 4 million users, according to
                    a person with knowledge of the matter. Investors poured
                    roughly $250 million into the company, including venture
                    capital groups Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures,
                    internet entrepreneur Reid Hoffman and, prior to the
                    collapse of his FTX empire, Sam Bankman-Fried.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The project attracted media attention and prompted a handful
                    of consumer complaints in Spain as queues began to grow at
                    the stands in shopping centers where Worldcoin is offering
                    cryptocurrency in exchange for eyeball scans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "I want to send a message to young people. I
                    understand that it can be very tempting to get €70 or €80
                    that sorts you out for the weekend," España Martí said, but
                    "giving away personal data in exchange for these derisory
                    amounts of money is a short, medium and long-term risk."

                So, just a follow up. According to matt, we got around $2,000
                USD right now in the PBC overnight, and there are still more
                payments processing. I paid the Linode bill this morning. So,
                funding problem: solved. We should be set for the foreseeable
                future as far as money goes!

                Seriously guys, you stepped up, and I am thankful. Since I'm
                here, a quick update on what's going on: Right now, we're mostly
                just waiting for paperwork to go through as far as handing the
                site to a newly-created, not-for-profit. It's slow work and I'm
                not directly involved, but I've seen that there has been a fair
                number of articles on the subject so I'm pretty happy that
                everyone is aware of what's going on.
              </p>
              <p>
                I could write more, but I think I'm going to keep this short and
                sweet for now. Once I have a final total, I'll post it.

                    Oregon has joined the small but growing list of states that
                    have passed right-to-repair legislation. Oregon's bill
                    stands out for a provision that would prevent companies from
                    requiring that official parts be unlocked with encrypted
                    software checks before they will fully function.

                    >
                    passed Oregon's House by a 42 to 13 margin. Gov. Tina Kotek
                    has five days to sign the bill into law. Consumer groups and
                    right-to-repair advocates praised the bill as "the best bill
                    yet," while the bill's chief sponsor, state Sen. Janeen
                    Sollman (D), pointed to potential waste reductions and an
                    improved second-hand market for closing a digital divide.

                    "Oregon improves on Right to Repair laws in California,
                    Minnesota and New York by making sure that consumers have
                    the choice of buying new parts, used parts, or third-party
                    parts for the gadgets and gizmos," said Gay Gordon-Byrne,
                    executive director of Repair.org, in a statement.

                    Modern Arts is now using Lore Machine to develop a fictional
                    universe for a manga series based on text written by the
                    creator of Netflix's <em>Love, Death &amp; Robots</em>.

                  <p>
                    Under the hood, Lore Machine is built from familiar parts. A
                    large language model scans your text, identifying
                    descriptions of people and places as well as its overall
                    sentiment. A version of Stable Diffusion generates the
                    images. What sets it apart is how easy it is to use. Between
                    uploading my story and downloading its storyboard, I clicked
                    maybe half a dozen times.

                    that hide the stunning power of generative models behind a
                    one-click web interface. "It's a lot of work to stay current
                    with new AI tools, and the interface and workflow for each
                    tool is different," says Ben Palmer, CEO of the New Computer
                    Corporation, a content creation firm. "Using a mega-tool
                    with one consistent UI is very compelling. I feel like this
                    is where the industry will land."

                    Campion set up the company behind Lore Machine two years ago
                    to work on a blockchain version of Wikipedia. But when he
                    saw how people took to generative models, he switched
                    direction. Campion used the free-to-use text-to-image model
                    Midjourney to make a comic-book version of Samuel Taylor
                    Coleridge's <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em>. It
                    went viral, he says, but it was no fun to make.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "My wife hated that project," he says. "I was up to four in
                    the morning, every night, just hammering away, trying to get
                    these images right." The problem was that text-to-image
                    models like Midjourney generate images one by one. That
                    makes it hard to maintain consistency between different
                    images of the same characters. Even locking in a specific
                    style across multiple images can be hard. "I ended up
                    veering toward a trippier, abstract expression," says
                    Campion.

                Linux (and sometimes GNU/Linux) dominates fully in all other
                areas: servers, routers, various embedded devices (cars,
                televisions, lawn mowers, etc), mobile phones, interplanetary
                satellites, and supercomputers. The desktop is the last
                remaining market, albeit a highly symbolic one. As usual, it is
                way too early to speculate about "year of the Linux desktop".
                However, when one can (once again) walk into a big box store and
                buy a GNU/Linux system off the shelf, that market can be
                considered won over.

                  <p>
                    ...<br />When the researchers first did this experiment with
                    American college students as the test subjects, they found
                    that people tended to produce time intervals that are
                    related by simple integer ratios. Furthermore, most of the
                    rhythms they produced, such as those with ratios of 1:1:2
                    and 2:3:3, are commonly found in Western music.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers then went to Bolivia and asked members of
                    the Tsimane' society to perform the same task. They found
                    that Tsimane' also produced rhythms with simple integer
                    ratios, but their preferred ratios were different and
                    appeared to be consistent with those that have been
                    documented in the few existing records of Tsimane' music.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "At that point, it provided some evidence that there might
                    be very widespread tendencies to favor these small integer
                    ratios and that there might be some degree of cross-cultural
                    variation. But because we had just looked at this one other
                    culture, it really wasn't clear how this was going to look
                    at a broader scale," Jacoby says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Just as they had in their original 2017 study, the
                    researchers found that in every group they tested, people
                    tended to be biased toward simple integer ratios of rhythm.
                    However, not every group showed the same biases. People from
                    North America and Western Europe, who have likely been
                    exposed to the same kinds of music, were more likely to
                    generate rhythms with the same ratios.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, many groups, for example, those in Turkey, Mali,
                    Bulgaria, and Botswana, showed a bias for other rhythms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There are certain cultures where there are particular
                    rhythms that are prominent in their music, and those end up
                    showing up in the mental representation of rhythm," Jacoby
                    says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers believe their findings reveal a mechanism
                    that the brain uses to aid in the perception and production
                    of music.

                    That idea is inspiring a new approach to managing plasma,
                    the super-hot state of matter, for use as a power source.
                    Scientists are using the imperfections in magnetic fields
                    that confine a reaction to improve and enhance the plasma in
                    an approach outlined in a paper in the journal Nature
                    Communications.

                    "This approach allows you to maintain a high-performance
                    plasma, controlling instabilities in the core and the edge
                    of the plasma simultaneously. That simultaneous control is
                    particularly important and difficult to do. That's what
                    makes this work special," said Joseph Snipes of the U.S.
                    Department of Energy's (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics
                    Laboratory (PPPL). He is PPPL's deputy head of the Tokamak
                    Experimental Science Department and was a co-author of the
                    paper.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    PPPL Physicist Seong-Moo Yang led the research team, which
                    spans various institutions in the U.S. and South Korea. Yang
                    says this is the first time any research team has validated
                    a systematic approach to tailoring magnetic field
                    imperfections to make the plasma suitable for use as a power
                    source. These magnetic field imperfections are known as
                    error fields.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Error fields are typically caused by minuscule defects
                    in the magnetic coils of the device that holds the plasma,
                    which is called a tokamak. Until now, error fields were only
                    seen as a nuisance because even a very small error field
                    could cause a plasma disruption that halts fusion reactions
                    and can damage the walls of a fusion vessel. Consequently,
                    fusion researchers have spent considerable time and effort
                    meticulously finding ways to correct error fields.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This study demonstrates that adjusting the error
                    fields can simultaneously stabilize both the core and the
                    edge of the plasma. By carefully controlling the magnetic
                    fields produced by the tokamak's coils, the researchers
                    could suppress edge instabilities, also known as edge
                    localized modes (ELMs), without causing disruptions or a
                    substantial loss of confinement.
