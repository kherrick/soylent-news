                    Despite the success of the two tests, there is concern that
                    Starship could end up delaying NASA’s Artemis missions.
                    Earlier in June, NASA’s Associate Administrator Jim Free
                    said that

                      delays</a
                    >. Free’s concern followed Starship’s first test flight in
                    April, which ended with the rocket exploding in the skies.

                    The space agency has a dozen RS-25 engines taken from
                    retired Space Shuttles and modified for use on the SLS core
                    stage, four engines have already been used for the Artemis 1
                    mission in 2022. The four engines are located at the base of
                    the rocket’s core stage, and will fire non-stop for over
                    eight minutes during launch and flight.

              <p>
                I *just* realized that an editor on SoylentNews, janrinok (AKA
                JR), has very recently attained a huge milestone on our site:
              </p>
              <h1><b>8,000 stories!</b></h1>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                I can speak from personal experience that this represents a HUGE
                sacrifice of time and energy. He showed me the ropes in how to
                post a story. (There is FAR MORE than meets the eye to be an
                editor!) There was also the fact that in the early years of
                SoylentNews, he was simultaneously taking care of his severely
                ill wife. (She, sadly, passes away a few short years ago.) He
                endured some exceedingly heart-wrenching periods doing this. I
                have witnessed him posting stories even though he was beyond the
                point of exhaustion. So much so that his doctors *demanded* that
                he stop *everything* and take a break for many months.
              </p>
              <p>
                So it may not appear to be a huge milestone, please take my word
                for it. It is!

                  <p>
                    Containers, such as those used with Distrobox, enable users
                    to launch applications in a separate environment with full
                    write access. This approach is useful for applications that
                    must interact with the system at a deeper level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immutable distributions handle updates differently from
                    traditional ones. Updates are never applied in place;
                    instead, they create a new bootable system image. This
                    approach ensures that users always have access to the
                    previous version if issues arise after an update. While this
                    requires reboots, it enhances system stability and security.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immutable distributions introduce complexity, especially for
                    users accustomed to traditional Linux distributions or other
                    operating systems like Windows or macOS. Basic tasks like
                    installing packages, updating, and manually editing config
                    files differ significantly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immutable distributions require users to adapt to new ways
                    of performing familiar tasks. Installing packages, updating
                    the system, and even manually editing configuration files
                    may involve unfamiliar processes. This learning curve can be
                    steep for those new to this approach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immutable distributions may not suit users who value the
                    ability to access and modify any file at any time. The
                    restrictions imposed by these distributions can be seen as
                    limiting, especially when compared to traditional Linux
                    distributions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immutable distributions offer unique benefits, making them a
                    valuable option, particularly for server environments and
                    specialized appliances. However, their limitations and
                    complexity may hinder their adoption among regular desktop
                    users. While they won't replace traditional Linux
                    distributions, they will likely coexist, catering to
                    different use cases and preferences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In conclusion, immutable distributions represent a promising
                    evolution of Linux operating systems, emphasizing security,
                    reliability, and ease of maintenance. Whether they become
                    the standard or remain a niche choice depends on individual
                    needs and priorities. Immutable distributions offer an
                    alternative approach to Linux, one that can be better suited
                    to specific scenarios but may not be the right fit for
                    everyone.

                    Less than a week after the cross-platform game engine maker
                    Unity announced its big plan to charge developers based on
                    the number of installations and revenue, the company said
                    it’s rolling back its plans to some extent, though
                    developers may already be too burned to even consider what
                    limp olive branch the company could be offering.

                    was first proposed on Sept. 12th and would force fees on any
                    project that makes $200,000 in a 12-month period or has
                    200,000-lifetime game installs for those who subscribe to
                    the cheaper engine subscription plans. Those companies
                    paying for the higher-end Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise
                    plans had to reach either $1 million in revenue or 1 million
                    lifetime installs before they paid a fee.

                    On Sunday, Unity posted a

                    saying “We apologize for the confusion and angst,” regarding
                    its big plan to force devs to pay more when they succeed.
                    Unity said it was “listening” to the critique, adding it
                    would share an update in a few days describing its new
                    proposed runtime fee. The same notice was plastered at the

                    Unity’s plans to skim additional money off the top from
                    Unity developers did not exactly engender goodwill with the
                    people who put the software to use. Those subscribing to the
                    cheaper Unity Personal or Unity Plus plans would have been
                    forced to pay $.20 for every game installed past the
                    threshold. Those larger companies paying more would have to
                    fork over between $.02 and $.125 for every install.
                    <em>Rust</em> developer Garry Newman, who developed his game
                    in Unity nearly 10 years ago,

                    his Facepunch Studios would owe the company $410,000 based
                    on the number of installs.

                    showed that Unity would charge per install, even if it was
                    the same user simply re-installing the game, or installing
                    on a separate device.

                    [...] There’s no word on what changes Unity plans to make to
                    its fee structure, but for many devs, the damage is already
                    done. Newman wrote on his company’s

                    “We used the engine because you pay [upfront] and then ship
                    your product,” Newman wrote. “We weren’t told this was going
                    to happen. We weren’t warned. We weren’t consulted… We can
                    see what they can and are willing to do. You can’t un-ring

                    A cyber criminal gang proficient in impersonation and
                    malware has been identified as the likely culprit for an
                    attack that paralized networks at US casino operator MGM

                    The group, which security researchers call "Scattered
                    Spider," uses fraudulent phone calls to employees and help
                    desks to "phish" for login credentials. It has targeted MGM
                    and dozens of other Western companies with the aim of
                    extracting ransom payments, according to two people familiar

                    Chandrayaan means "moon vehicle" in Hindi and Sanskrit. The
                    vehicle took off from a launch pad in southern India on July
                    14 and completed a 'soft landing' on the moon nine days
                    later. A soft landing is when the space shuttle is kept
                    intact.

                  <p>
                    Attempts by various space agencies have been made to land on
                    the south pole of the moon, but it's notoriously difficult
                    to do, thanks to rugged terrain, extreme temperatures, lack
                    of light and communication difficulties.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Humans have been landing on the equator of the moon for
                    more than half a century," says Dr. McKemmish. "And while a
                    soft landing is always more technical, when the landscape is
                    more cratered, such as it is at the south pole, that landing
                    becomes even harder. There's also increased complexities
                    with communication at the poles, compared to the equator."

                    Chandrayaan–3 will be running a series of experiments
                    including a spectrometer analysis of the mineral composition
                    of the lunar surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Generally a moon rover will be digging up samples, taking
                    lots of photos, and taking various spectral readings
                    investigating how the material interacts with light," says
                    Dr. McKemmish.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For this mission, the spectroscopic technique used is
                    basically focusing a laser on the surface, causing the moon
                    rocks to become a plasma. This plasma emits colors of light
                    depending on its composition and thus this measurement tells

                    In a controversial bid to expose supposed bias in a top
                    journal, a US climate expert shocked fellow scientists by
                    revealing he tailored a wildfire study to emphasize global
                    warming.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While supporters applauded Patrick T. Brown for flagging
                    what he called a one-sided climate "narrative" in academic
                    publishing, his move surprised at least one of his
                    co-authors—and angered the editors of leading journal
                    <i>Nature</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I left out the full truth to get my climate change paper
                    published," read the headline to an article signed by Brown
                    in the news site The Free Press on September 5.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said he deliberately focused on the impact from higher
                    temperatures on wildfire risk in a study in the journal,
                    excluding other factors such as land management.
                  </p>

                    in <i>Nature</i> because I stuck to a narrative I knew the
                    editors would like," the article read. "That's not the way
                    science should work."

                  <p>
                    One of the named co-authors of the study, Steven J. Davis, a
                    professor in the earth system science department at the
                    University of California, Irvine, told AFP Brown's comments
                    took him "by surprise".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Patrick may have made decisions that he thought would help
                    the paper be published, but we don't know whether a
                    different paper would have been rejected," he said in an
                    email.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I don't think he has much evidence to support his strong
                    claims that editors and reviewers are biased."

                  <p>
                    [...] "It is unfortunate, but not surprising, that Patrick
                    felt like he had to be a willing participant in
                    oversimplifying his work to have a career in science. In
                    that long run, that is not a service to him, the field, or

                    Browsing the Asian marketplaces online is always an
                    experience. Sometimes, you see things at ridiculously low
                    prices. Other times, you see things and wonder who is buying
                    them and why — a shrimp pillow? But sometimes, you see
                    something that probably could have a more useful purpose
                    than the proposed use case.

                    listings. As you might expect, though, someone has
                    reverse-engineered the protocol, and there is

                    internet," Kelley told <em>The Register</em>. "Most people
                    have no idea how much of their information has been compiled
                    or shared by data brokers and ad tech companies, and have
                    little ability to erase it."

                    It's an interesting twist. Sherlock seems designed to use

                    [...] The good news for some, at least: it likely poses a
                    minimal threat to most people, considering the
                    multi-million-dollar price tag and other requirements for
                    developing a surveillance campaign using Sherlock, Kelley
                    noted.

                    Still, "it's just one more way that spyware companies can
                    surveil and target activists, reporters, and government
                    officials," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Data finds its way to being used for surveillance,
                    and worse, all the time," he continued. "Stop making the
                    data collection profitable, and this goes away. If
                    behavioral advertising were banned, the industry wouldn't
                    exist."

                    California has become the third US state to pass a
                    right-to-repair bill for consumer electronics. After a
                    unanimous vote in favor, Sacramento lawmakers expect
                    Governor Gavin Newsom to sign the bill into law.

                    and $100, manufacturers must provide consumers and
                    independent repair shops with replacement parts and repair
                    manuals for three years after the initial manufacture date.
                    That timespan extends to seven years for devices costing
                    over $100. Although the law goes into effect on July 1,
                    2024, it applies retroactively to products manufactured
                    after July 1, 2021.

                  <p>
                    The law mainly applies to devices like phones, tablets,
                    laptops, and other general-purpose appliances, but not alarm
                    systems or video game consoles. Although manufacturers
                    extracted fewer concessions in California than Minnesota or
                    New York, a few significant ones remain.

                  <p>
                    First, the bill doesn't require companies to provide
                    instructions for bypassing security measures, which can
                    often prove a significant obstacle to independent repairs.

                    is notorious for using software locks to force users to
                    spend extra money on first-party maintenance and

                  <p>
                    Another caveat to the California bill is that independent
                    repair vendors must disclose when they use refurbished
                    replacement parts or originate components from third-party
                    makers. This condition could affect how companies handle
                    issues such as official repairs or warranties.

                    After spending decades on pharmacy shelves, the leading
                    nasal decongestant in over-the-counter cold and allergy
                    medicines has met its downfall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Advisers for the Food and Drug Administration this week
                    voted unanimously, 16 to 0, that oral doses of
                    phenylephrine—found in brand-name products like Sudafed PE,
                    Benadryl Allergy Plus Congestion, Mucinex Sinus-Max, and
                    Nyquil Severe Cold &amp; Flu—are not effective at treating a

                  <p>
                    The vote was years in the making. In 2007, amid doubts, FDA
                    advisers called for more studies. With the data that has
                    trickled in since then, the agency's own scientists
                    conducted a careful review and came to the firm conclusion

                    Schumer, who has made AI one of his top issues as leader,
                    said regulation of artificial intelligence will be "one of
                    the most difficult issues we can ever take on," and he
                    listed some of the reasons why: It's technically
                    complicated, it keeps changing and it "has such a wide,
                    broad effect across the whole world," he said.

                    Sparked by the release of ChatGPT less than a year ago,
                    businesses have been clamoring to apply new generative AI
                    tools that can compose human-like passages of text, program
                    computer code and create novel images, audio and video. The
                    hype over such tools has accelerated worries over its
                    potential societal harms and prompted calls for more
                    transparency in how the data behind the new products is
                    collected and used.

                    Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who led the
                    meeting with Schumer, said Congress needs to get ahead of
                    fast-moving AI by making sure it continues to develop "on
                    the positive side" while also taking care of potential
                    issues surrounding data transparency and privacy.

                    "AI is not going away, and it can do some really good things
                    or it can be a real challenge," Rounds said.

                    The tech leaders and others outlined their views at the
                    meeting, with each participant getting three minutes to
                    speak on a topic of their choosing. Schumer and Rounds then
                    led a group discussion.

                    During the discussion, according to attendees who spoke
                    about it, Musk and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt raised
                    existential risks posed by AI, and Zuckerberg brought up the
                    question of closed vs. "open source" AI models. Gates talked
                    about feeding the hungry. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna expressed
                    opposition to proposals favored by other companies that

                    In terms of a potential new agency for regulation, "that is
                    one of the biggest questions we have to answer and that we
                    will continue to discuss," Schumer said. Musk said afterward
                    he thinks the creation of a regulatory agency is likely.

                    Outside the meeting, Google CEO Pichai declined to give
                    details about specifics but generally endorsed the idea of
                    Washington involvement.

                    on the innovation side and building the right safeguards,
                    and I thought it was a productive discussion," he said.

                    Some senators were critical that the public was shut out of
                    the meeting, arguing that the tech executives should testify
                    in public.

                    Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he would not attend what he
                    said was a "giant cocktail party for big tech." Hawley has
                    introduced legislation with Sen. Richard Blumenthal,
                    D-Conn., to require tech companies to seek licenses for
                    high-risk AI systems.

                    "I don't know why we would invite all the biggest
                    monopolists in the world to come and give Congress tips on
                    how to help them make more money and then close it to the
                    public," Hawley said.

                    While civil rights and labor groups were also represented at
                    the meeting, some experts worried that Schumer's event
                    risked emphasizing the concerns of big firms over everyone
                    else.

                    Sarah Myers West, managing director of the nonprofit AI Now
                    Institute, estimated that the combined net worth of the room
                    Wednesday was $550 billion and it was "hard to envision a
                    room like that in any way meaningfully representing the
                    interests of the broader public." She did not attend.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the United States, major tech companies have expressed
                    support for AI regulations, though they don't necessarily
                    agree on what that means. Similarly, members of Congress
                    agree that legislation is needed, but there is little
                    consensus on what to do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is also division, with some members of Congress
                    worrying more about overregulation of the industry while
                    others are concerned more about the potential risks. Those
                    differences often fall along party lines.

                and many other places, the 2023 Ig Nobel winners have been
                announced.

                The Ig Nobel Prize celebrates the most trivial and ridiculous
                things our best and brightest have studied. The 2023 award
                winners are now world-class experts that have advanced mankind's
                knowledge on big questions. Questions like "how much do horny
                anchovies influence ocean water mixing?" Or "if a group of
                people stand in the street looking upward, does the size of the
                group influence how many unrelated passers-by also decide to
                look up?" Or that old chestnut, "do we need toilets that analyze
                our excreta and identify us by taking photos of our anuses?"
              </p>
              <p>

                    For hundreds of years, we have been told what Newton's First
                    Law of Motion supposedly says, but recently a paper
                    published in Philosophy of Science (preprint) by [Daniel
                    Hoek] argues that it is based on a mistranslation of the
                    original Latin text. As noted by [Stephanie Pappas] in
                    Scientific American, this would seem to be a rather academic
                    matter as Newton's Laws of Motion have been superseded by
                    General Relativity and other theories developed over the
                    intervening centuries. Yet even today Newton's theories are
                    highly relevant, as they provide very accessible
                    approximations for predicting phenomena on Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similarly, we owe it to scientific and historical accuracy
                    to address such matters, all of which seem to come down to
                    an awkward translation of Isaac Newton's original Latin text
                    in the 1726 third edition to English by Andrew Motte in
                    1729. This English translation is what ended up defining for
                    countless generations what Newton's Laws of Motion said,
                    along with the other chapters in his Philosophiæ Naturalis
                    Principia Mathematica.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1999 a new translation (Cohen-Whitman translation) was
                    published by a team of translators, which contains a number
                    of notable departures from the 1729 translation. Most
                    notable herein is the change of the original (Motte)
                    translation:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of
                        uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled
                        to change that state by forces impress'd thereon.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>to the following in the Cohen-Whitman translation:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or
                        of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as
                        it is compelled to change its state by the forces
                        impressed.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    This more correct translation of the Latin nisi quatenus has
                    significant implications for the law's effects, as while
                    Newton's version does not require force-free bodies, the
                    weak reading introduced by Motte's translation incites
                    exactly the kind of debate which has been seen over the
                    centuries about why the First Law even exists, when in this
                    translated form it automatically follows from the Second
                    Law, rendering it redundant.

                  <p>
                    The three-judge appeals panel said nine of the lower court's
                    ten prohibitions were vague and overly broad at this stage
                    of the litigation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Prohibitions one, two, three, four, five, and seven
                    prohibit the officials from engaging in, essentially, any
                    action 'for the purpose of urging, encouraging, pressuring,
                    or inducing' content moderation," the appeals panel said.
                    "But 'urging, encouraging, pressuring' or even 'inducing'
                    action does not violate the Constitution unless and until
                    such conduct crosses the line into coercion or significant
                    encouragement."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And citing problems with prohibitions eight, nine and ten,
                    they vacated all save for the sixth, which they modified to
                    state that government officials or their agents can take "no
                    actions, formal or informal, directly or indirectly, to
                    coerce or significantly encourage social-media companies to
                    remove, delete, suppress, or reduce, including through
                    altering their algorithms, posted social-media content
                    containing protected free speech."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not all speech in the US is protected, so this injunction –
                    in place while the case is being heard – does not apply to
                    government communication to social media companies about:
                    incitement to imminent unlawful action; harassment; credible
                    threats; defamation; obscenity and child pornography; among

                    ordinary government functions is really murky, and this
                    opinion doesn't really try to clarify that," Santa Clara
                    University’s Goldman told <em>The Register</em> in a phone
                    interview.

                    "They simply decide some things are impermissible. Other
                    things are okay. And that makes the rule from the case
                    impossible to operationalize, for the government and
                    possibly for the services. Nobody exactly knows what they're

                    [...] "The court said it is impermissible for the government
                    to commandeer content moderation practices," he said. "But
                    that's exactly what the

                    social media censorship laws did. They literally overrode
                    the social media companies' editorial discretion via
                    government edict.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "And thus, the Fifth Circuit, the same court,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/16/texas_social_media_law_appeal/"

                    those interventions, saying that was constitutionally
                    permissible for the government to dictate content moderation
                    operations. In other words, this opinion is in
                    irreconcilable tension with the Fifth Circuit's earlier
                    opinion on the social media censorship laws."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also, Goldman observed that the Fifth Circuit seems to be
                    saying that these social media companies risk becoming state
                    actors by engaging with government officials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, with regard to platform cooperation in limiting
                    health misinformation, there's passage in the opinion that
                    says, "In sum, we find that the White House officials, in
                    conjunction with the Surgeon General's office, coerced and
                    significantly encouraged the platforms to moderate content.
                    As a result, the platforms’ actions 'must in law be deemed
                    to be that of the State.'"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That's a huge problem for the government," he continued.
                    "If internet companies become state actors, then they cannot
                    report information about their users to law enforcement
                    unless they comply with all the laws on criminal procedure."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As an example, Goldman cited how the government requires
                    internet services to provide data about child sexual abuse
                    material. If those companies become state actors through
                    government intervention, he said, then those reports become
                    impermissible evidence because they haven't been done in
                    compliance with legal rules that constrain the government.

                    The modus operandi entailed establishing a reverse shell to

                    The website in question is freedownloadmanager[.]org, which,
                    according to the Russian cybersecurity firm, offers a
                    legitimate Linux software called "Free Download Manager,"
                    but starting in January 2020, began redirecting some users
                    who attempted to download it to another domain
                    deb.fdmpkg[.]org that served a booby-trapped Debian package.

                    It's suspected that the malware authors engineered the
                    attack based on certain predefined filtering criteria (say,
                    a digital fingerprint of the system) to selectively lead
                    potential victims to the malicious version. The rogue
                    redirects ended in 2022 for inexplicable reasons.

                    [...] It's not immediately clear how the compromise actually
                    took place and what the end goals of the campaign were.
                    What's evident is that not everyone who downloaded the
                    software received the rogue package, enabling it to evade
                    detection for years.

                    during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that any
                    kind of pause on AI development would mean that China could
                    get the better of the U.S. in technological supremacy. He
                    was adamant that the U.S. spend even more of its defense
                    budget by investing even more money on “capabilities that

                    between researchers at the University of Colorado, MIT and
                    the NASA Ames Research Center, researchers studied samples
                    from the space station using a specific and well-understood
                    gram-negative kind of bacteria. The scientists also joined
                    forces with experts at
                    <a href="https://liquiglide.com/">LiquiGlide</a>, a company
                    run by MIT researcher Kripa Varanasi that specializes in
                    “eliminating the friction between solids and liquids.” The
                    multidisciplinary study found covering surfaces with a thin
                    layer of nucleic acids prevented bacterial growth on the
                    ISS-exposed samples.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The scientists concluded that these acids carried a slight
                    negative electric charge that stopped microbes from sticking
                    to surfaces. It's worth noting though, that the bacteria
                    were up against a unique physical barrier as well as a
                    chemical one: testing surfaces were etched into "nanograss."
                    These silicon spikes, which resembled a tiny forest, were
                    then slicked with a silicon oil, creating a slippery surface
                    which biofilms struggled to adhere to.

                    choices simply to maximise their morality score, and others
                    who viewed the meter as some sort of moral guide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A second paper published earlier this year in
                    <em>Computers in Human Behaviour</em> provides the first
                    quantitative data on morality meters. The results show the
                    meter is generally ignored when a moral choice is
                    straightforward, but it can influence decisions when the
                    choice is morally ambiguous.

                    the paper we argue that when the victim is more salient, the
                    association between the guilt trait and corrupt behavior
                    becomes stronger." Concern for others' suffering, they said,
                    might play a significant role in how guilt-proneness
                    influences bribe-taking behaviors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Indeed, the researchers say, guilt proneness is not
                    the only trait that might predict corrupt behaviors (or lack
                    of them), and it's worth studying how this trait, along with
                    other personality traits, might "serve as a reliable
                    anti-corruption predictor in personnel selection," such as
                    when choosing people for leadership positions or for
                    high-stakes jobs.

                    "We can't claim causality, but we can leverage the
                    association between the guilt trait and the lower likelihood
                    of corruption to make us more confident about their
                    integrity," Yu said. "Maybe that's something we can apply to

                    The water coming out of your faucet is safe to drink, but
                    that doesn't mean it's completely clean. Chlorine has long
                    been the standard for water treatment, but it often contains
                    trace levels of disinfection byproducts and unknown
                    contaminants. Georgia Institute of Technology researchers
                    developed the minus approach to handle these harmful
                    byproducts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead of relying on traditional chemical addition (known
                    as the plus approach), the minus approach avoids
                    disinfectants, chemical coagulants, and advanced oxidation
                    processes typical to water treatment processes. It uses a
                    unique mix of filtration methods to remove byproducts and
                    pathogens, enabling water treatment centers to use
                    ultraviolet light and much smaller doses of chemical
                    disinfectants to minimize future bacterial growth down the
                    distribution system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The minus approach is a groundbreaking philosophical
                    concept in water treatment," said Yongsheng Chen, the Bonnie
                    W. and Charles W. Moorman IV Professor in the School of
                    Civil and Environmental Engineering. "Its primary objective
                    is to achieve these outcomes while minimizing the reliance
                    on chemical treatments, which can give rise to various
                    issues in the main water treatment stream."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chen and his student Elliot Reid, the primary author,
                    presented
                    <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c09389"

                    >
                    in the paper, "The Minus Approach Can Redefine the Standard
                    of Practice of Drinking Water Treatment," in the
                    <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i> journal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The minus approach physically separates emerging
                    contaminants and disinfection byproducts from the main water
                    treatment process using these already proven processes:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The minus approach is intended to engage the water community
                    in designing safer, more sustainable, and more intelligent
                    systems. Because its technologies are already available and
                    proven, the minus approach can be implemented immediately.

                    The main feature of the new specification is its ability to

                    simultaneously receiving data at up to 40 Gbps. The mode,

                    Turchin, however, now holds a different view. Increasing
                    evidence suggested that "simple" Neolithic farmers'
                    societies also collapsed. "In fact, such cases are much more
                    profound than the social and political breakdown of more
                    recent societies, because archaeology indicates that
                    substantial regions were depopulated."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Since we don't see consistent large-scale political
                    organization during this time, it would be easy to imagine
                    that things were static, such that people settled in a
                    village and lived there for three or four thousand years
                    without much happening in between. That doesn't seem to be
                    the case. Sadly, this also means that this period was more
                    violent than previously thought."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Additionally, the study indicates that humans and
                    their interactions, whether friendly or violent, form a
                    complex system, regardless of their political or economic
                    organization. It doesn't matter if you don't want to
                    organize into a state, you are still affected by your
                    neighbors and their neighbors as well," adds Kondor.

                    has reported that even though the components for Apple's
                    chips will be manufactured in the US, they'll still have to
                    be sent back to TSMC's home country for assembly.

                  <p>
                    Apparently, the manufacturer's factory in Arizona doesn't
                    have the facilities to package its customers' more advanced
                    chips. "Packaging" is what you call the final stage of
                    fabrication, wherein the chip's components are assembled
                    inside a housing as close together as possible to enhance
                    speed and power efficiency. The iPhone, in particular, has
                    been using a packaging method developed by TSMC since 2016.
                    Chips for iPads and Macs can be packaged outside of Taiwan,
                    but the iPhone's will have to be assembled in the country.

                    (PDF) a National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing program to
                    boost chip packaging in the US, it's aware of the need to
                    bring the process into the country, as well. Apple and all
                    the aforementioned TSMC clients aren't the only companies
                    whose chips have to be sent overseas for assembly, since
                    manufacturers aren't making enough products in the US to
                    justify building packaging facilities in the country.
                    However, that program is only getting $2.5 billion in
                    funding under the CHIPS Act, and the Institute of Printed
                    Circuits told the publication that the amount shows
                    packaging isn't being prioritized. As for TSMC,
                    <em>The Information's</em> sources said it has no plans to
                    build packaging facilities in the US due to the huge costs
                    involved, and any future packaging method it develops will
                    most likely be offered in Taiwan.

                    [...] But CTE is preventable. Small changes to practice
                    drills and gameplay could make a huge difference for young
                    athletes, says Nowinski. The playbook for prevention is
                    simple: Reduce the number of hits to the head, and reduce
                    the strength of those hits. Most happen during practice, so
                    by reducing the number of drills involving head impacts and
                    choosing ones that are less likely to cause high-magnitude
                    blows, coaches can spare their players unnecessary danger.
                    "You can't get rid of CTE in tackling sports," adds
                    Nowinski, "but you can get rid of most cases of CTE."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Reducing the length of each game and the number of games per
                    season can minimize the likelihood of head injuries, and
                    banning brain-jostling events, like fighting in hockey or
                    heading in soccer, can make games safer, he continues.
                    Perhaps most importantly, youth sports leagues can raise the
                    age at which kids are first exposed to preventable head
                    impacts. "With tackle football before 14, the risks are not
                    worth the benefits," Nowinski says. "You don't become a
                    better football player from playing young." In one case
                    study reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and
                    Prevention, transitioning from tackle to flag football would
                    reduce a young athlete's median number of head impacts per
                    season from 378 to eight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, Nowinski points out, there is no central governing body
                    in charge of youth sports leagues, leaving it largely up to
                    individual coaches to make changes to their practice drills
                    and recruitment strategies. "The opportunity is right in
                    front of our faces," says Nowinski. "I remember being told
                    how much football makes you a leader. But right now, on this
                    issue, there's a black hole of leadership."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    McKee doesn't think that parents should take their kids out
                    of sports—far from it. "We just need to change the rules and
                    our thinking about these games, so that CTE isn't a
                    consequence of playing contact sports," McKee says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And for young athletes concerned about CTE, she urges them
                    to seek help for mental health symptoms, build personal
                    support systems, and keep moving forward with their lives.
                    "Individuals like Evan need to be seen, because in all
                    likelihood, we can treat their symptoms and help them feel
                    less hopeless," she says. "It's not a time to despair. It's
                    a time to come in, be evaluated, and be treated."

                    Venus' atmosphere may be due to meteors passing through, not
                    lightning strikes. In their paper published in
                    <i>Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets,</i> the group
                    describes their study of the flashes of light and what they
                    learned about them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists studying Venus have noted periodic flashes of
                    light in its atmosphere for many years. For most of that
                    time the flashes have been attributed to lightning flashing
                    through the planet's atmosphere. Probes sent to the planet
                    have done little to confirm the origin of the flashes—bursts
                    of electromagnetic static have been recorded, which have
                    been likened to the type heard during thunderstorms on
                    Earth, suggesting lightning as a likely source.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But there has also been a sticking point—recorded bursts of
                    static and images of a light flashing through the atmosphere
                    have never been observed happening at the same time. Also,
                    there is little evidence showing that Venus' atmosphere is
                    capable of producing lightning. Such issues led the
                    researchers on this new effort to consider another
                    source—meteors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In comparing the number of flashes recorded in Venus'
                    atmosphere with the number of possible meteor strikes, the
                    team found them to be close enough to suggest that they
                    could be related. More research is required, but if the
                    initial findings turn out to be correct, space agencies will
                    breathe a sigh of relief—sending a probe through clouds
                    laden with lightning strikes is far more difficult than one
                    where the skies are occasionally lit up by meteors.

                    cruising across highways is one of those tempting technocrat
                    ideas that doesn't look like it will pan out. As autonomous
                    driving technology matured in the middle of the last decade,
                    we saw trials of the concept, but human truck drivers do
                    more than just throttle, steer, and brake, and they aren't
                    likely to be replaced soon.

                  <p>
                    A better idea would be to shift some of that cargo to our
                    underutilized railways—here, the idea of platooning is an
                    old one, better known as a "train." Parallel Systems hopes
                    to do just that with its second-generation autonomous
                    battery-electric freight railcar.

                    For state-sponsored hacking operations, unpatched
                    vulnerabilities are valuable ammunition. Intelligence
                    agencies and militaries seize on hackable bugs when they're
                    revealed—exploiting them to carry out their campaigns of
                    espionage or cyberwar—or spend millions to dig up new ones
                    or to buy them in secret from the hacker gray market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But for the past two years, China has added another approach
                    to obtaining information about those vulnerabilities: a law
                    that simply demands that any network technology business
                    operating in the country hand it over. When tech companies
                    learn of a hackable flaw in their products, they're now
                    required to tell a Chinese government agency—which, in some
                    cases, then shares that information with China's
                    state-sponsored hackers, according to a new investigation.
                    And some evidence suggests foreign firms with China-based
                    operations are complying with the law, indirectly giving
                    Chinese authorities hints about potential new ways to hack
                    their own customers.

                    vulnerabilities in tech products.<br />[...]<br />The
                    report's authors combed through the Chinese government's own
                    descriptions of that program to chart the complex path the
                    vulnerability information then takes: The data is shared
                    with several other government bodies, including China's
                    National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical
                    Teams/Coordination Center, or CNCERT/CC, an agency devoted
                    to defending Chinese networks. But the researchers found
                    that CNCERT/CC makes its reports available to technology
                    "partners" that include exactly the sort of Chinese

                    Caldera, the discovery of the deposit will be a massive
                    boost to the United States' lithium reserves, which have
                    been estimated at just one million metric tons. Most of the
                    world's major deposits are in countries outside of North
                    America, such as Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, China and
                    Australia. It could also encourage more US investment in
                    electric cars and will alleviate fears over lithium
                    shortages – it's thought that a million metric tons of
                    lithium will be needed by 2024.

                  <p>
                    The size of the deposit still has to be confirmed, but

                    the supply in 2026.

                    the Native American tribes who say the land is sacred. There
                    are also potential dangers to native wildlife, and
                    researchers are worried that the project will cause
                    groundwater levels to drop to dangerous levels. Even NASA
                    has spoken out against mining in the area. The space agency
                    has been using Nevada's Railroad Valley lakebed since 1993
                    to accurately gauge the time it takes for satellite signals
                    to travel to Earth and back, allowing it to calibrate the
                    satellites.

                    A new investigation with NASA's James Webb Space Telescope
                    into K2-18 b, an exoplanet 8.6 times as massive as Earth,
                    has revealed the presence of carbon-bearing molecules
                    including methane and carbon dioxide. Webb's discovery adds
                    to recent studies suggesting that K2-18 b could be a Hycean
                    exoplanet, one which has the potential to possess a
                    hydrogen-rich atmosphere and a water ocean-covered surface.

                  <p>
                    The first insight into the atmospheric properties of this
                    habitable-zone exoplanet came from

                    and lies 120 light-years from Earth in the constellation
                    Leo. Exoplanets such as K2-18 b, which have sizes between
                    those of Earth and Neptune, are unlike anything in our solar
                    system. This lack of equivalent nearby planets means that
                    these 'sub-Neptunes' are poorly understood, and the nature
                    of their atmospheres is a matter of active debate among
                    astronomers.<br />[...]<br />The abundance of methane and
                    carbon dioxide, and shortage of ammonia, support the
                    hypothesis that there may be a water ocean underneath a
                    hydrogen-rich atmosphere in K2-18 b. These initial Webb
                    observations also provided a possible detection of a
                    molecule called dimethyl sulfide (DMS). On Earth, this is
                    only produced by life. The bulk of the DMS in Earth's
                    atmosphere is emitted from phytoplankton in marine
                    environments.

                  <p>
                    The inference of DMS is less robust and requires further
                    validation. "Upcoming Webb observations should be able to
                    confirm if DMS is indeed present in the atmosphere of K2-18
                    b at significant levels," explained Madhusudhan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While K2-18 b lies in the habitable zone, and is now known
                    to harbor carbon-bearing molecules, this does not
                    necessarily mean that the planet can support life. The
                    planet's large size — with a radius 2.6 times the radius of
                    Earth — means that the planet's interior likely contains a
                    large mantle of high-pressure ice, like Neptune, but with a
                    thinner hydrogen-rich atmosphere and an ocean surface.
                    Hycean worlds are predicted to have oceans of water.
                    However, it is also possible that the ocean is too hot to be
                    habitable or be liquid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Although this kind of planet does not exist in our solar
                    system, sub-Neptunes are the most common type of planet
                    known so far in the galaxy," explained team member Subhajit
                    Sarkar of Cardiff University. "We have obtained the most
                    detailed spectrum of a habitable-zone sub-Neptune to date,
                    and this allowed us to work out the molecules that exist in
                    its atmosphere."

                  <p>
                    Characterizing the atmospheres of exoplanets like K2-18 b —
                    meaning identifying their gases and physical conditions — is
                    a very active area in astronomy. However, these planets are
                    outshone — literally — by the glare of their much larger
                    parent stars, which makes exploring exoplanet atmospheres
                    particularly challenging.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team sidestepped this challenge by analyzing light from
                    K2-18 b's parent star as it passed through the exoplanet's
                    atmosphere. K2-18 b is a transiting exoplanet, meaning that
                    we can detect a drop in brightness as it passes across the
                    face of its host star. This is how the exoplanet was first
                    discovered in 2015 with NASA's K2 mission. This means that
                    during transits a tiny fraction of starlight will pass
                    through the exoplanet's atmosphere before reaching
                    telescopes like Webb. The starlight's passage through the
                    exoplanet atmosphere leaves traces that astronomers can
                    piece together to determine the gases of the exoplanet's
                    atmosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This result was only possible because of the extended
                    wavelength range and unprecedented sensitivity of Webb,
                    which enabled robust detection of spectral features with
                    just two transits," said Madhusudhan. "For comparison, one
                    transit observation with Webb provided comparable precision
                    to eight observations with Hubble conducted over a few years
                    and in a relatively narrow wavelength range."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These results are the product of just two observations of
                    K2-18 b, with many more on the way," explained team member
                    Savvas Constantinou of the University of Cambridge. "This
                    means our work here is but an early demonstration of what
                    Webb can observe in habitable-zone exoplanets."

                    The very first web browser was the WorldWideWeb of
                    Berners-Lee, but the first popularized web browser was the
                    NCSA Mosaic Internet Web Browser. Previous web browsers were
                    not user friendly; they lacked an intuitive and inviting way
                    to allow people to navigate the then-new World Wide Web.In
                    1992 two developers at the National Center for
                    Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of
                    Illinois (Marc Andreessen and Eric Brina) began working on a
                    graphical, user friendly web browser they would later call
                    "Mosaic". The most notable features this computer program
                    had that other browsers lacked were the ability to view
                    pictures directly on the page, its ease of navigation, and
                    the way this browser handled hyperlinks. Previous browsers
                    only showed pictures as separate files available for
                    download that were linked to the page, so no pictures were
                    directly visible from any main web page. Other browsers also
                    lacked a smooth graphical interface to help navigate through
                    the page, to include scrolling and the now-standard "back",
                    "forward", and "refresh" buttons. Finally, the Mosaic
                    browser was the first browser to incorporate clickable
                    hyperlinks. Previous browsers gave reference numbers so
                    users could manually type in the new URL, whereas this new
                    browser allowed users to simply click the link directly to
                    get to the desired page.

                    "To be sure, Mosaic deserves credit for tackling two
                    problems. First, earlier browsers were troublesome to get up
                    and running, while Mosaic was a lot easier, thanks largely
                    to [NCSA developer Eric] Bina's programming skill. Second,
                    Mosaic was the first published browser that automatically
                    displayed pictures along with text, as in the pages of a
                    magazine layout or an illustrated book. That was important
                    because later on it would be the proliferation of pretty
                    pictures that transformed that Web from the domain of
                    scientists and hackers to a cultural phenomenon that
                    captured the interest of the masses."

                    a deal with Heirloom Carbon, a startup that has developed a
                    process for using limestone to capture carbon to fight
                    climate change. The technique could contribute to
                    Microsoft's ongoing attempt to become carbon-negative.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Limestone naturally absorbs carbon over many years, but
                    Heirloom's method accelerates the process. The company uses
                    a kiln powered by renewable energy to heat crushed limestone
                    to around 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit, which separates it into
                    carbon dioxide and calcium oxide. Adding water to the
                    calcium oxide allows it to absorb sufficient amounts of
                    carbon within days, after which Heirloom re-inserts it into
                    the kiln to restart the cycle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although the technology is proven, the maximum scale at
                    which it remains cost-effective is unclear. Another issue
                    facing all carbon capture methods is storing the substance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Regardless of the limestone method's effectiveness, it
                    will likely need to complement other carbon capture
                    technologies that Microsoft is

                    company also said that by 2050, it wants to remove all of
                    the carbon it has ever emitted since its 1975 founding.

                    time spent watching videos from alternative and extremist
                    channels," says Nyhan. "We interpret that relationship as
                    suggesting that people are seeking this content out."

                    By contrast, the researchers found that recommendations to
                    alternative and extremist channel videos were very rare and
                    that "rabbit hole"-type events were only observed a handful
                    of times during the study period.

                    Since its release in 1993, id Software's DOOM franchise has
                    become one of modern gaming's most easily recognizable IPs.
                    The series has sold more than 10 million copies to date and
                    spawned myriad RPG spinoffs, film adaptations and even a
                    couple tabletop board games. But the first game's debut
                    turned out to be a close thing, id Software cofounder John
                    Romero describes in an excerpt from his new book DOOM GUY:
                    Life in First Person. With a mere month before DOOM was
                    scheduled for release in December 1993, the iD team found
                    itself still polishing and tweaking lead programmer John
                    Carmack's novel peer-to-peer multiplayer architecture,
                    ironing out level designs — at a time when the studio's
                    programmers were also its QA team — and introducing
                    everybody's favorite killer synonym to the gamer lexicon.

                    the state of California over a law that requires companies
                    to disclose details about their content moderation
                    practices. The law, known as AB 587, requires social media
                    companies to publish information about their handling of
                    hate speech, extremism, misinformation and other issues, as

                  <p>
                    Lawyers for X argue that the law is unconstitutional and
                    will lead to censorship. It “has both the purpose and likely
                    effect of pressuring companies such as X Corp. to remove,
                    demonetize, or deprioritize constitutionally-protected
                    speech,” the company wrote in the

                      >lawsuit</a
                    >. “The true intent of AB 587 is to pressure social media
                    platforms to ‘eliminate’ certain constitutionally-protected
                    content viewed by the State as problematic.”

                  <p>
                    [...] At the same time, AB 587's backers have said it’s
                    necessary to increase the transparency of major platforms.
                    “If @X has nothing to hide, then they should have no

                    users’ timelines without being labeled as such,

                    mistakenly believe the platform is showing posts from
                    accounts they don’t follow in their following timeline, the
                    issue also risks stirring up more regulatory trouble with

                    It’s unclear if the unlabeled ads are the result of a bug or
                    an intentional change by the company. X, which no longer has
                    a functioning communications department, didn’t respond to a

                    The team found that thermal moonquakes occur with the
                    regularity of clockwork, every morning and afternoon. The
                    latter are the result of the Sun leaving its peak position
                    in the sky, allowing the lunar surface to begin to cool off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the team's artificial intelligence model revealed
                    that the seismic activity detected in the morning has a
                    different profile — and are not regular thermal moonquakes
                    at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using the data from the seismometer array to triangulate the
                    source of the morning quakes, Husker and his team found that
                    they were coming from the left-behind descent stage of the
                    Apollo 17 lunar module.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Seismological studies of the Moon are — as on Earth —
                    also a great way to get a glimpse of the structure beneath
                    the surface. This is because seismic waves travel at
                    different speeds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As Husker adds, using moonquakes, "we will hopefully be able
                    to map out the subsurface cratering and to look for
                    deposits."
                  </p>

              <p>Spotify used to launder drug money?</p>
              <p>
                On a series of articles gang members, criminals and
                investigators from the police tell how Spotify is used to
                launder drug money.
              </p>
              <blockquote>

                    "I can say with 100 percent certainty that this goes on. I
                    have been involved in it myself," SvD quoted one anonymous
                    gang member as saying.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said his gang began using the music streaming giant
                    Spotify for money laundering in 2019, around the time
                    Swedish gangster rap became popular in the country and
                    started winning music awards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We have paid people who have done this for us
                    systematically," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Describing the process, he said the gangs would convert
                    their dirty cash to bitcoin, then used the cryptocurrency to
                    pay people who sold fake streams on Spotify, which is a
                    Swedish company.

                Spotify is feigning ignorance. They somehow missed that this has
                been going on for at least four years.
              </p>

                Do other entertainment services have the same problems in the
                modern digital world?

                    Researchers at Iowa State University found a simple
                    intervention could help. During a two-week experiment with
                    230 college students, half were asked to limit their social
                    media usage to 30 minutes a day and received automated,
                    daily reminders. They scored significantly lower for
                    anxiety, depression, loneliness and fear of missing out at
                    the end of the experiment compared to the control group.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They also scored higher for "positive affect," which the
                    researchers describe as "the tendency to experience positive
                    emotions described with words such as 'excited' and
                    'proud.'" Essentially, they had a brighter outlook on life.

                    "It surprised me to find that participants' well-being did
                    not only improve in one dimension but in all of them. I was
                    excited to learn that such a simple intervention of sending
                    a daily reminder can motivate people to change their
                    behavior and improve their social media habits." says

                    [...] Many of the participants in the ISU study commented
                    that the first few days of cutting back were challenging.
                    But after the initial push, one student felt more productive
                    and in tune with life. Others shared that they were getting
                    better sleep or spending more time with people in person.

                    <strong>at 10:42 a.m. ET Sept. 24. </strong>But four hours
                    before the package pierces Earth's atmosphere, flight
                    controllers will make a decision about whether to proceed
                    with the separation of the capsule from its spacecraft,
                    based on human safety, capsule survivability, and landing

                    After the spacecraft releases the capsule about 63,000 miles
                    from Earth, it will travel through space for about 20
                    minutes before firing its thrusters to avoid Earth. At that

                        encouraging users to do things in a particular way and
                        discouraging them from other things, such as putting
                        more than seven bullet points on a slide, he

                        maybe you should think about talking about something

                    They found that a linear statistical model identified hit
                    songs at a success rate of 69%. When they applied machine
                    learning to the data they collected, the rate of correctly
                    identified hit songs jumped to 97%. They also applied
                    machine learning to the neural responses to the first minute
                    of the songs. In this case, hits were correctly identified

                    Furthermore, the demographics of the study participants were
                    moderately diverse, but did not include members of certain

                  <p>Insufficient packaging capacity is to blame.</p>
                  <p>
                    The chairman of TSMC admitted that the ongoing short supply
                    of compute GPUs for artificial intelligence (AI) and
                    high-performance computing (HPC) applications is caused
                    by constraints of its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS)
                    packaging capacity. This shortage is expected to persist for
                    around 18 months due to rising demand for generative AI
                    applicationsand relatively slow expansion of CoWoS capacity
                    at TSMC.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It is not the shortage of AI chips, it is the shortage of
                    our CoWoS capacity," said Mark Liu, the chairman of TSMC,
                    <a
                      href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-sees-AI-chip-output-constraints-lasting-1.5-years"
                      >in a conversation with Nikkei</a
                    > at Semicon Taiwan. "Currently, we cannot fulfill 100% of
                    our customers' needs, but we try to support about 80%. We
                    think this is a temporary phenomenon. After our expansion of
                    [advanced chip packaging capacity], it should be alleviated
                    in one and a half years."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    TSMC is the producer of the majority of AI processors,
                    including Nvidia's A100 and H100 compute GPUs that are
                    integral to AI tools like ChatGPT and are predominantly used
                    in AI data centers. These processors, just like solutions
                    from other players like AMD, AWS, and Google, use HBM memory
                    (which is essential for high
                    bandwidth and proper functioning of extensive AI language
                    models) and CoWoS packaging, which puts additional strain on
                    TSMC's advanced packaging facilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Liu said that demand for CoWoS surged unexpectedly earlier
                    this year, tripling year-over-year, leading to the current
                    supply constraints. TSMC recognizes that demand
                    for generative AI services is growing and so is demand for
                    appropriate hardware, so it is speeding up expansion of
                    CoWoS capacity to meet demand for compute GPUs as well as
                    specialized AI accelerators and processors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At present, the company is installing additional tools for
                    CoWoS at its existing advanced packaging facilities, but
                    this takes time and the company expects its CoWoS capacity
                    to double only by the end of 2024.

                    Until TSMC can bring additional capacity online, Nvidia's

                    models, such as GPT-4 – are at the heart of this shortage.

                    We've reached out to AMD for comment on whether the shortage
                    of CoWoS packaging capacity could impact availability of the
                    chip and we'll let you know if we hear anything back.

                    It's worth noting that TSMC's CoWoS isn't the only packaging

                    for 3D packaging.

                    tech, which can work with chips from different fabs or
                    process nodes. It's called embedded multi-die interconnect
                    bridge (EMIB) for 2.5D packaging and Foveros for vertically
                    stacking chiplets on top of one another.
