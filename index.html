                  <p>
                    A team of aroma chemists at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität
                    Erlangen-Nürnberg, working with psychologist colleagues from
                    the Technical University of Dresden, has uncovered the
                    reasons for the dissimilar smells between babies and
                    teenagers. The
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-024-01131-4"
                      >study</a
                    >
                    is published in the journal
                    <em>Communications Chemistry</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prior research and anecdotal evidence have shown that babies
                    have a pleasant smell, often described as sweet. Teenagers,
                    on the other hand, especially males, have often been
                    described as smelling less pleasant. In this new effort, the
                    research team sought to find out what causes the difference.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers found that most of the chemicals
                    responsible for body odor were similar between the two
                    groups of volunteers. But there were a few that made the
                    difference. Teenage sweat, for example, had high levels of
                    many kinds of carboxylic acids, which the assessors
                    described as "earthy, musty or cheesy."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They also found two steroids in the teen sweat not present
                    in the baby sweat, one of which resulted in "musk or
                    urine-like" emanations—the other, the assessors suggested,
                    smelled more like "musk and sandalwood." Without such
                    chemicals, the sweat of babies smelled much sweeter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers suggest that study of the chemical compounds
                    in teen sweat could prove fruitful for makers of
                    odor-control products. They also suggest that more work
                    could <i>[be]</i> done to better understand the impact of
                    such odors on parents.

              <p><b>Outages</b></p>
              <p>
                I would like to thank you all for your patience during the
                recent outages. Something is causing a problem with the database
                itself. It appears to be running out of room and thus having
                problems when creating backups. This is not a new phenomenon -
                NCommander observed that the database was corrupted in Nov/Dec
                2022, and he fixed the corruptions that were present at that
                time. I know that others have done similar 'repairs' over the
                years. Those of you who have been with us a while will know that
                we have had various site outages since the site's inception in
                2014. We try to get the site up as quickly as possible but we
                currently have a single active sys-admin who has to find the
                time to fix the site in between running his own business and
                having a decent work/life balance. The cause of these
                corruptions has not been identified despite speculation by some
                individuals.
              </p>
              <p><b>New Site</b></p>
              <p>
                The administration associated with creating a business continues
                and we think that we are now at the final stage. The paperwork
                has to be signed by several people and this means sending mail
                around the USA in order to get real signatures from specific
                individuals. However, we think that this should only take a week
                or two.
              </p>
              <p><b>Deleting Spam</b></p>
              <p>
                For the last month or so we have been deleting Spam from the
                Polls and journals. Deleting content is not new. Spam, doxxing,
                abusive material, CEOS, inappropriate ASCII art etc has often
                been deleted in the last 10 years. In fact, most of our
                registered community have the ability to delete some material
                (their own journals for example), and this has happened from
                time to time in the past. We also delete outdated submissions on
                a daily basis. The site software provides a means of making such
                deletions and it can cope with them. The software that is being
                used is not new - it has been in Rehash since the site became
                active. We have received some positive feedback regarding this
                measure - the Polls and journals are looking much tidier as a
                result. Unfortunately, we are going to temporarily suspend this
                measure to simplify the investigations into the database
                corruption problems. So, as unsightly as they are, we will be
                returning to the use of Spam moderations on a hopefully
                temporary basis. We have, of course, also received some negative
                feedback but it only seems to have come from a couple of
                Anonymous Cowards, one of whom is our most prolific spammer.
              </p>
              <p><b>Participation</b></p>
              <p>
                Finally, I would like to thank the staff for their continued
                efforts in keeping the site online and active. The participating
                user count continues to climb, as does the number of pages
                served each day. Many usernames that have existed for a long
                time but appear to have been inactive for a while are
                reappearing and participating in the discussions. I hope that we
                will soon be able to restructure our site in an affordable yet
                more robust structure in the very near future.

                    decades ago in a suburban Minnesota bedroom, loved by so
                    many music fans—and hated by so many others? Pitchfork
                    transformed indie rock, but did pop transform Pitchfork? And
                    does the Condé news really mean that Pitchfork is dead?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the past two months, Slate spoke to more than 30
                    Pitchfork writers, editors, and executives, past and
                    present—as well as critics, industry luminaries, and some of
                    the musicians whose careers Pitchfork made and destroyed—to
                    tell the story behind the raves, the pans, the festivals,
                    the fights, the indie spirit, the corporate takeover, and,
                    of course, the scores. This is the complete oral history of
                    <a href="https://pitchfork.com/">Pitchfork</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The gutting of Pitchfork is not just a loss for
                    writers and editors, but all music fans. Spotify's algorithm
                    can introduce you to new music but it can't contextualise it
                    or tell its stories. Replacing media "gatekeepers" with AI
                    ones has not enriched the culture. There are new formats for
                    music journalism – the YouTuber Anthony Fantano is perhaps
                    the world's most influential music critic, while Cole
                    Cuchna's podcast Dissect is a masterclass in analysis – but
                    like any art form, popular music deserves a thriving
                    critical culture in the written word. While some music
                    websites survive, notably the defiantly left-field digital
                    magazine, the Quietus, it is striking that the alleged
                    dinosaurs of print, led in the UK by Mojo and Uncut, have
                    outlasted most of their supposed successors.

                    While it doesn't have the same relevance to public
                    consciousness as safety problems with commercial airliners,
                    a successful test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in
                    May would be welcome news for the beleaguered aerospace
                    company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This will be the first time the Starliner capsule flies into
                    low-Earth orbit with humans aboard. NASA astronauts Butch
                    Wilmore and Suni Williams are in the final stages of
                    training for the so-called Crew Flight Test (CFT), a
                    milestone running seven years behind the schedule Boeing
                    said it could achieve when it won a $4.2 billion commercial
                    crew contract from NASA a decade ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If schedules hold, Wilmore and Williams will take off inside
                    Boeing's Starliner spacecraft aboard a United Launch
                    Alliance Atlas V rocket after midnight May 1, local time,
                    from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. They
                    will fly Starliner to the International Space Station for a
                    stay of at least eight days, then return the capsule to a
                    parachute-assisted, airbag-cushioned landing in the western
                    United States, likely at White Sands, New Mexico.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first human spaceflight with Starliner will launch under
                    a lame-duck Boeing CEO. Dave Calhoun, who took the helm at
                    Boeing in 2020, announced Monday he will step down at the
                    end of the year. Boeing's chairman, Larry Kellner, will not
                    seek reelection at the company's next shareholder meeting.
                    Effective immediately, Boeing is also replacing the head of
                    its commercial airplanes unit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The last few years have not been good for Boeing. A spate of
                    safety shortcomings in the company's commercial airline
                    business has shattered the company's reputation. Two crashes
                    of Boeing's 737 Max 8 airplanes in 2018 and 2019 killed 346
                    people, and investigators blamed Boeing's design and
                    software for the accidents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In a report released by the Federal Aviation
                    Administration last month, a panel of experts found that
                    Boeing's safety culture was "inadequate and confusing." The
                    panel also noted a "lack of pilot input in aircraft design
                    and operation."

                    American workers who have more flexibility and security in
                    their jobs also have better mental health, according to
                    <a
                      href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2816735"

                    >
                    from over 18,000 nationally representative working
                    Americans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open, may not be
                    surprising to those who have faced return-to-office mandates
                    and rounds of layoffs amid the pandemic. But, it offers
                    clear data on just how important job flexibility and
                    security are to the health and well-being of workers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Overall, the study's findings indicate "the
                    substantive impact that flexible and secure jobs can have on
                    mental health in the short-term and long-term," the
                    researchers conclude.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They do note limitations of the study, the main one being
                    that the study identifies associations and can't determine
                    that job flexibility and security directly caused mental
                    health outcomes and the work absence findings. Still, they
                    suggest that workplace policies could improve the mental
                    health of employees.

                    Last week I fell into a bit of a rabbit hole: why do regular
                    expressions use $ and ^ as line anchors?1
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This talk brings up that they first appeared in Ken
                    Thompson's port of the QED text editor. In his manual he
                    writes: b) "^" is a regular expression which matches
                    character at the beginning of a line.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    c) "$" is a regular expression which matches character
                    before the character (usually at the end of a line)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    QED was the precursor to ed, which was instrumental in
                    popularizing regexes, so a lot of its design choices stuck.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Okay, but then why did Ken Thompson choose those characters?

                Dr Andy Farnell at
                <a href="https://cybershow.uk/">The Cyber Show</a> writes about
                motivations behind dropping use of generative AI for graphics
                and moving back to manual design and editing of images. The show
                had been using generative AI to produce images since its first
                episode, but now find that it is time to rethink that policy. As
                the guard rails for generative AI are set up and the boundaries
                restricted, it gets more racist, more gendered, and less able to
                output edgy ideas critical of its corporate owners and its
                potential as an equalizing force seems dead already. So, while
                the show could set up its own AI instance to generate the images
                they desire, there is the matter of association and the decision
                to stop using it has been made.

                    Doubts emerged late last year after Helen battled with many
                    of the generative platforms to get less racist and gendered
                    cultural assumptions. We even had some ideas for an episode
                    about baked bias, but other podcasters picked up on that and
                    did a fine job of investigating and explicating.

                    Though, maybe more is still to be said. With time I've
                    noticed the "guardrails" are staring to close in like a pack
                    of dogs. The tools seem ever less willing to output edgy
                    ideas critical of corporate gangsters. That feels like a
                    direct impingement on visual art culture. Much like

                    there seems to be an built-in aversion to humour, and for
                    that matter to hope, love or faith in the future of humaity.
                    The "five giant websites filled with screenshots of text
                    from the other four" are devoid of anything human.

                    Like the companies that make them, commercial AI tools seem
                    to have blind-spots around irony, juxtaposition and
                    irreverence. They have no chutzpah. Perhaps we are just
                    bumping into the limits of machine creativity in its current
                    iteration. Or maybe there's a "directing mind", biasing
                    output toward tepid, mediocre "acceptability". That's not
                    us!

                    Boeing Co CEO Dave Calhoun will step down by year-end, in a
                    broad management shakeup brought on by the plane maker's
                    sprawling safety crisis stemming from a January mid-air
                    panel blowout on a 737 Max plane.

                  <p>
                    The plane maker also said that Stan Deal, Boeing Commercial
                    Airplanes President and CEO, would retire, and Stephanie
                    Pope would lead that business. Steve Mollenkopf has been

                    The leadership change caps weeks of turmoil at Boeing, after
                    the mid-air incident involving an Alaska Airlines-operated
                    Max 9 jet carrying 171 passengers turned into a full-blown
                    safety and reputational crisis for the iconic plane maker.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company is facing heavy regulatory scrutiny and U.S.
                    authorities curbed production while it attempts to fix
                    safety and quality issues. The company is in talks to buy
                    its former subsidiary Spirit AeroSystems to try to get more
                    control over its supply chain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since Calhoun took the reins, the company has endured
                    ongoing delays to production. Still, in October, Calhoun was
                    upbeat over how fast Boeing could raise output of its Max
                    jets, saying Boeing would get back to 38 jets a month and
                    was "anxious to build from there as fast as we can."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But weeks after the mid-air cabin panel blowout in January,
                    Calhoun said it's time to "go slow to go fast."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company's crisis has frustrated airlines already
                    struggling with delivery delays from both Boeing and its
                    rival Airbus, and the plane maker has been burning more cash
                    than expected in this quarter than expected.

                  <p>
                    "For years, we prioritized the movement of the airplane
                    through the factory over getting it done right, and that's
                    got to change," West said last week.

                    Borealis, shining like a jewel in the Northern Crown. It's a
                    U-shaped constellation behind Hercules' back and under
                    Boötes the Herdman's elbow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While not as spectacularly dramatic as a supernova,
                    Gilbraith hopes Wyomingites will be curious enough to seek
                    out Corona Borealis and observe the impending nova. Once its
                    light gets here, it should be visible for several weeks, at
                    least.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The nova might not be the brightest or most exciting
                    sight in the night sky, but it's quite important for
                    science. Gilbraith said novae help astronomers measure
                    precise distances in space, revealing our distance from
                    other galaxies with much greater accuracy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But T Coroane Borealis is special. It's one of only five
                    recurring novae in the night sky, which means it has
                    repeatedly sent flashes of light, usually once every 80
                    years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "A nova is a standard candle that always occurs at a
                    characteristic mass," he said. "It's holding onto some mass
                    thrown it from its neighbor, and it will briefly reignite
                    that candle just a little."

                    Google will spend $1 billion to build a new data center in

                    attended by both Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas and
                    Missouri governor Mike Parson. The new plant is expected to
                    provide significant benefits for Missouri's Northland
                    economy, while Picou highlighted how Kansas City and Google
                    can work together to bring a brighter future to the region.

                    Data centers are the backbone of Google's investment
                    strategy, Picou said, especially now that the industry is
                    reaching an important "inflection point" for tech innovation
                    thanks to AI algorithms. Governor Parson

                    Mayor Lucas said that one in every ten workers in Kansas
                    City is involved in the technology industry, and thanks to
                    Google, the city will keep growing its appeal for tech
                    companies. The firm is planning to fund the North Kansas
                    City School District's STEAM center with a $100,000 grant,
                    and to bring its Skilled Trades and Readiness program to the

                  <p>
                    In December 2014, North Korea's cyber group Kimsuky
                    conducted an attack on the South Korean Korea Hydro and
                    Nuclear Power (KHNP), leaking personal information of 10,000
                    employees, reactor blueprints, manuals, electricity charts,
                    radiation methods and more. Despite the impact of the 2014
                    KHNP hack on South Korea, it has figured minimally in
                    English-language cybersecurity literature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In 2013, North Korea used the DARKSEOUL malware to
                    paralyze ROK broadcasting stations, banks and government
                    sites after its long-term espionage campaign, Operation
                    Troy. In December 2014, however, despite those precautionary
                    steps, KHNP was hacked. Kimsuky used a Twitter account named
                    "president of anti-nuclear reactor group" to post sensitive
                    documents and blueprints from KHNP and threatened to leak
                    more information unless specific reactors in Gori and
                    Wolseong were shut down by Christmas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As with most research regarding cyber operations and
                    the DPRK, the scarcity of publicly available information
                    posed a challenge. This was especially true for the period
                    from 2014 to 2022 when the Moon Jae-in administration in
                    South Korea was reluctant to publicly attribute cyber
                    operations to North Korea for political purposes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The 2014 KHNP hack marked a pivotal turning point for
                    ROK cyber policy. While North Korea's Kimsuky was successful
                    in stealing sensitive information and publicly demonstrating
                    the vulnerabilities of the South Korean nuclear energy
                    industry to cyberattacks.

                    What would have been a bad dream for many was a massive win
                    for the Florida wildlife experts who discovered a

                    significantly disrupted Florida's ecosystem for more than
                    four decades, were discovered on Feb. 21 in a marsh near

                    located using novel implants researchers inserted in male
                    "scout snakes." Once the snakes were set free, those
                    tracking them could follow a signal emitted from the
                    reptiles into remote areas.

                    If there is life in the solar system beyond Earth, it might
                    be found in the clouds of Venus. In contrast to the planet's
                    blisteringly inhospitable surface, Venus' cloud layer, which
                    extends from 30 to 40 miles above the surface, hosts milder
                    temperatures that could support some extreme forms of life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If it's out there, scientists have assumed that any Venusian
                    cloud inhabitant would look very different from life forms
                    on Earth. That's because the clouds themselves are made from
                    highly toxic droplets of sulfuric acid—an intensely
                    corrosive chemical that is known to dissolve metals and
                    destroy most biological molecules on Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But a new study by MIT researchers may challenge that
                    assumption. Published today in the journal
                    <em>Astrobiology</em>, the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2023.0082"
                      >study</a
                    >
                    reports that, in fact, some key building blocks of life can
                    persist in solutions of concentrated sulfuric acid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study's authors have found that 19 amino acids that are
                    essential to life on Earth are stable for up to four weeks
                    when placed in vials of sulfuric acid at concentrations
                    similar to those in Venus' clouds. In particular, they found
                    that the molecular "backbone" of all 19 amino acids remained
                    intact in sulfuric acid solutions ranging in concentration
                    from 81% to 98%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What is absolutely surprising is that concentrated sulfuric
                    acid is not a solvent that is universally hostile to organic
                    chemistry," says study co-author Janusz Petkowski, a
                    research affiliate in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric
                    and Planetary Sciences (EAPS).

                    [...] The search for life in Venus' clouds has gained
                    momentum in recent years, spurred in part by a controversial
                    detection of phosphine—a molecule that is considered to be
                    one signature of life—in the planet's atmosphere. While that
                    detection remains under debate, the news has reinvigorated
                    an old question: Could Earth's sister planet actually host
                    life?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In search of an answer, scientists are planning several
                    missions to Venus, including the first largely privately
                    funded mission to the planet, backed by California-based
                    launch company Rocket Lab. That mission, on which Seager is
                    the science principal investigator, aims to send a
                    spacecraft through the planet's clouds to analyze their
                    chemistry for signs of organic molecules.

                    Have you ever wondered what's inside your Macbook's charger?
                    There's a lot more circuitry crammed into the compact power
                    adapter than you'd expect, including a microprocessor. This
                    charger teardown looks at the numerous components in the
                    charger and explains how they work together to power your
                    laptop.
                  </p>

                    Most consumer electronics, from your cell phone to your
                    television, use a switching power supply to convert AC power
                    from the wall to the low-voltage DC used by electronic
                    circuits. The switching power supply gets its name because
                    it switches power on and off thousands of times a second,
                    which turns out to be a very efficient way to do this
                    conversion.

                    [...] One unexpected component is a tiny circuit board with
                    a microcontroller, which can be seen above. This 16-bit
                    processor constantly monitors the charger's voltage and
                    current. It enables the output when the charger is connected
                    to a Macbook, disables the output when the charger is
                    disconnected, and shuts the charger off if there is a
                    problem. This processor is a Texas Instruments MSP430
                    microcontroller, roughly as powerful as the processor inside
                    the original Macintosh.

                    Doctors in Boston have transplanted a pig kidney into a
                    62-year-old patient, the latest experiment in the quest to
                    use animal organs in humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Massachusetts General Hospital said Thursday that it's the
                    first time a genetically modified pig kidney has been
                    transplanted into a living person. Previously, pig kidneys
                    have been temporarily transplanted into brain-dead donors.
                    Also, two men received heart transplants from pigs, although
                    both died within months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The patient, Richard "Rick" Slayman of Weymouth,
                    Massachusetts, is recovering well from the surgery last
                    Saturday and is expected to be discharged soon, doctors said
                    Thursday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, the transplant surgeon, said the team
                    believes the pig kidney will work for at least two years. If
                    it fails, Slayman could go back on dialysis, said kidney
                    specialist Dr. Winfred Williams. He noted that unlike the
                    pig heart recipients who were very sick, Slayman is
                    "actually quite robust."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Dr. Parsia Vagefi, chief of surgical transplantation
                    at UT Southwestern Medical Center, called the announcement
                    "a big step forward." But echoing the Boston doctors, he
                    said studies involving more patients at different medical
                    centers would be needed for it to become more commonly
                    available.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The experiment marks the latest development in
                    xenotransplantation, the term for efforts to try to heal
                    human patients with cells, tissues, or organs from animals.
                    For decades, it didn't work — the human immune system
                    immediately destroyed foreign animal tissue. More recent
                    attempts have involved pigs that have been modified so their
                    organs are more humanlike — increasing hope that they might
                    one day help fill a shortage of donated organs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Pigs have long been used in human medicine, including
                    pig skin grafts and implantation of pig heart valves. But
                    transplanting entire organs is much more complex than using
                    highly processed tissue. The kidney implanted in Slayman was
                    provided by eGenesis of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The pig
                    was genetically edited to remove harmful pig genes and add
                    certain human genes to improve its compatibility with
                    humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Food and Drug Administration gave special
                    permission for Slayman's transplant under "compassionate
                    use" rules.

                    For over half a century, aperiodic tilings have fascinated
                    mathematicians, hobbyists and researchers in many other
                    fields. Now, two physicists have

                      >discovered a connection</a
                    >
                    between aperiodic tilings and a seemingly unrelated branch
                    of computer science: the study of how future quantum
                    computers can encode information to shield it from errors.
                    In a paper posted to the preprint server arxiv.org in
                    November, the researchers showed how to transform Penrose
                    tilings into an entirely new type of quantum
                    error-correcting code. They also constructed similar codes
                    based on two other kinds of aperiodic tiling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the heart of the correspondence is a simple observation:
                    In both aperiodic tilings and quantum error-correcting
                    codes, learning about a small part of a large system reveals
                    nothing about the system as a whole.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ...in 1995, the applied mathematician Peter Shor
                    <a
                      href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R2493"

                    >
                    a clever way to store quantum information. His encoding had
                    two key properties. First, it could tolerate errors that
                    only affected individual qubits. Second, it came with a
                    procedure for correcting errors as they occurred, preventing
                    them from piling up and derailing a computation. Shor's
                    discovery was the first example of a quantum
                    error-correcting code, and its two key properties are the
                    defining features of all such codes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ...An infinite two-dimensional plane covered with Penrose
                    tiles, like a grid of qubits, can be described using the
                    mathematical framework of quantum physics: The quantum
                    states are specific tilings instead of 0s and 1s. An error
                    simply deletes a single patch of the tiling pattern, the way
                    certain errors in qubit arrays wipe out the state of every
                    qubit in a small cluster.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The next step was to identify tiling configurations that
                    wouldn't be affected by localized errors, like the virtual
                    qubit states in ordinary quantum error-correcting codes. The
                    solution, as in an ordinary code, was to use superpositions.
                    A carefully chosen superposition of Penrose tilings is akin
                    to a bathroom tile arrangement proposed by the world's most
                    indecisive interior decorator. Even if a piece of that
                    jumbled blueprint is missing, it won't betray any
                    information about the overall floor plan.

                I wonder... does the Penrose / Einstein principle of
                non-repetition preclude cylindrical, or even donut surface
                topology full tilings? If not, that could solve the infinite
                plane mapping into a physically realizable quantum computer
                problem. I do wonder, but not enough to give up all my other
                work and hobbies to pursue deeply theoretical mathematics being
                heavily studied by thousands of PhD mathematicians less than
                half my age...

                    But opponents argued mankind had been reshaping the planet
                    long before the 1950s, pointing to defining moments like the
                    advent of farming and the industrial revolution.

                    [...] "I feel this has been a missed opportunity to
                    recognise and endorse a simple reality, that our planet left
                    its natural functioning state in the mid-20th century," Dr
                    Head, a professor of earth sciences at Brock University in
                    Canada, told AFP.

                    There was no disagreement that 'the age of man' had resulted
                    in profound planetary changes, said Dr Erle Ellis, an
                    environmental scientist critical of the Anthropocene
                    proposal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But scientists weren't convinced this impact represented an
                    epoch, no less one that definitively began only seven
                    decades ago, said Dr Ellis, professor of geography and
                    environmental systems at the University of Maryland.

                    "The truth is, there was never a need for a firm boundary.
                    It just wasn't the critical thing," he told AFP earlier this
                    month after the proposal was first voted down.

                    Tennessee governor Bill Lee signed the ELVIS Act into law
                    Thursday (Mar. 21), legislation designed to further protect
                    the state's artists from artificial intelligence deep fakes.
                    The bill, more formally named the Ensuring Likeness Voice
                    and Image Security Act of 2024, replaces the state's old
                    right of publicity law, which only included explicit
                    protections for one's "name, photograph, or likeness,"
                    expanding protections to include voice- and AI-specific
                    concerns for the first time.

                    than any other state," Lee told reporters shortly after
                    signing the bill into law. "Artists have intellectual
                    property. They have gifts. They have a uniqueness that is
                    theirs and theirs alone, certainly not artificial

                    photographs and likeness are considered a property right
                    rather than a right of publicity. According to the newly
                    signed statute — dubbed the Ensuring Likeness, Voice, and
                    Image Security Act or "ELVIS Act" — vocal likeness will now
                    be added to that list.

                Ostensibly this right is already protected in many states, even

                    restaurants and sports facilities—not the everyday office
                    visit or school drop-off—accounted for the majority of
                    differences in economic outcomes between neighborhoods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lesson for urban planners and individuals, researchers
                    said, is to embrace the unusual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The activities with the strongest predictive power
                    included French and New American restaurants, golf courses,
                    hockey rinks, soccer games, and bagel shops. These kinds of
                    activities accounted for just 2% of trips but explained more
                    than 50% of the variation in economic outcomes between
                    neighborhoods. Wang and his collaborators didn't initially
                    expect these leisure activities to be so tied to local
                    economic fortunes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Those irregular and infrequent activities are
                    correlated with explorative behavior, the tendency of some
                    groups to seek out opportunities, connect with different
                    people, and create new businesses," said Esteban Moro,
                    Ph.D., a professor at Northeastern University, who co-led
                    the study. "Looking at those infrequent activities, we are
                    directly looking at current and potential economic
                    opportunities in the future."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] What was most surprising was that trips to the
                    office—where we earn our money—were not strongly associated
                    with income or property values. Rather, it's how we spend
                    our free time that drives the economic vibrancy of cities.

                    KrebsOnSecurity also reported that Shelest's email address
                    was used circa 2010 by an affiliate of
                    <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=spamit">Spamit</a>,
                    a Russian-language organization that paid people to
                    aggressively promote websites hawking male enhancement drugs
                    and generic pharmaceuticals. As noted in the March 14 story,
                    this connection was confirmed by research from multiple
                    graduate students at my alma mater George Mason University.

                  <p>
                    Shelest denied ever being associated with Spamit. "Between
                    2010 and 2014, we put up some web pages and optimize them —
                    a widely used SEO practice — and then ran AdSense banners on
                    them," Shelest said, presumably referring to the dozens of
                    people-search domains KrebsOnSecurity found were connected
                    to his email addresses (dmitrcox@gmail.com and
                    dmitrcox2@gmail.com). "As we progressed and learned more, we
                    saw that a lot of the inquiries coming in were for people."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The March 14 story on Onerep was the second in a
                    series of three investigative reports published here this
                    month that examined the data broker and people-search
                    industries, and highlighted the need for more congressional
                    oversight — if not regulation — on consumer data protection
                    and privacy.

                    Lyme disease, a bacterial infection transmitted by ticks,
                    affects nearly half a million people in the United States
                    every year. In most cases, antibiotics effectively clear the
                    infection, but for some patients, symptoms linger for months
                    or years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at MIT and the University of Helsinki have now
                    discovered that human sweat contains a protein that can
                    protect against Lyme disease. They also found that about
                    one-third of the population carries a genetic variant of
                    this protein that is associated with Lyme disease in
                    genome-wide association studies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This protein may provide some protection from Lyme
                    disease, and we think there are real implications here for a
                    preventative and possibly a therapeutic based on this
                    protein," says Michal Caspi Tal, a principal research
                    scientist in MIT's Department of Biological Engineering and
                    one of the senior authors of the new study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This finding opens the door to a completely new
                    approach to preventing Lyme disease in the first place, and
                    it will be interesting to see if it could be useful for
                    preventing other types of skin infections too," says Kara
                    Spiller, a professor of biomedical innovation in the School
                    of Biomedical Engineering at Drexel University, who was not
                    involved in the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers note that people who have the protective
                    version of SCGB1D2 can still develop Lyme disease, and they
                    should not assume that they won't. One factor that may play
                    a role is whether the person happens to be sweating when
                    they're bitten by a tick carrying Borrelia burgdorferi.

                    Theories on why leafhoppers coat themselves with a
                    brochosome armor have ranged from keeping them free of
                    contaminants and water to a superhero-like invisibility
                    cloak. However, a new understanding of their geometry raises
                    a strong possibility that its main purpose could be the
                    cloak to avoid predators, according to Tak-Sing Wong,
                    professor of mechanical engineering and biomedical
                    engineering and corresponding author of the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers have found that the size of the holes in the
                    brochosome that give it a hollow, soccer ball-like
                    appearance is extremely important. The size is consistent
                    across leafhopper species, no matter the size of the
                    insect's body. The brochosomes are roughly 600 nanometers in
                    diameter—about half the size of a single bacterium—and the
                    brochosome pores are around 200 nanometers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That makes us ask a question," Wong said. "Why this
                    consistency? What is the secret of having brochosomes of
                    about 600 nanometers with about 200-nanometer pores? Does
                    that serve some purpose?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers found the unique design of brochosomes
                    serves a dual purpose—absorbing ultraviolet (UV) light,
                    which reduces visibility to predators with UV vision, such
                    as birds and reptiles, and scattering visible light,
                    creating an anti-reflective shield against potential
                    threats. The size of the holes is perfect for absorbing
                    light at the ultraviolet frequency.

                    that allow hackers to extract encryption keys. This issue is
                    unpatchable, which means every Mac user could be
                    compromised, but it doesn’t mean you should freak out.

                    [...] The researcher named this vulnerability
                    <a href="https://gofetch.fail/">GoFetch</a>, a
                    “microarchitectural side-channel attack that can extract
                    secret keys from constant-time cryptographic implementations
                    via data memory-dependent prefetchers (DMPs).”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They have found this issue with M1 Mac devices but found
                    that M2 and M3 CPUs also exhibit “similar exploitable DMP
                    behavior.” They have not tested with other chip variants,
                    such as M1 Max, M2 Pro, etc., but the researchers
                    hypothesize that they’re likely to be exploited as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers say that the best way to protect yourself is
                    by constantly updating your Mac to the latest version of
                    <a
                      href="https://bgr.com/guides/macos-14-sonoma-release-date-features-mac-compatibility/"

                    >. For developers of cryptographic libraries, they can
                    either set the DOIT bit and DIT bit bits, which disable the
                    DMP on some CPUs, such as M3 processors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the best way to avoid this attack is by preventing
                    others from physically accessing your M1 Mac computer:
                    “Preventing attackers from measuring DMP activation in the
                    first place, for example, by avoiding hardware sharing, can
                    further enhance the security of cryptographic protocols.”

                    [...] Specifically defendants point to Section 230 of the
                    Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C. § 230 ("CDA" or § 230
                    ) as requiring dismissal of the plaintiffs' complaint... In
                    New York, the Court of Appeals followed other Courts
                    interpretations of the CDA in Shiamili v. Real Estate Group
                    of New York,<br />Inc. (17 NY3d 281 [2011]). The Court found
                    determining immunity from state law liability under Section
                    230 of the CDA requires the Court to take into
                    consideration, "if (1) [defendant] is a provider or user of
                    an interactive computer service; (2) the complaint seeks to
                    hold the defendant liable as a publisher or speaker; and (3)
                    the action is based on information given by another
                    information content provider" (Shiamili at 286-287).

                  <p>
                    On the other hand, plaintiffs contend the defendants
                    platforms should be considered "products" which makes
                    Section 230 irrelevant. Under that premise, what constitutes
                    a product under New York law is not confined to tangible
                    chattels... The Court of Appeals also emphasized the
                    following factors in determining whether an item is a
                    product:
                    <i
                      >(1) a defendant's control over the design and
                      standardization of the product, (2) the party responsible
                      for placing the product into the stream of commerce and
                      deriving a financial benefit, and (3) a party's superior
                      ability to know—and warn about—the dangers inherent in the
                      product's reasonably foreseeable uses or misuses.</i
                    ><br />...<br />Many of the social media/internet defendants
                    have attempted to establish that their platforms are mere
                    message boards and/or do not contain algorithms subjecting
                    them to the protections of the CDA and/or First Amendment.
                    This may ultimately prove true. In addition, some defendants
                    may yet establish that their platforms are not products or
                    that the negligent design features plaintiffs have alleged
                    are not part of their platforms. However, at this stage of
                    the litigation the Court must base its ruling on the
                    allegations of the complaint and not "facts" asserted by the
                    defendants in their briefs or during oral argument and those
                    allegations allege viable causes of action under a products
                    liability theory.

                    [...] This week, a group of white hat hackers released the
                    research from an in-depth study into a particular set of
                    security vulnerabilities — known as "Unsaflok," named after
                    the Dormakaba-branded Saflok door locks that they target.
                    The study that resulted in Unsaflok's discovery was
                    originally conducted in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2022; a city
                    that has seen its fair share of brutal cyberattacks like the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.slashgear.com/1391747/mgm-casino-cyberattack-slot-machines-atm-shut-down/"
                      >2022 MGM casino hack</a
                    >. The vulnerability the researchers discovered is equal
                    parts dangerous and simple: All it takes is a couple of
                    quick taps with an ordinary card key, and anyone could
                    theoretically break into a hotel room.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Saflok locking systems are installed on hotel rooms all over
                    the world; with around 3 million doors in 13,000 properties
                    across 131 countries estimated to have doors installed
                    according to the researchers'
                    <a href="https://unsaflok.com/">disclosed information</a>.
                    Even though all of these doors are in different locations
                    and under different owners, this single exploit could take
                    advantage of every one of them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The vulnerability revolves around the RFID keycards that the
                    Saflok system reads, which utilize a system called MIFARE
                    Classic. If a hacker were to obtain any two MIFARE keycards,
                    even just from renting out a couple of rooms in a hotel
                    themselves, they could then use a generic RFID read-write
                    device to instantly alter their contents. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The bad news is that, due to the complexity of the
                    systems involved in managing hotel door locks, the process
                    has been slow-going. In addition to individually updating
                    the software in every single lock, all of the relevant
                    keycards need to be reissued, and the front desk management
                    software needs to be overhauled. As of March 2024, only
                    around 36% of the affected Saflok systems have been replaced
                    or updated, according to the researchers' report.

                  <p>
                    After winning the IOCCC for the first time, I had the idea
                    of writing an emulator of the 8080 processor in 2000
                    characters of C, after patterning experimentally the more
                    than 200 instructions and doing measures of byte count, I
                    realized that it was possible and I made it. Then I added
                    CP/M support as a extra feature. I was completely astonished
                    when I won Best of Show of 19th IOCCC :).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This emulator was developed eighteen years ago when
                    the computers had 32-bit processors and it used a hole in
                    the C language syntax where you could pass a pointer on an
                    integer. In fact, this is the IOCCC objective: make C
                    compilers to do things these shouldn't be supposed to do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the C compilers for 64-bit processors don't allow
                    it any more as pointers are 64-bit and the int types are
                    32-bit, so compilers stop with an error (especially in macOS
                    because clang).

                    • Seven case studies of sponsorship deals with major
                    polluters are presented. Secrecy is a barrier to knowing the
                    size of many sponsorship deals. But one multi- million euro,
                    publicly reported deal between the International Ski &amp;
                    Snowboard Federation (FIS) with car maker Audi we calculate
                    will generate between 103,000–144,000 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>e
                    (equivalent to burning between 238,000 and 333,000 barrels
                    of oil ).³
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    • In the other cases, and based on reasonable estimates,
                    named companies' sponsorship deals with snowsport
                    organisations are estimated to generate between 11,500 and
                    192,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e each.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    • The report concludes that winter sports athletes,
                    organisations and event organisers must take responsibility,
                    end polluting sponsorships, and stop winter sports being
                    used as a billboard by companies whose activities are
                    destroying the sports' future.

                Tobacco analogies are made. The report ends with a call to cease
                sponsorship deals with companies that are major drivers of
                climate change, pointing in particular at oil and gas companies,
                manufacturers of fossil-fueled cars, and airlines.

                A lot of places have already had to shorten or even move their
                winter sports seasons due to lack of once-abundant snow.

                    animation toolchain and Nanite, Epic's ambitious polygon
                    rendering system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Amy Hennig, known for her work on the Uncharted series,
                    demonstrated the developments by revealing her studio's new
                    game – 1943: Rise of Hydra. Planned for a 2025 release, the
                    title stars Captain America and Black Panther in occupied
                    Paris during World War II.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the game's unveiling, which starts around the
                    19-minute mark in the video below, didn't include gameplay,
                    Hennig proved that the trailer was running in real-time by
                    exploring its scenes and characters using the Unreal Engine
                    editor. The developers took the opportunity to showcase the
                    newly introduced Nanite tessellation, which adds detail to
                    objects without rendering additional polygons. They also
                    demonstrated systems that can quickly change environmental
                    textures and cast realistic shadows on smoke or fog.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, Hennig explained how Unreal Engine 5's motion
                    capture system combines with its advanced MetaHuman
                    character creator to allow realistic facial animations
                    recorded from live actors. Version 5.4's primary addition to
                    animation is Motion Matching, which blends positions to
                    animate in-game characters efficiently. Fortnite has been
                    exhibiting the system since the launch of Chapter 5, and
                    Epic used the GDC presentation to announce significant
                    additions to the game's custom creation tools.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                Why was Michael David Crawford different? - well, he wasn't. In
                many ways he was just like many of us. By profession he was a
                software engineer. He wrote software for OSX. He first became
                well known - or reasonably so in our circles - for being on
                Kuro5hin. However, he was certainly different from many of us
                for the physical and mental health, and social problems that he
                experienced. Despite all of these things though he remained
                polite and open to having an interesting discussion on any
                technical issue that arose, both on Kuro5hin and subsequently
                here on SN. Someone who knew him far better than I did wrote
                about him

                some 12 years ago. If you search on your favourite search engine
                I think that you will find his name appears quite a few times.

                is still there for all to read although it does not do him
                justice. He was a 'nice guy' and intelligent too.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, in 2010 he was

                others might

                  >want to hear him sing</a
                >
                and elsewhere he thought that we all ought to know that

                  >he invented the internet</a
                >. That last link perhaps shows the battle that he was having
                with mental problems yet here on this site he remained the same
                old 'MDC' that we had known since the start of SN and even
                before then for some of us.

                    Remember him. A good person, sometimes bewildered at the
                    senseless cruelty of others, and at his best, indignant and
                    retributive against those cruelties. Not a Vigilante, just a
                    human who wanted children to be safe. Smart but too much of
                    a misfit for society to let him live happily and
                    productively for very long at a stretch.

                    The research review, known as the PlastChem report, was
                    released on Thursday and comes ahead of the next round of
                    negotiations for a

                    Researchers, who spent a year combing through research
                    reports, sorted chemicals used in plastics based on their
                    environmental and health effects – information the team
                    hopes will inform governmental regulations and
                    <a

                    >
                    to curb plastic use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The review found that there are more plastic chemicals than
                    previously known, and 4,200 (26 per cent) of these
                    compounds, including those used as raw ingredients,
                    stabilisers and colourants, are of concern due to their
                    "persistent, bioaccumulative, mobile and/or toxic" nature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] More than 400 of the chemicals identified in the
                    report are in every major commonly used plastic product such
                    as food packaging, and all the tested plastics leached
                    hazardous chemicals into the environment, researchers noted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While about 1,000 plastic chemicals are regulated by
                    global treaties such as the Stockholm Convention on
                    Persistent Organic Pollutants, thousands more are not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The PlastChem report is a wake-up call to
                    policymakers and industry. We need more transparency and
                    better management of chemicals of concern in plastic," Hans
                    Peter Arp, a co-author of the report from the Norwegian
                    University of Science and Technology (NTNU), said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The future of innovation in plastic should focus on safety,
                    sustainability, and necessity, rather than just
                    functionality," Dr Arp said.

                    provision in a tender offer agreement," attorney and stock

                    also unusual for a traditional venture-based startup to have
                    repurchase rights for vested shares that are unrelated to a

                    These terms "keep everyone under their control, even if they

                    employees don't want to be forced to return their valuable
                    SpaceX stock for no compensation. "And since there is no
                    urgency by SpaceX to go public, being banned from tender
                    offers effectively zeros out your shares, at least for a
                    long time. Even though you paid thousands to cover the

                    The new biography Steve Jobs contains a remarkable claim
                    about the power supply of the Apple II and its designer Rod
                    Holt:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        Instead of a conventional linear power supply, Holt
                        built one like those used in oscilloscopes. It switched
                        the power on and off not sixty times per second, but
                        thousands of times; this allowed it to store the power
                        for far less time, and thus throw off less heat. "That
                        switching power supply was as revolutionary as the Apple
                        II logic board was," Jobs later said. "Rod doesn't get a
                        lot of credit for this in the history books but he
                        should. Every computer now uses switching power
                        supplies, and they all rip off Rod Holt's design."
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    I found it amazing to think that computers now use power
                    supplies based on the Apple II's design, so I did some
                    investigation. It turns out that Apple's power supply was
                    not revolutionary, either in the concept of using a
                    switching power supply for computers or in the specific
                    design of the power supply. Modern computer power supplies
                    are totally different and do not rip off anything from Rod
                    Holt's design. It turns out that Steve Jobs was making his
                    customary claim that everyone is stealing Apple's
                    revolutionary technology, entirely contrary to the facts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The history of switching power supplies turns out to be
                    pretty interesting. While most people view the power supply
                    as a boring metal box, there's actually a lot of
                    technological development behind it. There was, in fact, a
                    revolution in power supplies in the late 1960s through the
                    mid 1970s as switching power supplies took over from simple
                    but inefficient linear power supplies, but this was a few
                    years before the Apple II came out in 1977. The credit for
                    this revolution should go to advances in semiconductor
                    technology, specifically improvements in switching
                    transistors, and then innovative ICs to control switching
                    power supplies.

                  There is little evidence that partial automation has any
                  safety benefits, so it's essential that these systems can only
                  be used when proven safety features are engaged. These include
                  seat belts, AEB and lane departure prevention. For a good
                  rating in this category, a partial automation system should
                  not switch on if the driver is unbelted or AEB or lane
                  departure prevention is not active. If already in operation
                  and the driver unfastens their seat belt, the system should
                  immediately begin its multi-mode, driver-disengagement
                  attention reminders. Finally, it must be impossible to switch
                  off AEB or lane departure prevention if the automation is
                  engaged.
                  <p>
                    The hands-free ProPILOT Assist 2.0, Lexus Teammate, and GM
                    Super Cruise systems are the only ones that meet all these
                    requirements. The hands-on ProPILOT Assist with Navi-link
                    and the BMW system come close, but each deactivates without
                    issuing an alert when a key safety feature is disengaged.
                    This is dangerous because the driver may not be aware that
                    they need to resume full control of the vehicle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In contrast, most of the systems fail multiple safety
                    feature requirements. Volvo Pilot Assist, for example,
                    deactivates without an alert when the driver unbuckles, can
                    be activated with lane departure prevention turned off and
                    also remains active if the feature is switched off
                    mid-drive. The two Genesis systems fail all safety feature
                    requirements.

                    In 2019, astronomers discovered a group of white dwarfs that
                    mysteriously stopped cooling. These "forever-young" stars
                    remain at a near-constant surface temperature for at least
                    eight billion years—an incredible length of time,
                    considering the universe is 13.8 billion years old.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Something is fueling these stars from within, but given that
                    they had run out of their nuclear fuel source, scientists
                    were unsure what could be keeping them shining so brightly.
                    Our research, recently published in Nature, presents the
                    solution to this conundrum.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using information gathered by the Gaia space observatory of
                    the European Space Agency, researchers discovered that some
                    white dwarfs essentially stop cooling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By studying how white dwarfs are distributed as a function
                    of temperature (from hot to cold) in the Gaia data,
                    astronomers noticed an accumulation of white dwarfs at
                    intermediate temperatures. This indicates that some white
                    dwarfs spend more time at these intermediate
                    temperatures—eight billion years more than thought possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    White dwarfs are weird. A mere teaspoon of material from
                    their cores weighs several tons. Under such extreme
                    densities, matter can behave strangely. Even though the
                    interiors of white dwarfs are millions of degrees hot, the
                    density is high enough that they can freeze into a solid
                    state. They form crystals out of the carbon, oxygen and
                    other elements present in their interiors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The formation of these crystals normally starts at the
                    center of the star, where density is highest. As the white
                    dwarf cools down, more crystals are formed in successive
                    layers until almost the whole star is completely solid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, this inside-out crystallization does not apply to
                    all white dwarfs. We discovered that the heaviest elements
                    present in white dwarfs are expelled from the crystals as
                    they are formed, just as salt is expelled from ice crystals
                    when seawater freezes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The crystals become less dense than their surroundings, and
                    float up like ice cubes in a glass of water. As the crystals
                    do not stay in place, the core cannot simply freeze from the
                    inside out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The movements created by the floating crystals reshuffle the
                    chemical layering inside the star. Gradually, the heaviest
                    elements are transported toward the center. This releases a
                    steady flow of gravitational energy that keeps the star
                    shining at a near-constant temperature for billions of
                    years.

                    I had to create scans of a small flex PCB to capture more
                    details than a flat scanner could give me. Of course, this
                    task turned out harder than I imagined. I already had a good
                    camera, but I was lacking a good macro lens. Buying one
                    turned out to be hard because the highest magnification
                    ratios on most macro lenses are 1:1. The better ones are, of
                    course, pricier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After browsing some extreme macrophotography forums, I
                    discovered that some people use microscope objectives with
                    their cameras.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those microscope objectives are divided into two groups:
                    infinity-corrected and non-infinity-corrected. What does
                    this mean? The non-infinity-corrected objective focuses the
                    captured image on a plane some distance after the objective.
                    The infinity-corrected objective collimates the captured
                    light into a parallel beam. The second type is useful if you
                    need to Fourier transform the image by transparency masks or
                    do other fancy scientific image transformations. Filtering
                    light is easier if you work with a parallel beam. To use
                    this type of objective in macrophotography, you need an
                    additional lens to focus the parallel beam to an image on
                    the sensor plane.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first type of microscope objective can be used directly
                    with your interchangeable lens camera. The only thing you
                    need is an extension tube, which can be 3D printed in an
                    hour. I found a great Thingiverse repository that contains
                    extension tubes for microscopic objectives with various
                    camera mounts. Together with the cheapest 4X
                    non-infinity-corrected, achromatic microscope objective
                    gives decent results.

                Herb Sutter has an interesting article on his blog about
                approaches to improve security in C++ and modifying the language
                to assist with stopping programming errors that lead to
                exploits.

                There are two interesting insights. Firstly. most CVEs come from
                issues that could be dealt with with small changes to C++ that
                are being proposed.<br />The second is that even coding in
                languages with automatic memory allocation can still have
                massive vulnerabilties. Even code written in Rust has
                vulnerabilities so the language alone is not the whole problem.

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>In that context, I'll focus on C++ and try to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      highlight what needs attention (what C++'s problem "is"),
                      and how we can get there by building on solutions already
                      underway;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      address some common misconceptions (what C++'s problem
                      "isn't"), including practical considerations of MSLs; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      leave a call to action for programmers using all
                      languages.

                  <p>
                    tl;dr: I don't want C++ to limit what I can express
                    efficiently. I just want C++ to let me enforce our
                    already-well-known safety rules and best practices by
                    default, and make me opt out explicitly if that's what I
                    want. Then I can still use fully modern C++... just nicer.

                    The first flying taxi could take off in the UK by 2026 and
                    become a regular sight in our skies two years later, if a
                    government announcement goes to plan. The Future of Flight
                    action plan, developed with the aerospace industry, also
                    says drones and other flying vehicles will become more
                    autonomous. It predicts that the first pilotless flying taxi
                    will take off in 2030.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But experts say hurdles such as infrastructure and public
                    acceptance need to be overcome first.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are a number of different models, but most flying
                    taxis look like a futuristic helicopter and can usually
                    carry about five people. They are part of a family of
                    vehicles called "eVTOLs" - which stands for electric
                    vertical take-off and landing aircraft. The technology for
                    them exists now, but it is likely that the aircraft will
                    start off as exclusive modes of transport - replacing
                    expensive journeys currently done by helicopters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Department for Transport also plans to allow drones to
                    fly beyond visual line of sight - meaning the person
                    controlling the drone cannot see it in the air. Some of the
                    uses of unmanned drones include transporting medical
                    supplies, delivering post in rural areas and tracking down
                    criminals on the run. Their use is still in early stages,
                    but the plan suggests drone deliveries would be commonplace
                    by 2027.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The biggest obstacles to getting flying taxis into the air
                    are infrastructure and public perception, says Craig
                    Roberts, head of drones, at consultancy firm PwC.

                    [...] No other mini airports have been built or trialled
                    since the demonstration two years ago. But according to the
                    government plan, the first vertiport (airport for vertical
                    vehicles) will be operational this year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The UK's aerospace regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority,
                    is consulting on proposals for vertiports at existing
                    aerodromes. New regulation would almost certainly need to be
                    created if the government's aim of bringing in autonomous
                    air taxis by 2030 is to be met.

                    Vegetation plays a vital role in regulating the percentage
                    of precipitation reaching the ground to nourish the root
                    systems of plants both in the canopy and undergrowth, which
                    consequently supports the survival of the entire forest
                    ecosystem. Water arrives to the ground via multiple
                    mechanisms, including throughfall (water falling directly
                    through the canopy) or stemflow (water flowing down stems
                    and trunks), while some is intercepted by the canopy leaves
                    and does not reach ground level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    New research, published in Water Resources Research, has
                    focused on pour points, locations where water flowing under
                    the branches detach. These are distinguished from the large
                    drops falling from leaves, known as drip points.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A pour point is formed when the raindrops, initially
                    intercepted by leaves or the top half of the branch, flow to
                    the underside of branches, coalesce with other droplets to
                    form a rivulet, but fall before becoming a part of stemflow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The detachment of the rivulet can occur where multiple
                    branches converge or where a single branch changes in angle,
                    leading to a pour point. These are important as they
                    considerably increase water received from the canopy to the
                    forest floor at fixed points, thereby supporting enhanced
                    infiltration of water to the ground.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The volume of water received at pour points is impacted by a
                    number of factors, such as the structure of the branches,
                    leaf surface area (foliation), and the volume of rainfall.
                    The larger water droplets occurring at these points have
                    more kinetic energy than normal rainfall, meaning that they
                    create more pronounced dips in the soil upon impact, thus
                    augmenting infiltration efficiency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Measuring the water content of soil directly below
                    pour points, the research team found 20%–30% of the seasonal
                    rainfall volume infiltrated to a depth of 1 m here, compared
                    to just 5% in control test areas away from pour points. This
                    makes pour points important zones for groundwater recharge
                    and storage in the forest ecosystem, although in the study
                    site one pour point was identified per ~30 m2, matching the
                    distribution of banksia trees, being one pour point per tree
                    on average.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This particular study site in Western Australia is important
                    as it overlies a significant source of groundwater that
                    supplies the population of Perth. Therefore, the ability of
                    pour points to potentially recharge groundwater supplies at
                    this site (and at others via other trees globally), is vital
                    for supporting water resources management both for forests
                    and humanity.

              <p>Just a brief update - but welcome news for a change.</p>
              <p>
                After a long wait (and after a query to the IRS regarding the
                progress of our application), fliptop has received news verbally
                that we have been <b>approved</b> by the IRS for Not For Profit
                status. The essential paperwork should be with fliptop by the
                end of the week. Once it has been received we can then move
                ahead to create a company. Again, we cannot guess how long this
                process will take but it is the final step required before the
                community can take control of the site and its assets.

                    "supercharge" and revolutionize the way it wields artificial
                    intelligence for its customers<strong>.</strong>

                    Cisco announced plans to acquire software company Splunk in
                    September 2023 and announced the completion of the deal on
                    Monday in a press release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The acquisition of Splunk now makes Cisco one of the largest
                    software companies in the world, Cisco said in the release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We will revolutionize the way our customers leverage data
                    to connect and protect every aspect of their organization as
                    we help power and protect the AI revolution," Cisco CEO
                    Chuck Robbins said in a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Cisco acquired Splunk for roughly $28 billion, or
                    about $157 per share in cash, the companies said. Combined,
                    Cisco and Splunk "can create new profitable revenue
                    streams," they said.

                    To bolster weight-bearing capacity, many researchers have
                    attempted to thicken their paper-thin designs in varying
                    spots. U-M's team, however, found that uniformity is key.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What happens is you add one level of thickness here, and a
                    different level of thickness there, and it becomes
                    mismatched," Filipov said. "So when the load is carried
                    through these components, it starts to cause bending.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That uniformity of the component's thickness is what's key
                    and what's missing from many current origami systems. When
                    you have that, together with appropriate locking devices,
                    the weight placed upon a structure can be evenly transferred
                    throughout."

                    In the attack, hackers create an app that injects malicious
                    code into the Meta Quest VR system and then launch a clone
                    of the VR system's home screen and apps that looks identical
                    to the user's original screen. Once inside, attackers can
                    see, record, and modify everything the person does with the
                    headset. That includes tracking voice, gestures, keystrokes,
                    browsing activity, and even the user's social interactions.
                    The attacker can even change the content of a user's

                  <p>
                    A spokesperson for Meta said the company plans to review the
                    findings: "We constantly work with academic researchers as
                    part of our bug bounty program and other initiatives."

                    VR headsets have slowly become more popular in recent years,
                    but security research has lagged behind product development,
                    and current defenses against attacks in VR are lacking.
                    What's more, the immersive nature of virtual reality makes
                    it harder for people to realize they've fallen into a trap.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The shock in this is how fragile the VR systems of today
                    are," says Heather Zheng, a professor of computer science at
                    the University of Chicago, who led the team behind the
                    research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The inception attack exploits a loophole in Meta Quest
                    headsets: users must enable "developer mode" to download
                    third-party apps, adjust their headset resolution, or
                    screenshot content, but this mode allows attackers to gain
                    access to the VR headset if they're using the same Wi-Fi
                    network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Developer mode is supposed to give people remote access for
                    debugging purposes. However, that access can be repurposed
                    by a malicious actor to see what a user's home screen looks
                    like and which apps are installed. (Attackers can also
                    strike if they are able to access a headset physically or if
                    a user downloads apps that include malware.) With this
                    information, the attacker can replicate the victim's home
                    screen and applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then the attacker stealthily injects an app with the
                    inception attack in it. The attack is activated and the VR
                    headset hijacked when unsuspecting users exit an application
                    and return to the home screen. The attack also captures the
                    user's display and audio stream, which can be livestreamed
                    back to the attacker.

                    If you're a PC hardware geek who's been dreaming of a laptop
                    that you can upgrade far beyond the life cycle of a typical
                    machine, Framework's modular notebooks must seem like a
                    miracle. The American company has a straightforward pitch:
                    What if your laptop could be nearly as customizable as a
                    desktop, with the ability to swap components out for repairs
                    and upgrades? What if we could put an end to disposable
                    hardware? We were intrigued by Framework's original 13-inch
                    notebook and its Chromebook variant, despite some rough
                    edges and a basic design. Now, with the Framework Laptop 16,
                    the company is targeting the most demanding and (arguably)
                    hardest group of PC users to please: Gamers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Framework has already proved it can build compelling modular
                    laptops, but can the Laptop 16 cram in powerful graphics, a
                    fast display and other components to keep up with the likes
                    of Alienware, Razer and ASUS? Sort of, it turns out — and
                    there are plenty of other tradeoffs for living the modular
                    laptop dream. Hardware quirks abound, battery life is
                    mediocre and it still looks like a totally generic machine.
                    But how many other notebooks could let you completely
                    upgrade your CPU or GPU in a few years? Who else offers a
                    customizable keyboard setup? In those respects, the
                    Framework 16 stands alone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I was genuinely bummed to discover that it was a
                    fairly mediocre gaming machine, at least for its high price.

                What do you think? Is having a laptop that you can upgrade more
                important than having the fastest laptop on the block? What
