                    The next major release of Windows isn't due until the end of
                    the year, but it looks like Microsoft is getting an early
                    start. New Windows Insider builds
                    <a
                      href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/02/08/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26052-canary-and-dev-channels/"
                      >released to the Canary and Dev channels</a
                    >
                    both roll their version numbers to "24H2," indicating that
                    they're the earliest builds of what Microsoft will
                    eventually release to all Windows users sometime this fall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The early change to the 24H2 numbering is a departure
                    from last year, where Windows 11 23H2 didn't appear publicly
                    <a

                      >until the end of October</a
                    >. And even then, it was mostly just an update that rolled
                    over the version number and Microsoft's support clock for
                    software updates—most of its "new" features had actually
                    rolled out to PCs running Windows 11 22H2 the month before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are some signs that this update will be fairly
                    significant in scope. In addition to all the features
                    Microsoft listed, there are signs that the company is
                    revising things

                    that you go through when installing the OS from scratch.

                  <p>
                    [...] A 24H2 update does suggest that Windows 11 will
                    continue on for at least another year, but it doesn't
                    necessarily preclude a Windows 12 launch this year. Windows

                    >
                    the year after that (not that either came with significant
                    new features). Microsoft could decide to rename the upcoming
                    feature update on relatively short notice—like it originally
                    did with Windows 11, which

                    >
                    as a design overhaul for Windows 10. Windows 12 might
                    happen, or it might not, but I wouldn't take this Windows 11
                    24H2 update as decisive evidence one way or the other.

                [With my latest build, I skipped the OS tax, and used MXLinux
                instead. Installation was a little more complicated than a fresh
                windows install. I've also had a few hiccups with game
                compatibility, but overall Steam's Proton compatibility layer is
                doing an even better job than when I last tried it out. For
                example Space Engineers, just worked. Whereas before there were
                audio and graphical issues.]

                    The conceptual demonstration in these optoelectronic
                    metasurfaces have a number of promising applications. The
                    generated charge current can be naturally utilized as the
                    signal for photodetection, particularly important at long
                    wavelength infrared region. The system can serve as a source
                    of terahertz radiation, useful in a range of applications
                    from ultra-high-speed wireless communications to
                    spectroscopy characterization of materials. The system could
                    also offer new opportunities for controlling nanomagnetism,
                    in which the specialized currents may be designed for
                    adaptable, nano-scale magnetic fields.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new capability may also prove important for ultrafast
                    information processing, including computation and
                    microelectronics. The ability to use the laser pulses and
                    metasurfaces for adaptive circuits could allow for the
                    dispatching of slower and less versatile transistor-based
                    computer and electronics architectures. Unlike conventional
                    circuits, adaptive structured light fields could offer
                    completely new design possibilities.

                    What explains the popularity of terminals with 80×24 and
                    80×25 displays? A recent blog post "80x25" motivated me to
                    investigate this. The source of 80-column lines is clearly
                    punch cards, as commonly claimed. But why 24 or 25 lines?
                    There are many theories, but I found a simple answer: IBM,
                    in particular its dominance of the terminal market. In 1971,
                    IBM introduced a terminal with an 80×24 display (the 3270)
                    and it soon became the best-selling terminal, forcing
                    competing terminals to match its 80×24 size. The display for
                    the IBM PC added one more line to its screen, making the
                    80×25 size standard in the PC world. The impact of these
                    systems remains decades later: 80-character lines are still
                    a standard, along with both 80×24 and 80×25 terminal
                    windows.

                    In this blog post, I'll discuss this history in detail,
                    including some other systems that played key roles. The CRT
                    terminal market essentially started with the IBM 2260
                    Display Station in 1965, built from curious technologies
                    such as sonic delay lines. This led to the popular IBM 3270
                    display and then widespread, inexpensive terminals such as
                    the DEC VT100. In 1981, IBM released a microcomputer called
                    the DataMaster. While the DataMaster is mostly forgotten, it
                    strongly influenced the IBM PC, including the display. This
                    post also studies reports on the terminal market from the
                    1970s and 1980s; these make it clear that market forces, not
                    technological forces, led to the popularity of various
                    display sizes.

                Alexey Navalny, Russia's most famous dissident, has died. (4
                June 1976 – 16 February 2024).
              </p>
              <p>
                Returning to Russia in 2021, after having been treated in Berlin
                for novichok poisoning, Navalny was immediately arrested on
                arrival at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. Since then, he has
                been in and out of (but mostly in) solitary confinement all over
                the country, with his final station being the
                <i>Polar Wolf</i> penal colony in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous
                Okrug, Siberia.

                    CNM-Au8 is a concentrated suspension of gold nanocrystals
                    whose surfaces catalyze the rapid oxidation of NADH to NAD+,
                    shown to increase the availability of both NAD<sup>+</sup>
                    and ATP in <em>in vitro</em> studies. It's also known to
                    cross the blood-brain barrier and penetrate cell membranes.
                    [...] All participants received 120 ml of CNM-Au8, which
                    they drank each morning for 12 weeks. Beginning with the
                    baseline visit, participants had ECG, blood tests, physical
                    exams, and scoring of either motor and non-motor Parkinson's
                    symptoms or the degree of disability caused by MS.
                    Phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-MRS) was used
                    to noninvasively assess energy metabolites of the whole
                    brain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] After 12 weeks of treatment with CNM-Au8, the mean
                    change in NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio from baseline across
                    both cohorts demonstrated a statistically significant
                    increase by an average of 10.4%, demonstrating that the gold
                    nanocrystals were targeting the brain as intended. The
                    effect on the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio ceased after the
                    12-week CNM-Au9 treatment was concluded. The researchers
                    also observed an inverse correlation between the baseline
                    and post-treatment levels of ATP and other brain energy
                    metabolites; participants with relatively lower baseline
                    levels demonstrated increases, and participants with
                    relatively higher baseline levels demonstrated a
                    re-balancing that brought levels down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In participants with PD, the treatment produced a
                    statistically significant improvement in scores measuring
                    "motor experiences of daily living," driven mainly by a
                    significant improvement at week four. This score reflects
                    the impact rather than the presence of symptoms and includes
                    an assessment of chewing and swallowing, cutting food and
                    handling utensils, dressing, hygiene, speech, writing,
                    walking, and the interference caused by tremor.

                    most valuable company in the US, behind Microsoft, Apple,
                    and Google parent Alphabet. Reuters reported that when
                    Nvidia first overtook Amazon, it held a stock value of
                    $734.96 per share Monday morning, making Nvidia worth $1.82
                    trillion in market value versus $1.81 trillion for Amazon.
                    As of this writing, the two companies are still close in
                    value, with Nvidia again in the lead.

                    Over the past year, I have published a series of CACM blogs
                    in which I analyzed the introduction of generative AI, in
                    general, and of ChatGPT, in particular, to computer science
                    education (see,

                  <p>
                    One of the messages of these blogs was that computer science
                    high school teachers and computer science freshmen clearly
                    see the potential contribution of ChatGPT to computer
                    science teaching and learning processes and highlight the
                    opportunities it opens for computer science education, over
                    the potential threats it poses. Another message was that
                    generative AI, and specifically LLM-based conversational
                    agents (e.g., ChatGPT), may turn out to be disruptive
                    technologies for computer science education and, therefore,
                    should be conceived of as an opportunity for computer
                    science education to stay relevant.

                  <p>
                    In this blog, we address high school teachers' perspective
                    on the incorporation of ChatGPT into computer science
                    education. [...]

              </blockquote>
              <p>The author then presents the SWOT analysis, concluding:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    With respect to the adoption of generative AI, it seems that
                    the chasm in its adoption process has already been crossed
                    and that, due to the simplicity of using the various
                    generative AI applications available, a huge population,
                    either with or without a technological background, has
                    already adopted them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Based on the SWOT analysis presented above, the meaningful
                    question for our discussion is:
                    <i
                      >With respect to the community of computer science
                      teachers, what stage of the adoption process of innovation

                      crossed?</i

                    I watch a ton of YouTube, on the order of an hour or two
                    each day and I can honestly say the no-ads premium family
                    account on YouTube is one of the best bargains on the
                    internet for everyone in my house.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lately, YouTube creators are going through a reckoning, and
                    I think it's unfortunate to see some creators I've come to
                    know and trust over the years squander their work as they
                    chase percentage points of revenue instead of focusing on
                    the craft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It reminds me a lot of how blogging changed around
                    2005-2009, when ad money came pouring in, and while it was
                    great for bloggers that previously were just publishing for
                    the heck of it (myself included), eventually the money
                    tainted the process as many people rushed to improve their
                    bottom line, often at the expense of whole reason they
                    created their sites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] My hope for YouTube creators is much like bloggers.
                    Don't spend all your time chasing the tea leaves and
                    conventional wisdom. Focus on your channel/site and keep
                    creating things you love that will resonate with your
                    viewers/readers. Hopefully the money will follow, but
                    obsessing over how to eke out every last cent from your work
                    will make your work suffer.

                    by disrupting levels of zinc in our inner ears, a study in
                    mice suggests. Therapies that mitigate this could be used to
                    treat or even prevent such damage, for example if taken
                    before a rock concert.

                    [...] Most of the body's zinc is attached to proteins, but
                    the rest works as a communication signal between organs,
                    especially the brain, says Tzounopoulos. The highest
                    concentration of free zinc in the body is in the cochlea,
                    the snail-shaped structure in the inner ear that converts
                    vibrations into electrical signals, which are then
                    interpreted as

                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers found that these mice had greater
                    amounts of free zinc in between and around the cells in
                    their cochlea after the sound blast compared with before, as
                    well as in comparison to a group of control mice that hadn't
                    heard the loud sounds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There is a very robust upregulation of zinc, in terms of
                    quantity, but also in terms of spatial covering of the
                    area," he says. "It goes everywhere."

                  <p>
                    With further research, zinc-trapping pills, drops or
                    slow-release implants might one day help prevent or treat
                    inner ear damage from noise trauma, says Tzounopoulos.

                  <p>
                    "You could go to a concert or to combat and you could take a
                    pill," he says. "Or you might have an accident, and they
                    could have these compounds in the ER [emergency room] to
                    give you to help mitigate the damage."

                    The most prevalent form of electronics-assisted car theft
                    these days, for instance, uses what are known as
                    <a

                    >
                    against keyless ignition and entry systems. This form of
                    hack works by holding one device near a key fob and a second
                    device near the vehicle the fob works with. In the most
                    typical scenario, the fob is located on a shelf near a
                    locked front door, and the car is several dozen feet away in
                    a driveway. By placing one device near the front door and
                    another one next to the car, the hack beams the radio
                    signals necessary to unlock and start the device.

                    This attack requires a high-power transceiver that's not
                    capable with the Flipper Zero. These attacks are carried out
                    using pricy off-the-shelf equipment and modifying it using a
                    fair amount of expertise in radio frequency
                    communications.<br />[...]<br />"You can't perform a rolljam
                    attack with a single Flipper Zero, and you sure as hell
                    can't use a 64 MHz, 32-bit ARM processor to crack rolling
                    codes," Rob Stumpf, a journalist who covers the intersection
                    of cars and cybersecurity. At most, he said, a Flipper Zero
                    can perform limited attacks on select modern cars, mostly
                    from Honda and Acura, that can unlock and start a vehicle.
                    These sorts of attacks, however, require the thief to be
                    within close proximity of the owner while actively unlocking
                    the car.

                      >CAN-injection attack</a
                    >.<br />[...]<br />"The more common relay attacks used in
                    vehicle thefts are from sophisticated purpose-built tools,"
                    Stumpf said. "Those devices are the real threat—not some kid
                    opening a Tesla charging port with their Flipper Zero."<br />[...]<br />It's
                    not the first time the hobbyist device has been portrayed as
                    a tool for sophisticated crime. That impression is likely
                    the result of a

                    on YouTube and TikTok showing the device used to empty ATMs
                    and unlock cars. In reality, most of those videos were
                    faked, likely by people attempting to drive sales to
                    websites impersonating Flipper Zero vendors. Several months
                    after the appearance of those videos, Amazon stopped selling
                    the product, which it labeled as a "<a

                    Kulagin said that governments in jurisdictions other than
                    Canada have been much more open-minded about the Flipper
                    Zero. One such body was the New Jersey Cybersecurity &amp;
                    Communications Integration Cell, which contacted the device
                    maker directly following the rash of misleading videos.

                    For almost seven years, Cloudflare has been fighting against
                    patent trolls. We've been doing this successfully through
                    the efforts of our own legal team, external counsel, and the
                    extraordinary efforts of people on the Internet looking for
                    prior art (and getting rewarded for it) through our Project
                    Jengo.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While we refuse to pay trolls for their meritless claims,
                    we've been happy to award prizes to Project Jengo
                    participants who help stop the trolls through prior art that
                    invalidates their patents or claims. Project Jengo
                    participants helped us in the past roundly beat the patent
                    troll Blackbird (who subsequently went out of business).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The jury found that Cloudflare did not infringe the
                    patent asserted against Cloudflare by patent trolls Sable IP
                    and Sable Networks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And while that would have been enough to decide the case by
                    itself, the jury went further and found that Sable's old and
                    broadly-written patent claim was invalid and never should
                    have been granted in the first place–meaning they can no
                    longer assert the claim against anyone else. Since Sable
                    first sued us, we've invalidated significant parts of three
                    Sable patents, hamstringing their ability to bring lawsuits
                    against other companies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's worth noting that very few lawsuits ever reach a jury.
                    Most non-lawyers are shocked to learn that only about 1% of
                    civil cases make it to trial, because trials are generally
                    what they see on TV or in film. But professional litigators
                    know that almost all cases are resolved much earlier through
                    procedures that are much less entertaining to watch on
                    screen: written motions, delay, or settlement. A big reason
                    for this is that taking a case to trial–even on simple
                    matters–is extremely costly. In patent cases, that means
                    millions of dollars.

                        Just picked up my Cybertruck today. The advisor
                        specifically mentioned the cybertrucks develop orange
                        rust marks in the rain and that required the vehicle to
                        be buffed out. I know I heard the story of never take
                        out your Delorean in the rain but I just never read
                        anything about rust and Cybertrucks.

                    This, as you might expect, provoked a strong reaction from
                    the faithful. "Liar. Is this fun for you?" one asked, while
                    another incorrectly riposted: "If it 'rusts', it's not
                    stainless steel." This is a common misconception. Stainless
                    steel is resistant to rust, but not completely immune.

                    [....] corrosion reports may stem from owners believing that
                    "ultra-hard stainless steel" doesn't require much care.
                    Tesla, it appears, would vehemently disagree.

                    Clear coat is the outermost layer of transparent paint that
                    serves as a protective barrier, preventing UV radiation and
                    weather from damaging the colored paint layer. Clear coat
                    also takes abrasions that might otherwise scratch the paint

                    An Oregon resident contracted bubonic plague from their
                    "very sick" pet cat, marking the first time since 2015 that
                    someone in the state has been stricken with the Black Death

                    Plague bacteria, Yersinia pestis, circulates cryptically in
                    the US in various types of rodents and their fleas. It
                    causes an average of seven human cases a year, with a range
                    of 1 to 17, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
                    Prevention. The cases tend to cluster in two regions, the
                    CDC notes: a hotspot that spans northern New Mexico,
                    northern Arizona, and southern Colorado, and another region
                    spanning California, far western Nevada, and southern
                    Oregon.

                    The new case in Oregon occurred in the central county of
                    Deschutes. It was fortunately caught early before the
                    infection developed into a more severe, systemic bloodstream
                    infection (septicemic plague).

                    [...] It's unclear how or why the cat became infected. But
                    cats are particularly susceptible to plague and are
                    considered a common source of infection in the US. The
                    animals, when left to roam outdoors, can pick up infections
                    from fleas as well as killing and eating infected rodents.
                    Though dogs can also pick up the infection from fleas or
                    other animals, they are

                  <p>
                    First, the Ovrdrive USB design functions pretty simply. It's
                    mostly a run-of-the-mill USB flash drive with a unique
                    activation mechanism. For it to be detected by your machine,
                    you have to rapidly insert the drive three consecutive times
                    actually to turn it on. Failure to do so will hide the
                    drive's partition and give the impression that it's broken.
                    Initially, it was supposed to self-destruct, but it proved
                    too challenging to mass produce, forcing Walker to change
                    the drive.

                    Damn Small Linux (DSL) has returned with a
                    <a href="https://www.damnsmalllinux.org/"
                      >new 2024 edition</a
                    >. The arrival of DSL 2024 has surprised many, as the last
                    release of this compact Linux OS was more than a decade ago.
                    Over the years DSL has put on weight (haven't we all)
                    inflating from 50MB in 2008 to today's 700MB. That sounds
                    like a lot, but the philosophy of making a usable desktop
                    distribution for older PCs with limited hardware resources
                    is similar. Moreover "applications, the kernel, and drivers
                    have all mushroomed," explains John Andrews, the driving
                    force behind this project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Originally, DSL was launched as a
                    <a
                      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootable_business_card"
                      >business card-size</a
                    >
                    live CD Linux distribution based on Debian and Knoppix. The
                    relaunched version [is] a Debian and antiX distribution,
                    will still run from a live CD, but it needs a full-sized CD.
                    Andrews asserts that 700MB is a new hard limit for DSL going
                    forward, and it needs to be for standard CDR compatibility.

                    It turns out some of the informed speculation about the US
                    military's latest X-37B spaceplane mission was pretty much
                    spot-on.

                    When the semi-classified winged spacecraft launched on
                    December 28, it flew into orbit on top of a SpaceX Falcon
                    Heavy rocket, which is much larger than the Atlas V and
                    Falcon 9 rockets used to launch the X-37B on its previous
                    missions. [...] This immediately sparked speculation that
                    the X-37B would reach higher altitudes than its past
                    flights, which remained in low-Earth orbit at altitudes of a
                    few hundred miles. A discovery from Tomi Simola, a satellite
                    tracking hobbyist living near Helsinki, Finland, appears to
                    confirm this suspicion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Friday, Simola reported on social media and on SeeSat-L,
                    a long-running online forum of satellite tracking
                    enthusiasts, that he detected an unidentified object using a
                    sky-watching camera. [...]

                    George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue was premiered one hundred
                    years ago today, on the snowy afternoon of February 12,
                    1924, at Aeolian Hall on Manhattan's West 43rd Street.

                    The 25-year-old composer was at the piano, joined by the
                    dance band of Paul Whiteman, the noted bandleader who
                    commissioned the work. It was presented near the end of a
                    marathon concert, organized and promoted by Whiteman,
                    entitled, An Experiment in Modern Music. Purportedly in
                    attendance were such musical luminaries as Sergei
                    Rachmaninov, Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz, Leopold
                    Stokowski, Ernest Bloch, Igor Stravinsky, Walter Damrosch,
                    Victor Herbert, and John Philip Sousa. Whiteman later
                    recalled that

                        it was a strange audience out front. Vaudevillians,
                        concert managers came to have a look at the novelty, Tin
                        Pan Alleyites, composers, symphony and opera stars,
                        flappers, cake-eaters, all mixed up higgledy-piggledy.

                    A German court has sided with R2 Semiconductor against
                    Intel, ruling that the chip giant infringed one of R2's
                    patent. This decision could lead to sales ban of select
                    Intel processors as well as products based on them in
                    Germany. Intel, for its part, has accused R2 of being a
                    patent troll wielding a low-quality patent, and has said
                    that it will appeal the decision.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The regional court in Düsseldorf, Germany, ruled that Intel
                    infringed a patent covering an integrated voltage regulator
                    technology that belongs to Palo Alto, California-based R2
                    Semiconductor. The court on Wednesday issued an injunction
                    against sales of Intel's Core-series 'Ice Lake,' 'Tiger
                    Lake,' 'Alder Lake,' and Xeon Scalable 'Ice Lake Server'
                    processors as well as PCs and servers based on these CPUs.
                    Some of these processors have already been discontinued, but
                    there are Alder Lake chips are available in retail and
                    inside many systems that are still on the shelves. Though
                    the ruling does not mean that these CPUs will disappear from
                    the German market immediately.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, the injunction does not cover Intel's
                    current-generation Core 'Raptor Lake' and Core Ultra 'Meteor
                    Lake' processors for desktops and laptops, according to
                    <a
                      href="https://www.ft.com/content/981f3b39-30f5-4da2-9819-23bebc1a8846"
                      >The Financial Times</a
                    >, so the impact of the injunction is set to be fairly
                    limited.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Intel has expressed its disappointment with the verdict and
                    announced its intention to challenge the decision. The
                    company criticized R2 Semiconductor's litigation strategy,
                    accusing it of pursuing serial lawsuits against big
                    companies, particularly after Intel managed to invalidate
                    one of R2's U.S. patents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "R2 files serial lawsuits to extract large sums from
                    innovators like Intel," a statement by Intel reads. "R2
                    first filed suit against Intel in the U.S., but after Intel
                    invalidated R2's low-quality U.S. patent R2 shifted its
                    campaign against Intel to Europe. Intel believes companies
                    like R2, which appears to be a shell company whose only
                    business is litigation, should not be allowed to obtain
                    injunctions on CPUs and other critical components at the
                    expense of consumers, workers, national security, and the
                    economy."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In its lawsuit against Intel, R2 requested the court to halt
                    sales of infringing processors, sales of products equipped
                    with these CPUs, and to mandate a recall of items containing
                    these processors, as
                    <a

                      >Intel revealed last September</a
                    >. The company contended that imposing an injunction would
                    be an excessive response.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, it is important to note that in this legal battle
                    Intel is safeguarding its customers by assuming
                    responsibility for any legal expenses or compensations they
                    may incur. Consequently, as of September, Intel was unable
                    to provide a reliable estimate of the possible financial
                    impact or the scope of potential losses that could result
                    from the legal battle as they can be vast.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a stark contrast with Intel, R2 welcomes the court's
                    decisions and presents the company's own view on the legal
                    dispute.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are delighted that the highly respected German court has
                    issued an injunction and unequivocally found that Intel has
                    infringed R2's patents for integrated voltage regulators,"
                    said David Fisher, CEO of R2. "We intend to enforce this
                    injunction and protect our valuable intellectual property.

                    Researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical
                    Campus have discovered that odors stimulate specific brain
                    cells that may play a role in rapid "go/no-go"
                    decision-making.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The scientists focused on the hippocampus, an area of the
                    brain crucial to memory and learning. They knew that
                    so-called "time cells" played a major role in hippocampal
                    function, but didn't know their role in associative
                    learning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These are cells that would remind you to make a decision—do
                    this or do that," said the study's senior author Diego
                    Restrepo, Ph.D., a neuroscientist and professor of cell and
                    developmental biology at the University of Colorado School
                    of Medicine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers observed that when mice were given the
                    choice of responding to a fruity smell by licking on a spout
                    that delivered sweet water, they quickly learned to lick the
                    fruity smell as opposed to the smell of mineral oil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "They have to associate the odor with the outcome of what
                    they are doing so that's why they learn decision-making,"
                    said Ming Ma, Ph.D., a first author of the study and a
                    senior instructor in cell and developmental biology at the
                    CU School of Medicine. "When it's a fruit odor, they lick
                    and get a reward. When it's mineral oil, they stop licking."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The more they learned, the more the cells were stimulated,
                    leading to more rapid decoding of the odors and allowing the
                    mice to quickly become proficient at choosing the fruity
                    smell," said Fabio Simoes de Souza, DSc, another first
                    author of the study and an assistant research professor in
                    cell and developmental biology at the CU School of Medicine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The catalyst for the decision-making is the odor that
                    travels up the nose, sending neural signals to the olfactory
                    bulb and to the hippocampus. The two organs are closely
                    connected. The information is swiftly processed and the
                    brain makes a decision based on the input.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Before this we didn't know there were decision-making cells
                    in the hippocampus," Restrepo said. "The hippocampus is
                    multitasking."

                    Brauer’s team analyzed data from 269,725 older male
                    residents (average age 59) who were newly diagnosed with
                    erectile dysfunction and either given a prescription for a
                    PDE5I or not. They then tracked the outcomes of these two
                    groups for five years on average.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By the end of the study period, 1,119 people overall had
                    been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. But those taking a
                    PDE5I were significantly less likely to have Alzheimer’s
                    than those who didn’t—about 18% less likely after adjusting
                    for other potentially important factors. This reduced risk
                    was only clearly seen with sildenafil and not other PDE5Is,
                    but the discrepancy might be due to there being fewer users
                    of these drugs and not any biological difference, Brauer
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    Wednesday in the journal Neurology, suggest a more modest
                    boon from these drugs than the 2021 study. But Brauer’s team
                    was somewhat surprised they found any buffer at all, given
                    that they used a similar method as the 2022 study. The
                    different results might be explained by the longer follow-up
                    data her team had on hand, she said, and she certainly
                    thinks that the research could point to something real.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There are still important questions left to be
                    answered about this link, including exactly how these drugs
                    might work to prevent or delay Alzheimer’s. Since they’re
                    known to relax blood vessels, they could be improving blood
                    flow in the brain enough to have a neuroprotective effect,
                    Brauer said. Based on animal data, they might also be
                    indirectly boosting levels of acetylcholine, a
                    neurotransmitter important to cognition that steadily
                    becomes depleted in those with Alzheimer’s (many Alzheimer’s
                    drugs help manage symptoms by slowing this decline, but they
                    can’t stop it).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Importantly, neither Brauer’s study nor any other to date
                    provides conclusive evidence that PDE5Is can stop
                    Alzheimer’s. But given the urgent need for medicines that
                    can prevent or even just slow down the devastating
                    condition, the authors say these drugs deserve a closer and
                    extensive look from other researchers.

                    The high-profile climate scientist Michael Mann has been
                    awarded $1m by a jury in a defamation lawsuit against two
                    conservative writers who compared his depictions of global
                    heating to the work of a convicted child molester.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The case stretches back 12 years. In a statement posted on
                    Mann's X account, one of his lawyers said: "Today's verdict
                    vindicates Mike Mann's good name and reputation. It also is
                    a big victory for truth and scientists everywhere who
                    dedicate their lives answering vital scientific questions
                    impacting human health and the planet."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Emails from Mann and other scientists were leaked in
                    2009 in an incident known as "Climategate", with climate
                    denialists claiming Mann manipulated data. Investigations by
                    Penn State and others, including an examination of the
                    emails by the Associated Press, found no misuse of data by
                    Mann.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Regardless, in 2012, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a
                    libertarian think tank, published a blogpost by Rand Simberg
                    that compared investigations by Penn State University into
                    Mann's work with the case of Jerry Sandusky, a former
                    assistant football coach who was convicted of sexually
                    assaulting multiple children.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the Mann legal team's statement, the four-week
                    jury trial in the District of Columbia superior court
                    resulted in punitive damages of $1,000 against Simberg and
                    $1,000,000 against Steyn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I hope this verdict sends a message that falsely attacking
                    climate scientists is not protected speech," Mann said.

                    Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance are not keen on the idea of

                    Meta takes issue with the European Union regulators'
                    methodology for choosing each company's fees. "Currently,
                    companies that record a loss don't have to pay, even if they
                    have a large user base or represent a greater regulatory
                    burden, which means some companies pay nothing, leaving
                    others to pay a disproportionate amount of the total," a
                    Meta spokesperson remarked. Failure to comply with the fee
                    could lead to a fine of up to six percent of a company's
                    global revenue.

                    The UK’s 40-year-old fusion reactor achieved a world record

                    [...] JET forged together atoms of deuterium and tritium –
                    two stable isotopes of hydrogen – in plasma to create
                    helium, while also releasing a vast amount of energy. This
                    is the same reaction that powers our sun. It was a type of
                    fusion reactor known as a tokamak, which contains plasma in
                    a donut shape using rings of electromagnets.

                    Scientists ran the last experiments with deuterium-tritium
                    fuel at JET in October last year and other experiments
                    continued until December. But the machine has now been shut
                    down for good and it is being decommissioned over the next
                    16 years.

                    “It’s great that it’s gone out with a little flourish,” says
                    Matthews. “It’s got a noble history. It’s served its time
                    and they’re going to squeeze a bit more information out of
                    it during its decommissioning period as well. So it’s not
                    something to be sad about; it’s something to be celebrated.”

                    Feeding, fighting, fleeing and sex — in 1958, the
                    neuropsychologist Karl H. Pribram identified these as the
                    four basic drives that underpin human behavior, influencing
                    everything we do. There are thousands of apps, websites and
                    devices for food, arguing and transportation, and maybe even
                    more for sex.

                    technology has become so entwined with human desire that

                    With some recent interest in undocumented opcodes and
                    microcode on modern Intel chips, I decided to do a proper
                    writeup on what I found out while researching and playing
                    around with the venerable 80286 ("Beige Unlock"?).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The documentation for the '286s LOADALL instruction - which
                    Intel only made available under NDA back in the day -
                    briefly mentions how it is used during automated testing of
                    every produced chip (and is thus guaranteed to work). But
                    its other purpose was kept secret: to support In-Circuit
                    Emulation (ICE).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An ICE is a very expensive device that plugs into the CPU
                    socket and "emulates" the chip while providing debugging
                    functionality. This is not at all like the kind of software
                    emulation familiar today, or even using a modern
                    microcontroller to emulate 30+ year old hardware: it needs
                    to run at the same speed and interact with external hardware
                    in exactly the same way as the chip it replaces, using
                    technology available at the time when the 286 was still in
                    production.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not-so-shockingly, the way they did it was to use an actual
                    286 chip to "emulate" itself, with some extra pins to allow
                    the debugging hardware to monitor it and take control. This
                    debug interface uses the 5 pins left unused on the 286
                    package. The only public description of these comes from a
                    patent.

                    ...<br />For their study, the researchers drew on thousands
                    of records from 1891 to 2021 to build a database of native
                    and alien earthworms, then combined it with a second
                    database documenting U.S. border interceptions of alien
                    earthworms between 1945 and 1975. With the aid of machine
                    learning, the team used the combined databases to
                    reconstruct assumed introduction pathways and spread of
                    alien earthworm species.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found alien earthworm species in 97% of studied soils
                    across North America, with alien occupation higher in the
                    northern part of the continent and lower in the south and
                    west. Overall, aliens represent 23% of the continent's 308
                    earthworm species, and account for 12 of the 13 most
                    widespread earthworm species. By comparison, in the U.S.
                    only 8% of fish species, 6% of mammal species, and 2% of
                    insects and arachnids are alien.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Canada, the proportion of alien earthworms is three times
                    greater than that of native earthworms. Across most of the
                    lower 48 U.S. states and Mexico, there is about one alien
                    earthworm for every two native species.

                    AMD's Epyc server CPU business was the best-performing
                    category, taking a 31.1% revenue share (23.1% unit share).
                    That represents a year-on-year revenue share increase of 4%.
                    YoY unit share increased even more, up 5.5%, though this
                    figure actually decreased 0.2% Quarter-over-Quarter, which
                    AMD put down to Intel server processors "being sold into
                    non-data center applications and higher Atom shipments."

                    AMD saw its consumer processors' revenue share increase YoY
                    during Q4, too, with desktops up 1.3% and notebooks up 2.5%.
                    The company's unit share also increased in this category,
                    especially mobile CPUs, which were up 3.9% YoY. Total client
                    revenue share was up 2% YoY to 15.4% but down 1.6% QoQ.

                    It's a long way to the nearest star, which means
                    conventional rockets won't get us there. The fuel
                    requirements would make our ship prohibitively heavy. So an
                    alternative is to travel light. Literally. Rather than
                    carrying your fuel with you, simply attach your tiny
                    starship to a large reflective sail, and shine a powerful
                    laser at it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The impulse of photons would push the starship to a fraction
                    of light speed. Riding a beam of light, a lightsail mission
                    could reach Proxima Centauri in a couple of decades. But
                    while the idea is simple, the engineering challenges are
                    significant, because, across decades and light-years, even
                    the smallest problem can be difficult to solve.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One example of this can be seen in a recent arXiv preprint
                    paper. It looks at the problem of how to balance a lightsail
                    on a laser beam. Although the laser could be aimed directly
                    toward a star, or where it will be in a couple of decades,
                    the lightsail would only follow the beam if it is perfectly
                    balanced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If a sail is slightly tilted relative to the beam, the
                    reflected laser light would give the lightsail a slight
                    transverse push. No matter how small this deviation is, it
                    would grow over time, causing its path to drift ever away
                    from its target. We will never align a lightsail perfectly,
                    so we need some way to correct small deviations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For traditional rockets, this can be done with internal
                    gyroscopes to stabilize the rocket, and engines that can
                    dynamically adjust their thrust to restore balance. But a
                    gyro system would be too heavy for an interstellar
                    lightsail, and adjustments of the beam would take months or
                    years to reach the lightsail, making quick changes
                    impossible. So the authors suggest using a radiative trick
                    known as the Poynting–Robertson effect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The effect was first studied in the early 1900s and is
                    caused by the relative motion between an object and a light
                    source. For example, a dust grain orbiting the sun sees
                    light coming at a slight forward angle due to its motion
                    through sunlight. That little forward component of light can
                    slow down the asteroid ever so slightly. This effect causes
                    dust to drift toward the inner solar system over time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this paper, the authors consider a two-dimensional model
                    to see how the Poynting–Robertson effect might be used to
                    keep our lightsail probe on course. To keep things simple,
                    they assumed the light beam to be a simple monochromatic
                    plane wave. Real lasers are more complex, but the assumption
                    is reasonable for a proof of concept. They then showed how a
                    simple two-sail system can use the effects of relative
                    motion to keep the craft in balance. As the sails tilt off
                    course slightly, a restorative force from the beam counters
                    it. Thus proving the concept could work.

                    Many Indigenous peoples and local communities around the
                    world are leading very satisfying lives despite having very
                    little money.This is the conclusion of a study by ICTA-UAB,
                    which shows that many societies with very low monetary
                    income have remarkably high levels of life satisfaction,
                    comparable to those in wealthy countries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Economic growth is often prescribed as a sure way of
                    increasing the well-being of people in low-income countries,
                    and global surveys in recent decades have supported this
                    strategy by showing that people in high-income countries
                    tend to report higher levels of life satisfaction than those
                    in low-income countries. This strong correlation might
                    suggest that only in rich societies can people be happy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The research, published in the scientific journal
                    <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2311703121"
                      >Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a
                    >
                    (PNAS), consisted of a survey of 2,966 people from
                    Indigenous and local communities in 19 globally distributed
                    sites. Only 64% of surveyed households had any cash income.
                    The results show that "surprisingly, many populations with
                    very low monetary incomes report very high average levels of
                    life satisfaction, with scores similar to those in wealthy
                    countries," says Eric Galbraith, researcher at ICTA-UAB and
                    McGill University and lead author of the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers highlight that, although they now know
                    that people in many Indigenous and local communities report
                    high levels of life satisfaction, they do not know why.
                    Prior work would suggest that family and social support and
                    relationships, spirituality, and connections to nature are
                    among the important factors on which this happiness is
                    based, "but it is possible that the important factors differ
                    significantly between societies or, conversely, that a small
                    subset of factors dominate everywhere. I would hope that, by
                    learning more about what makes life satisfying in these
                    diverse communities, it might help many others to lead more
                    satisfying lives while addressing the sustainability
                    crisis," Galbraith concludes.

                    consumer welfare, and toward nickel-and-diming customers in

                    Part of that process involves eliminating popular things
                    that previously helped bring in new customers, like password
                    sharing. We’ve noted how when Netflix wanted to sign up more

                    bottom line, and basically acted as free advertising.
                    Besides, Netflix already charges users extra for

                  <p>
                    Now that global growth is slowing, Netflix has to
                    effectively cannibalize its own product quality and brand to
                    appease Wall Street. It’s not good enough to just have a
                    high quality product that makes money and people like; the
                    need for improved quarterly returns inevitably turns
                    disruptors into turf protectors. It’s what kicked Comcast in

                    of additional profits from existing customers, these
                    executives will do it. Wall Street demands it. And when
                    annoyed users increasingly head to free alternatives or
                    piracy after being inundated with price hikes and sagging
                    product quality, execs will inevitably blame everything and
                    everyone but themselves for the failure. It’s how this all

                    We're very familiar with the many projects in which
                    Raspberry Pi hardware is used, from giving old computers a
                    new lease of life through to running the animated displays
                    so beloved by retailers. But cracking BitLocker? We doubt
                    the company will be bragging too much about that particular
                    application.

                    over the weekend, which demonstrated how a Raspberry Pi Pico
                    can be used to gain access to a BitLocker-secured device in

                    the two will be combined, in which case the technique shown

                    software."

                  <p>
                    At less than a minute in the example, we'd dispute the
                    "plenty of time" claim, and while the Raspberry Pi Pico is
                    undoubtedly impressive for the price, at less than $10, the
                    hardware spend is neither expensive nor specific.

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    About three months ago, I bought a flip phone and turned off
                    my smartphone for good. [...] [A student] asks, "Why did you
                    put yourself on punishment?" But I do not feel punished. I
                    feel free.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kids and their phones are different - closer - since COVID.
                    [...] Teachers said they could sense kids' phones
                    distracting them from inside their pockets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We banned phones outright, equipping classrooms with
                    lockboxes that the kids call "cellphone prisons." It's not
                    perfect, but it's better. A teacher said, "It's like we have
                    the children back." [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And what about adults? Ninety-five percent of young adults
                    now keep their phones nearby every waking hour, according to
                    a Gallup survey; [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We want children off their phones because we want them to be
                    present, but children need our presence, too. [...] Every
                    year, I see kids get phones and disappear into them. I don't
                    want that to happen to mine. I don't want that to have
                    happened to me.
                  </p>
                  <p>So I quit. And now I have this flip phone.</p>
                  <p>
                    What I don't have is Facetime or Instagram. I can't use
                    Grubhub or Lyft or the Starbucks Mobile App. I don't even
                    have a browser. I drove to a student's quinceañera, and I
                    had to print out directions as if it were 2002.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I can still make calls, though people are startled to
                    get one. I can still text. And I can still see your
                    pictures, though I can "heart" them only in my heart. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Turning off my smartphone didn't fix all my problems. But I
                    do notice my brain moving more deliberately, shifting less
                    abruptly between moods. I am bored more, sure - the days
                    feel longer - but I am deciding that's a good thing. And I
                    am still connected to the people I love; they just can't
                    text me TikToks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's hard to imagine a revolution against the smartphone,
                    though there are glimmers of resistance. [...] Twelve
                    percent of adults recently told Gallup that their
                    smartphones make life worse, up from 6% in 2015.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But I'm not doing this to change the culture. I'm doing this
                    because I don't want my sons to remember me lost in my
                    phone.

                    This is compounded in difficulty by the degree of
                    customization involved in buying a Vision Pro. It requires
                    two scans from an iPhone or iPad with Apple's Face ID. These
                    measurements decide which size straps should come in the
                    box, as well as which size light shield will fit your face.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some sellers list the size they bought (presumably,
                    revealing the size of their noggin in the process); in other
                    cases, you may go in blind on the sizing. As long as there's
                    stock in an Apple Store near you, it makes far more sense,
                    for $3,499.99, to go get it fitted to your own head. The
                    idea that someone would want to buy an ill-fitting Vision
                    Pro for more money doesn't make much sense, especially
                    because they might end up going to Apple anyway and shelling
                    out $199 for a new light seal and cushions or $99 for a new
                    headband.

                    He also used a script to ping all of the IPv4 addresses in
                    order to gauge how many were "alive" within the AWS network
                    and came up with an answer of about 6 million. But many
                    instances on AWS will have a security policy to not respond
                    to a ping packet, so the actual number of active IPv4
                    addresses could be double that.

                  <p>
                    Even with just those six million addresses, that's $262.8
                    million AWS will earn from charging for IPv4 in a year.

                    He forecast the headline $400 million to $1 billion figure
                    by projecting a "conservative" estimate that between 10
                    percent and 30 percent of the IPv4 addresses (approximately
                    7.9 million) published in the

                    We asked AWS if it recognized any of these figures, and what
                    the company itself estimated it would earn from charging
                    customers for public IPv4 addresses, but it declined to
                    answer, instead referring us to its original blog post
                    disclosing the charges.

                    The general feeling among industry experts is that this is
                    fair game, and customers should make plans to migrate to
                    IPv6 if they don't like it – assuming their applications
                    allow this, of course.

                  <p>
                    [...] "My view is that AWS has been smart in buying up IPv4
                    addresses, and this is a way for it to cash in until IPv6
                    adoption makes IPv4 redundant. It's just that organizations
                    are not rushing to move to IPv6," he said.

                Everyone knows we should be doing backups. While the standard
                these days is an online backup (too expensive for a full backup,
                I use it for important, small things,) or using an external hard
                drive, SSDs can lose their data after a few years of not being
                powered on and hard drives are complicated mechanical beasts
                susceptible to their grease hardening, bearings seizing, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                The best option if I want long term backups is to grab good
                quality blurays and a burner. Is anyone else out there doing
                this? How are you handling splitting up your data (who only has
                32gb of data these days?) Do you just have a dedicated spot on
                your hard drive to stage backups before burning or are there
                some software tricks on modern computers like the old days to
                burn a single "file" across multiple discs? How far back a
                backup have you recovered, now that bluray's going on 20 years
                old?

                    In the new study, the researchers experimented with
                    superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors. In each
                    device, a 40-nanometer-wide niobium titanium nitride wire
                    was cooled to about 2 kelvins (about –271 °C), rendering the
                    wire superconductive. A single photon could disrupt this
                    fragile state, generating electrical pulses that enabled the
                    efficient detection of individual photons.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The scientists contorted the nanowire in each device into a
                    fractal pattern that took on similar shapes at various
                    magnifications. This let the sensor detect photons of all
                    polarizations, boosting its efficiency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new detector was up to nearly three times as efficient
                    as other single-photon detectors at sensing near- and
                    mid-infrared light. This let the researchers perform
                    non-line-of-sight imaging, achieving a spatial resolution of
                    roughly 1.3 to 1.5 centimeters.

                    started the challenge that there was less than a 30 percent
                    chance of success within the year, since, at the time, no
                    one had been able to read actual letters inside of a scroll.
                    However, the crowdsourcing approach proved wildly
                    successful. It's still just 5 percent of a single scroll, so
                    Friedman, Searles, and Gross have announced a new challenge
                    for 2024: $100,000 for the first entry that can read 90
                    percent of the four scrolls scanned thus far.

                    Researchers have discovered a non-opioid compound that, in
                    mice, effectively reduced the pain hypersensitivity
                    associated with chronic and often debilitating nerve pain
                    caused by diabetes or chemotherapy drugs. It's opened the
                    door to developing a drug to treat the condition for which
                    existing painkillers do little.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Diabetes, chemotherapy drugs, multiple sclerosis, injuries
                    and amputations have all been associated with neuropathic
                    pain, usually caused by damage to nerves in various body
                    tissues, including the skin, muscles and joints. Mechanical
                    hypersensitivity – or mechanical allodynia – is a major
                    symptom of neuropathic pain, where innocuous stimuli like
                    light touch cause severe pain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many available pain medications aren't effective in reducing
                    this often-debilitating type of chronic pain. However,
                    researchers at the University of Texas at Austin (UT
                    Austin), in collaboration with UT Dallas and the University
                    of Miami, may have advanced the treatment of neuropathic
                    pain by discovering a molecule that reduces mechanical
                    hypersensitivity in mice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We found it to be an effective painkiller, and the effects
                    were rather long-lived," said Stephen Martin, a
                    co-corresponding author of the study. "When we tested it on
                    different models, diabetic neuropathy and
                    chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, for example, we found this
                    compound has an incredible beneficial effect."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "It's our goal to make this compound into a drug that
                    can be used to treat chronic pain without the dangers of
                    opioids," Martin said. "Neuropathic pain is often a
                    debilitating condition that can affect people their entire
                    lives, and we need a treatment that is well tolerated and
                    effective."

                    The European Parliament has reached a provisional deal on EU
                    regulations to strengthen consumers' right to repair.

                    >
                    - the rules were first proposed in March 2022, and the hope
                    is that new requirements will be finalized in 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The thinking is that consumers should be better informed
                    about the lifespan and repairability of products before
                    buying them, and there should be measures to boost repair
                    after the legal guarantee period has expired.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All told, the bill looks set to bolster the repair sector.
                    Manufacturers must make spare parts and tools available for
                    "a reasonable price" and be prohibited from using
                    contractual clauses or hardware or software blocks to
                    obstruct repairs. While singling no company out
                    specifically, the European Parliament said: "In particular,
                    they should not impede the use of second-hand or 3D issued
                    spare parts by independent repairers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other consumer rights in the deal include options for
                    borrowing a device while their own is being repaired or
                    opting for a refurbished unit, an additional one-year
                    extension of the legal guarantee for repaired goods, and
                    free online access to indicative repair prices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under the regulation, manufacturers must inform customers of
                    the duty to repair and be obligated to fix "common household
                    products," such as a washing machine or smartphone. The
                    European Parliament has left open the possibility of adding
                    more items over time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It will be a while before this all goes into effect,
                    though. Once both Council and Parliament adopt the
                    directive, member states will have 24 months to get it into
                    national law.

                        had failed quality control were being resold and

                        capacity and the manufacturer's logo removed from the
                        chip. Clearly discarded and unrecognizable microSD cards
                        are also soldered onto a USB stick and managed with the

                        these NAND chips, but not in a good way. The chips
                        originally used single-level cell (SLC) memory cells
                        that only stored one bit each, offering less data
                        density but better performance and reliability. In order
                        to increase the amount of storage the chips offered,

                    its products to disrupt Earth's climate on a scale
                    significant to human civilization," said Geoffrey Supran, an

                    extraordinarily early on that fossil fuel combustion was
                    profound on a planetary scale," he said.

                    risks of their product for 70 years. Trusting them to be
                    part of the solutions is foolhardy. We've now moved into an

                    Microsoft opened its arms to Linux during the Windows 10
                    era, inventing an entire virtualized subsystem to allow
                    users and developers to access a real-deal Linux command
                    line without leaving the Windows environment. Now, it looks
                    like Microsoft may embrace yet another Linux feature: the
                    sudo command.

                    sudo is most commonly used at the command line when the user
                    needs administrator access to the system—usually to install
                    or update software, or to make changes to system files.
                    Users who aren't in the sudo user group on a given system
                    can't run the command, protecting the rest of the files on
                    the system from being accessed or changed.

                    with the setting in a build of Windows Server 2025, which
                    currently requires Developer Mode to be enabled in the
                    Settings app. There's a toggle to turn the sudo command on
                    and off and a separate drop-down to tweak how the command
                    behaves when you use it, though as of this writing the
                    command itself doesn't actually work yet.

                  <p>
                    The sudo command is also part of the Windows Subsystem for
                    Linux (WSL), but that version of the sudo command only
                    covers Linux software. This one seems likely to run native
                    Windows commands, though obviously we won't know exactly how
                    it works before it's enabled and fully functional.
                    Currently, users who want a sudo-like command in Windows
                    need to rely on
                    <a href="https://github.com/gerardog/gsudo"
                      >third-party software like gsudo</a
                    >
                    to accomplish the task.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The benefit of the sudo command for Windows users—whether
                    they're using Windows Server or otherwise—would be the
                    ability to elevate the privilege level without having to
                    open an entirely separate command prompt or Windows Terminal
                    window. According to the options available in the preview
                    build, commands run with sudo could be opened up in a new
                    window automatically, or they could happen inline, but you'd
                    never need to do the "right-click, run-as-administrator"
                    dance again if you didn't want to.

                    stories—part of a journalistic outreach that comes as the

                    [...] The partnerships come as media companies have become
                    increasingly concerned over generative AI and its potential
                    threat to their businesses. News publishers are grappling
                    with how to use AI to improve their work and stay ahead of
                    technology, while also fearing that they could lose traffic,
                    and therefore revenue, to AI chatbots—which can churn out
                    humanlike text and information in seconds.

                  <p>
                    The New York Times in December filed a lawsuit against
                    Microsoft and OpenAI, alleging the tech companies have taken
                    a "free ride" on millions of its articles to build their
                    artificial intelligence chatbots, and seeking billions of
                    dollars in damages.

                  <p>
                    [...] Semafor, which is free to read, is funded by wealthy
                    individuals, including 3G capital founder Jorge Paulo Lemann
                    and KKR co-founder Henry Kravis. The company made more than
                    $10 million in revenue in 2023 and has more than 500,000
                    subscriptions to its free newsletters. Justin Smith said
                    Semafor was "very close to a profit" in the fourth quarter
                    of 2023.
