                    The federal government is working to speed things along with
                    an injection of cash through Project NextGen, a $5 billion
                    effort to usher new and improved covid vaccines to market.
                    In October, the Department of Health and Human Services
                    <a
                      href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/10/13/project-nextgen-selects-initial-vaccine-candidates-awards-over-500-million-advance-development-vaccines-therapeutics.html"
                      >announced that nearly $20 million would go to two
                      companies</a
                    >
                    developing mucosal vaccines—Codagenix and CastleVax. That
                    money will help the companies gear up for studies to test
                    how well their vaccines work to prevent symptomatic
                    infections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Codagenix's candidate, a nasal vaccine called CoviLiv, is
                    already part of a phase 3 global efficacy trial coordinated
                    by the World Health Organization. And in October, the
                    company reported results from a safety study in adults in
                    the UK who had never been vaccinated for covid before. The
                    nasal mist prompted robust immunity, at least as measured by
                    markers in the blood. But evidence of an immune response in
                    the blood doesn't necessarily indicate an immune response in
                    the mucosal lining of the airways. Or,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)01427-7/fulltext"
                      >as one physician puts it</a
                    >, "just like the 'far, dark side of the Moon', which is
                    invisible from the earth, the mucosal response to pathogens
                    is a far, dark side of immunity that is poorly or not
                    visible from the peripheral blood and more complicated to
                    probe than systemic immunity."
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                    TBD. Different groups are trying a variety of strategies.
                    The goal is to induce immunity in the airways that is
                    robust, broad, and durable. But which strategy will succeed
                    is a bit of a question mark at the moment. Mucosal vaccines
                    fall into a few categories depending on how they're
                    administered and the platform they use. Some are sprays that
                    are squirted into the nose (CovLiv, for example). Others are
                    meant to be inhaled into the lungs (such as one developed by
                    CanSinBIO in China).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes these two routes of administration get lumped
                    together, but they actually are very different, says
                    Mangalakumari Jeyanathan, a researcher at McMaster
                    University and coauthor of
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03557-7"
                      >an editorial</a
                    >
                    that accompanies the new inhalable-vaccine paper. With a
                    nasal vaccine, the contents go into the nasal cavity. But
                    Jeyanathan thinks inhaled vaccines, which go deep into the
                    lungs, are likely to work better. Her team's research
                    suggests that nasal vaccines induce immune responses only in
                    the upper respiratory tract, not in the lower respiratory
                    tract. That means, she says, that if the vaccine doesn't
                    prevent infection, the lungs are still vulnerable, and "we
                    really need the immune responses to prevent any sort of
                    serious damage to the lung."

                    that anyone can share, adapt, or remix that material. You

                    playbook and create “Steamboat Willie: the Climate Change
                    Edition,” in which Mickey’s boat is grounded in a dry
                    riverbed. You could create a feminist remake with Minnie
                    Mouse as the central figure. You could reimagine Mickey and
                    Minnie dedicating themselves to animal welfare. (The animals
                    in <em>Steamboat Willie </em>are contorted rather
                    uncomfortably into musical instruments. PETA would not
                    approve.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can do all of this and more, <em>so long as </em>you
                    steer clear of the subsisting rights indicated by the orange
                    circles, namely:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Use the original versions of Mickey and Minnie Mouse
                        from 1928, without copyrightable elements of later
                        iterations (though not every later iteration will be
                        copyrightable, as I explain below) and
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Do not confuse consumers into thinking that your
                        creation is produced or sponsored by Disney as a matter
                        of trademark law. One way to help ensure that your
                        audience is not confused is to make the actual source of
                        the work – you or your company – clear on the title
                        screen or cover, along with a prominent disclaimer
                        indicating that your work was not produced, endorsed,
                        licensed, or approved by Disney.
                      </p>

                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    So, is January 1, 2024 doomsday for Disney? No. Disney still
                    retains copyright over newer iterations of Mickey such as
                    the “Sorcerer’s Apprentice” Mickey from
                    <em>Fantasia</em> (1940) as well as trademarks over Mickey
                    as a brand identifier. People will still go to its theme
                    parks, pay to see its movies, buy its merchandise. Its brand
                    identity will remain intact.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In sum, yes, you can use Mickey in new creative works. There
                    are some more complex peripheral legal issues, but here is
                    your guide through them.

                    is set to appeal before the year is out. Unless that
                    judgment is overturned or new laws are passed, libraries
                    have no alternative but to license digital books that are
                    likely to be riddled with spyware.

                    in 1080p with medium graphics settings, and it can handle

                    potential for NPUs to make our computing lives slightly
                    easier. They could help eke out more battery life while
                    editing audio in Audacity on the go, or give you a slightly
                    sleeker background blur during Zoom calls.

                    To test this, the researchers explored whether introgressed
                    genetic variants—variants that moved from Neanderthals into
                    modern humans—have associations with the preferences of the
                    body for wakefulness and sleep in large cohort of several
                    hundred thousand people from the UK Biobank.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found many introgressed variants with effects on sleep
                    preference, and most strikingly, they found that these
                    variants consistently increase "morningness," the propensity
                    to wake up early. This suggests a directional effect on the
                    trait and is consistent with adaptations to high latitude
                    observed in other animals.

                    v. Amato. The brief provided case numbers, summaries, and
                    ruling dates, but Furman concluded that the cases are fake.

                    sanctioned pursuant to (1) Rule 11(b)(2) &amp; (c) of the
                    Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, (2) 28 U.S.C. § 1927, and

                    Assuming he can't turn up those cases, Schwartz must also
                    provide "a thorough explanation of how the motion came to

                    a page in the middle of a Fourth Circuit decision that has
                    nothing to do with supervised release." A second

                    The key to a nation's long-run prosperity is increased
                    productivity. If workers can produce more in an hour, day,
                    or week then they can collectively work less or enjoy more
                    of the fruits of their labor: More pickleball courts and
                    more time to play pickleball.

                    With all the astonishing improvements that we see on our
                    computers and smartphones, it might seem that productivity
                    is about to explode, that our concern will soon be how to
                    distribute income and manage leisure when machines do all
                    the work that people used to do. The reality is the
                    opposite. The annual rate of increase of productivity in the
                    United States averaged nearly 3% between 1870 and 1970 but
                    has since slowed to less than 1%, according to data from the
                    Bureau of Labor Statistics. That 2-percentage-point drop
                    isn't much in the short run, but it is everything in the
                    long run. If productivity continues to increase at 1% annual
                    rate instead of 3%, workers will produce a third less output
                    in 20 years, 50% less in 35 years.

                    On Wednesday, news quickly spread on social media about a
                    new enabled-by-default Dropbox setting that shares Dropbox
                    data with OpenAI for an experimental AI-powered search
                    feature, but Dropbox says data is only shared if the feature
                    is actively being used. Dropbox says that user data shared
                    with third-party AI partners isn't used to train AI models
                    and is deleted within 30 days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even with assurances of data privacy laid out by Dropbox on
                    an

                      >AI privacy FAQ page</a
                    >, the discovery that the setting had been enabled by
                    default upset some Dropbox users. The setting was first
                    noticed by writer
                    <a
                      href="https://bsky.app/profile/authorwinifred.bsky.social/post/3kgemufi2yj2o"

                  <p>
                    [...] In a statement to Ars Technica, a Dropbox
                    representative said, "The third-party AI toggle is only
                    turned on to give all eligible customers the opportunity to
                    view our new AI features and functionality, like Dropbox AI.
                    It does not enable customers to use these features without
                    notice. Any features that use third-party AI offer
                    disclosure of third-party use, and link to settings that
                    they can manage. Only after a customer sees the third-party
                    AI transparency banner and chooses to proceed with asking a
                    question about a file, will that file be sent to a
                    third-party to generate answers. Our customers are still in
                    control of when and how they use these features."

                    in 1982 — Arjen Lenstra, Hendrik Lenstra Jr. and László
                    Lovász. LLL, along with its many descendants, can break
                    cryptographic schemes in some cases; studying how they
                    behave helps researchers design systems that are less
                    vulnerable to attack. And the algorithm's talents stretch
                    beyond cryptography: It's also a useful tool in advanced
                    mathematical arenas such as computational number theory.

                  <p>
                    Over the years, researchers have honed variants of LLL to
                    make the approach more practical — but only up to a point.
                    Now, a pair of cryptographers have built a new LLL-style
                    algorithm with a significant boost in efficiency. The new
                    technique, which won the

                    pose a threat to such systems, since taking them down
                    requires finding shorter vectors than these algorithms can
                    achieve. But the best attacks researchers know of use an
                    LLL-style algorithm as a "basic building block," said

                    researchers may be able to expand the range of experiments

                    on its platform, will begin publishing a “comprehensive deep

                    100 billion hours viewed, Netflix said. The Night Agent, a

                    Scientists fed fruit flies a diet to make them extra plump.
                    In their old age, the researchers put them on a diet and
                    found remarkable results. If the findings transfer to
                    humans, it might mean we can improve our health at any age
                    by cutting calories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While fruit flies might not seem like the closest human
                    relatives, the diminutive insects actually share about 75%
                    of our DNA, so they are frequently used in scientific
                    studies. They also share a fair amount of the same metabolic
                    pathways as humans, so studies relating to diet can be
                    particularly useful for findings that might apply to human
                    health.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For this go around, researchers at the University of
                    Connecticut School of Medicine put a batch of male fruit
                    flies on a high calorie diet to cause them to become obese.
                    They also restricted the calorie intake of a different group
                    of flies. The calorie-restricted flies were able to live to
                    a maximum of 120 days, which is relatively old for the
                    flies. The fat flies on the high-calorie diet only lived, on
                    average, less than 80 days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But what really surprised the researchers is that switching
                    diets, even later in life, was able to extend the flies'
                    lifespans. When young flies were switched from a
                    high-calorie to a low-calorie diet at 20 days, they lived
                    almost as long as the flies that had spent their whole lives
                    eating less. Even more notably, when the fat flies were
                    switched to a low-calorie diet at 50 or 60 days – a point at
                    which most of their plump cohorts had already died – the
                    researchers saw extended lifespans and improved metabolisms.

                    Google is about to launch its grand plan to block
                    third-party cookies in Chrome that many websites use to
                    track your activity across the web for profit.

                  <p>
                    Starting on January 4th, Google will start testing its new
                    Tracking Protection feature that will eventually restrict
                    website access to third-party cookies by default. It will
                    come to a very small subset of Chrome users at the start,
                    specifically to one percent of users globally. Afterward,
                    Google plans to phase out the use of third-party cookies for
                    all users in the second half of 2024.

                    [...] Google’s approach to cookie-free advertising sounds
                    helpful to both privacy-focused users and the overall
                    advertiser business in comparison to other web browsers that
                    take more stone-walled approaches to block cross-site
                    tracking. However, Google’s competitors and privacy

                    the company an unfair advantage in selling its own ads. With
                    that in mind, Google says it’s hedging that H2 2024 target
                    for turning the feature on globally in case it needs time to
                    address “any remaining competition concerns.”

                    NASA's veteran Voyager 1 spacecraft has stopped transmitting
                    engineering and science data back to Earth.

                    appears to be with the Flight Data System (FDS), which is
                    not communicating correctly with one of the probe's
                    subsystems - the Telemetry Modulation Unit (TMU).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rather than useful data, the TMU is simply transmitting a
                    repeating pattern of ones and zeroes as if it were "stuck,"
                    according to NASA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The FDS is responsible for collecting data from Voyager 1's
                    science instruments as well as on the general health of the
                    spacecraft. This is all packaged up and sent back to Earth
                    by the TMU. Having worked through the possibilities, the
                    Voyager team reckons the issue lies with the FDS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This past weekend the team tried to restart the FDS and
                    return it to the state it was in before the issue began, but
                    the spacecraft still isn't returning useable [<i>sic</i>]
                    data," NASA says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Engineers face multiple challenges. First, the Voyagers are
                    famously old – dealing with their quirks involves poring
                    through decades-old documents. Commands sent to the probes
                    must be meticulously verified to prevent unintended
                    consequences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And then there is the sheer amount of time it takes to
                    communicate with the Voyagers. A command from mission
                    control on Earth will take more than 22 hours to reach
                    Voyager 1. It can, therefore, take 45 hours to determine
                    whether a given instruction worked as expected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA reckons it will be several weeks of work for engineers
                    to devise a new plan to deal with the problem.
                  </p>

                    that resulted in garbled data on the probe's attitude being
                    sent back to Earth. That issue was resolved by switching to
                    a different computer. However, in that instance, Voyager 1
                    continued returning science data. The latest problem has
                    stopped that.

                    The next time you find yourself having to diagnose and fix a
                    problem remotely, remember that it could always be worse,
                    even if sometimes it feels as though that misbehaving server
                    is also 15 billion(*) miles away.

                Given the limit imposed by the speed of light, a signal sent to

                    Marcan confirmed his YouTube downgrade on Arm hunch by
                    changing the browser user agent (UA) and doing some A/B

                    The 2nd Circuit panel ruling dismissed Musk's argument that
                    the settlement is a "prior restraint" on his speech, writing
                    that "Parties entering into consent decrees may voluntarily
                    waive their First Amendment and other rights." The judges
                    also saw "no evidence to support Musk's contention that the
                    SEC has used the consent decree to conduct bad-faith,
                    harassing investigations of his protected speech."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is no guarantee that the Supreme Court will take up
                    Musk's case. Musk's petition says the case presents the
                    constitutional question of whether "a party's acceptance of
                    a benefit prevents that party from contending that the
                    government violated the unconstitutional conditions doctrine
                    in requiring a waiver of constitutional rights in exchange
                    for that benefit."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Musk argues that his settlement violates the
                    unconstitutional conditions doctrine, which "limits the
                    government's ability to condition benefits on the
                    relinquishment of constitutional rights." He says his case
                    also presents the question of "whether the government can
                    insulate its demands that settling defendants waive
                    constitutional rights from judicial scrutiny."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This petition presents an apt opportunity for the Court to
                    clarify that government settlements are not immune from
                    constitutional scrutiny, to the immediate benefit of the
                    hundreds of defendants who settle cases with the SEC each
                    year," Musk's petition said.

                    One day he heard from colleagues about a vocational
                    schoolteacher berating a crying student at the plant.
                    Assembly-line managers didn't discipline the students
                    directly, instead complaining to the teachers. This
                    instructor had been yelling and pulling the boy by the ear.
                    Tang thought of his own young son, about to start primary
                    school. What if his teachers treated him like that? I
                    wouldn't accept it. I couldn't accept it, Tang thought. In
                    the spring of 2019, assuming he understood the possible
                    consequences, he decided to speak out.

                      caused such great harm to me and my family! After I was

                    Few people have seen their handiwork influence the world
                    more than Bill Mensch. He helped create the legendary 8-bit
                    6502 microprocessor, launched in 1975, which was the heart
                    of groundbreaking systems including the Atari 2600,Apple II,
                    and Commodore 64. Mensch also created the VIA 65C22
                    input/output chip—noted for its rich features and which was
                    crucial to the 6502's overall popularity—and the
                    second-generation 65C816, a 16-bit processor that powered
                    machines such as the Apple IIGS, and theSuper Nintendo
                    console.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of the 65x series of chips are still in production. The
                    processors and their variants are used as microcontrollers
                    in commercial products, and they remain popular among
                    hobbyists who build home-brewed computers. The surge of
                    interest inretrocomputing has led to folks once again
                    swapping tips on how to write polished games using the 6502
                    assembly code, with new titles being released for the Atari,
                    BBC Micro, and other machines.

                    The Great Wall of China used to be much greater. What stands
                    today is only a fraction of the expansive fortifications
                    built on the country's northern borders starting more than
                    2000 years ago and then eroded by time. But many sections of
                    the remaining walls seem to be getting preservation help
                    from an unlikely source: thin layers of bacteria, moss,
                    lichen, and other organisms known as biocrusts, which grow
                    on the surface of soils.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A study published today in Science Advances finds that these
                    so-called "living skins"
                    <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk5892"
                      >have likely protected parts of the Great Wall</a
                    >
                    from wind, rain, and other corrosive forces. And with
                    advances in technology and research, scientists might
                    eventually propagate new biocrusts to spare the wall from
                    further degradation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The work is "innovative and creative," says Nichole Barger,
                    an ecologist at the Nature Conservancy who was not involved
                    in the new research. She notes it's not necessarily
                    surprising, however, given the growing recognition of the
                    protective effects of biocrusts: These webs of growth are
                    known to help stabilize dryland ecosystems and prevent soil
                    erosion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of the Great Wall's most well-known and visited
                    sections are made of stone or brick, but other parts were
                    built out of soil compacted by workers, often called rammed
                    earth. Over time, this material can break down as rain seeps
                    in, wind blows the soil away, salt crystals form inside, and
                    temperatures fluctuate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But this compacted soil, much like the natural soils
                    surrounding it, can also become home to biocrusts. These
                    layers of growth have been estimated to cover some 12% of
                    the planet's land surface, and are concentrated in regions
                    with drier climates, including northern China. They come in
                    a variety of forms, from thin networks of bacteria mere
                    millimeters thick to denser layers of moss and lichen up to
                    a few centimeters in height.<br />...<br />The researchers
                    suggest these properties and others linked to biocrusts
                    protect the Great Wall from degradation in a few ways,
                    including by reducing wind erosion, preventing water and
                    salt from seeping in, and increasing the overall stability
                    of the rammed earth. Perhaps unsurprisingly, thicker,
                    moss-dominated biocrusts were generally more protective than
                    thinner ones dominated by cyanobacteria.

                  <p>
                    The app did, however, send a text message from a device to
                    an Apple server, and the response was used to generate an
                    encryption key pair, one for Apple and one for your device.
                    A Beeper service kept itself connected to Apple's servers to
                    notify it and you about new messages.

                    were spoofed to look like they came from a Mac Mini running
                    OS X Mountain Lion, perhaps providing Apple a means of
                    pinpointing and block them.

                    planned to build additional secure messaging into Beeper
                    Mini, including Signal and WhatsApp messaging, and make it
                    the primary focus of its efforts. Its prior app Beeper,

                    While swimming pools are almost synonymous with California
                    today, in the 1970s, they were still relatively new to many
                    families. The widespread economic prosperity of post-World
                    War II America, combined with radical changes in urban
                    planning regulations, resulted in the construction of more
                    than 150,000 swimming pools in California during the 1960s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kidney-shaped pools were particularly trendy during this
                    period: up to 20,000 of these pools were installed per year
                    in the greater Los Angeles region, accompanying a housing
                    boom of single-family home construction. Soon, the new,
                    curved-walled swimming pools in the suburbs of LA accounted
                    for 60% of all pools in California.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the California drought took hold in the 1970s, many of
                    these kidney-shaped pools were empty, making them ideal
                    playgrounds for freestyle skateboarders in the LA area.
                    Skateboarding had been a hobby for teens since the 1950s and
                    1960s, but in the 1970s, the freestyle scene exploded in
                    popularity. Freestyle borrowed much of its style from
                    surfing, and California was the epicentre of US surf
                    culture.

                    [...] One of the first ways AMD optimized power efficiency
                    was by desegregating compute from I/O and memory and then
                    using the best available process tech for each. The thinking
                    is that certain elements scale better with process shrinks
                    than others. This is the reason AMD's Epyc 4 CPUs use a 6nm
                    process node for I/O and a 5nm node for the compute dies.

                    geographic locations that are more ideal to place these
                    datacenters," he said. "I think there's a whole new area of
                    innovation in advanced cooling, better thermal materials,
                    better heat removal systems."

                    And with these technologies, Papermaster expects AMD and
                    others will be able to push power targets even higher. "I
                    don't see that we're at max wattage by any means," he says.

                    However, beyond architectural, packaging and systems-level
                    improvements, Papermaster emphasizes the opportunity
                    presented by developing better software.

                    No matter who you are, feeling threatened in your identity
                    is bad for your well-being—and your career.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like many other essentials of life, our sense of self is
                    something we often take for granted, until it's under
                    threat. When our circumstances appear at odds with who we
                    feel ourselves to be, we are pitched headlong into a
                    distressing state that scholars call "identity threat",
                    which has been the subject of research from fields as
                    disparate as marketing and political science.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But this extensive body of literature—until now—has lacked
                    something truly fundamental: a rigorous way to measure
                    identity threat that distinguishes it from related
                    constructs such as self-esteem and identity suppression.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] At the same time, Vough stresses that no two
                    individuals have exactly the same relationship to their
                    identity. Conditions that might be threatening for one
                    member of an identity grouping might be taken in stride by
                    another. Moreover, not all identity groupings are equally
                    well-understood in their responses to threat, owing to gaps
                    in the research literature. Vough hopes her identity threat
                    scale will help scholars fill in those gaps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There's a fair amount of research about gender-related
                    threat, especially in the context of STEM, as well as race.
                    But we need more knowledge about threats based on age,
                    disability, etc. When we think of diversity, we think of
                    race and gender, but diversity is so much more than that,"
                    Vough says.

                    From the information contained in Bruno's comment, it
                    appears as though the work to correct the ground systems to
                    fuel Vulcan—the first stage propellant is methane, which
                    United Launch Alliance has not worked with before—will take
                    long enough that it will preclude another fueling test ahead
                    of the rocket's late December launch window. Thus, the next
                    launch attempt will likely occur no earlier than January 8.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It has been a slow year for United Launch Alliance, which
                    dominated the US launch industry a decade ago. The company
                    is going to launch just three rockets this calendar year:
                    the classified NROL-68 mission on a Delta IV Heavy rocket in
                    June, the "Silentbarker" mission for the National
                    Reconnaissance Office on an Atlas V in September, and two
                    Project Kuiper satellites for Amazon on an Atlas V in
                    October.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That is the company's lowest total number of launches since
                    its founding in 2006, when the rocket businesses of Lockheed
                    Martin and Boeing were merged.

                    "The appeal with the Higher Regional Court in Dresden
                    follows a decision by the Regional Court in Leipzig, in
                    which Sony prevailed, and Quad9 was convicted as a
                    wrongdoer. "
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From a practical perspective, Quad9 has removed the blocks
                    on all domains previously noted by Sony and documented in
                    the lower courts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ...the servers in question in this case were not located in
                    Germany, and the links they pointed to were on servers also
                    not in Germany.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sony Entertainment further asserted that we block the
                    domains globally, not just in Germany
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Quad9 has no office or standing in Germany (we are a Swiss
                    entity), but due to the Lugano Convention treaty it was
                    possible for Sony to serve an injunction in Switzerland and
                    drag Quad9 into legal proceedings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The court has also ruled that the case cannot be taken
                    to a higher court and their decision is the final word in
                    this particular case. Sony may appeal the appeal closure via
                    a complaint against the denial of leave of appeal and then
                    would have to appeal the case itself with the German Federal
                    Court. So while there is still a possibility that this case
                    could continue, Sony would have to win twice to turn the
                    decision around again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Quad9 have received a notice from a consortium of
                    Italian rightsholders (Sony Music Italy, Universal Music
                    Italy, Warner Music Italy, and Federation of Italian Music
                    Industry) who have demanded that Quad9 block domains in
                    Italy, and there is potentially another court process ahead
                    of us."

                    L4S stands for Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput,
                    and its goal is to make sure your packets spend as little
                    time needlessly waiting in line as possible by reducing the
                    need for queuing. To do this, it works on making the latency
                    feedback loop shorter; when congestion starts happening, L4S
                    means your devices find out about it almost immediately and
                    can start doing something to fix the problem. Usually, that
                    means backing off slightly on how much data they're sending.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As we covered before, our devices are constantly speeding
                    up, then slowing down, and repeating that cycle because the
                    amount of data that links in the network have to deal with
                    is constantly changing. But packets dropping isn't a great
                    signal, especially when buffers are part of the equation —
                    your device won't realize it's sending too much data until
                    it's sending <em>way</em> too much data, meaning it has to
                    clamp down hard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    L4S, however, gets rid of that lag between the problem
                    beginning and each device in the chain finding out about it.
                    That makes it easier to maintain a good amount of data
                    throughput without adding latency that increases the amount
                    of time it takes for data to be transferred.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    L4S lets the packets tell your device how well their journey
                    went
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For everyone else, I'll try to boil it down as much as I can
                    without glossing over too much. The L4S standard adds an
                    indicator to packets, which says whether they experienced
                    congestion on their journey from one device to another. If
                    they sail right on through, there's no problem, and nothing
                    happens. But if they have to wait in a queue for more than a
                    specified amount of time, they get marked as having
                    experienced congestion. That way, the devices can start
                    making adjustments immediately to keep the congestion from
                    getting worse and to potentially eliminate it altogether.
                    That keeps the data flowing as fast as it possibly can and
                    gets rid of the disruptions and mitigations that can add
                    latency with other systems.

                    Research also has shown that the retina selectively
                    accumulates lutein and zeaxanthin from the diet, forming
                    visible yellow macular pigment that enhances vision and
                    protects photoreceptors. By noninvasively measuring
                    patients' macular pigment optical density, researchers can
                    estimate the concentration of lutein and zeaxanthin in the
                    brain.

                    show exciting promise as an effective way to slow disease
                    progression," Dorey said. "I'd be thrilled if our data
                    motivated people to keep their brains in optimum condition
                    with a colorful diet with abundant carotenoids and regular
                    exercise. Available studies suggest this may also reduce
                    risk for dementia."

                    Investing.com, a Tel Aviv-based site owned by Joffre
                    Capital, is a financial news and information hub that
                    provides a mix of markets data and investing tips and
                    trends. But increasingly, the site has been relying on AI to
                    create its stories, which often appear to be thinly-veiled
                    copies of human-written stories written elsewhere.

                    [...] Pere Monguió, the head of content at FXStreet, told
                    Semafor in an email that he and his team noticed several
                    months ago that Investing was publishing stories similar to
                    their site's articles. FXStreet's 60-person team monitors
                    and quickly analyzes developments in global currencies. By
                    pumping out AI articles, Investing was eroding FXStreet's
                    edge, Monguió said.

                    Fool, said in an email. "We have seen, and acted against,
                    people plagiarizing our content from time to time, and if
                    you're right about what's going on, AI has achieved a level
                    of human intelligence that copies good content and makes it

                    Verizon Wireless gave a female victim's address and phone
                    logs to an alleged stalker who pretended to be a police
                    officer, according to an affidavit filed by an FBI special
                    agent. The man, Robert Michael Glauner, was later arrested
                    near the victim's home and found to be carrying a knife at
                    the time, according to the affidavit submitted in court
                    yesterday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Glauner allegedly traveled from New Mexico to Raleigh, North
                    Carolina, after finding out where she lived and, before
                    arriving, sent a threatening message that said, "if I can't
                    have you no one can." He also allegedly threatened to send
                    nude photos of the victim to her family members.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Glauner and the victim met in August or September 2023
                    on xhamster.com, a porn website with dating features, and
                    "had an online romantic relationship," the affidavit said.
                    The victim ended the relationship, but Glauner "continued to
                    contact or try to contact" her, the document said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Glauner tricked Verizon into providing sensitive information
                    by sending an email and fake search warrant to
                    vsat.cct@one.verizon.com, the email address for the Verizon
                    Security Assistance Team (VSAT), which handles legal
                    requests. Verizon didn't realize the request was fraudulent
                    even though it came from a Proton Mail address rather than
                    from a police department or other governmental agency,
                    according to the affidavit filed yesterday by FBI Special
                    Agent Michael Neylon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An email to Verizon from "steven1966c@proton.me" on
                    September 26, 2023, said, "Here is the pdf file for search
                    warrant. We are in need if the [<em>sic</em>] this cell
                    phone data as soon as possible to locate and apprehend this
                    suspect. We also need the full name of this Verizon
                    subscriber and the new phone number that has been assigned
                    to her. Thank you."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The email's attached document contained a fake affidavit
                    written by "Detective Steven Cooper" of the Cary, North
                    Carolina Police Department. The Cary Police Department
                    confirmed that no officer named Steven Cooper is employed by
                    their agency, Neylon wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But after reviewing the email and document sent by
                    "Cooper," Verizon provided an address and phone logs. "On
                    October 5, 2023, Verizon Wireless provided Victim 1's phone
                    records, including address and phone logs, to Glauner,"
                    according to Neylon's affidavit.

                    When a material exists as an ultrathin layer—a mere one or a
                    few atoms thick—it has totally different properties from
                    thicker samples of the same material. That's because
                    confining electrons to a 2D plane gives rise to exotic
                    states. Because of their flat dimensions and their broad
                    compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies, such
                    2D materials are promising for harnessing new phenomenon in
                    electronic devices.

                    These states include quantum spin Hall insulators, which
                    conduct electricity along their edges but are electrically
                    insulating in their interiors. Such systems when coupled
                    with superconductivity have been proposed as a route toward
                    engineering topological superconducting states that have
                    potential application in future topological quantum
                    computers.

                  <p>
                    Now, Michael Randle at the RIKEN Advanced Device Laboratory,
                    along with co-workers from RIKEN and Fujitsu, have created a
                    2D Josephson junction with active components entirely from a
                    material known to be a quantum spin Hall insulator. The work
                    is published in the journal Advanced Materials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Josephson junction is generally made by sandwiching a
                    material between two elemental superconductors. In contrast,
                    Randle and team fabricated their device from a single
                    crystal of monolayer 2D tungsten telluride, which had
                    previously been shown to exhibit both a superconducting
                    state and a quantum spin Hall insulator one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We fabricated the junction entirely from monolayer tungsten
                    telluride," says Randle. "We did this by exploiting its
                    ability to be tuned into and out of the superconducting
                    state using electrostatic gating."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The next step involves the implementation of
                    ultraflat pre-patterned gate structures by using, for
                    example, chemical–mechanical polishing," explains Randle.
                    "If this is achieved, we hope to form Josephson junctions
                    with precisely tailored geometries and to use our
                    cutting-edge microwave resonator experiment techniques to
                    observe and investigate the exciting topological nature of
                    the devices."

                    server, the latter can contact the DNS server and update the
                    client's DNS record," Akamai's Ori David explained.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the DHCP server registers or modifies a DNS record on
                    behalf of its clients, it uses DNS Dynamic Updates — and
                    therein lies the problem. DHCP DNS Dynamic Updates does not
                    require any authentication by the DHCP client, and Microsoft
                    DHCP servers enable DHCP DNS Dynamic Updates by default.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "So an attacker can essentially use the DHCP server to
                    authenticate to the DNS server on behalf of themself," David
                    said. "This grants the attacker access to the ADIDNS zone
                    without any credentials."

                  <p>
                    [...] In addition to creating non-existent DNS records,
                    unauthenticated attackers can also use the DHCP server to
                    overwrite existing data, including DNS records inside the
                    ADI zone in instances where the DHCP server is installed on
                    a domain controller, which David says is the case in 57
                    percent of the networks Akamai monitors.

                    The Hubble Space Telescope is expected to resume science
                    operations on Friday, after a gyroscope glitch forced NASA
                    to suspend astronomical observations for weeks.

                  <p>

                    operations can resume under three-gyro control," the US

                    in its latest update. "Based on the performance observed
                    during the tests, the team has decided to operate the gyros
                    in a higher-precision mode during science observations.
                    Hubble's instruments and the observatory itself remain
                    stable and in good health."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Launched in 1990, the telescope has been

                    multiple times over its decades-long lifetime. In 2009
                    Hubble was equipped with six new gyros. Only three remain
                    operational.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gyros measure how fast the telescope turns, and help it stay
                    fixed onto a cosmic target as it orbits in space. One of
                    them began behaving oddly, however, leading to faulty
                    readings – so Hubble automatically entered safe mode on
                    November 19.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "To date, three of those gyros remain operational,
                    including the gyro currently experiencing fluctuations.
                    Hubble uses three gyros to maximize efficiency, but could
                    continue to make science observations with only one gyro if
                    required," NASA explained.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The instrument should be able to keep studying stars and
                    galaxies and analyze their light in visible and ultraviolet
                    wavelengths until the end of this decade, and maybe into the
                    early 2030s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the telescope is slowly drifting from its intended orbit
                    – currently at about an altitude of 525 kilometers above
                    Earth's atmosphere. It's expected to drop to 500 kilometers
                    by 2025, and at this rate will be drawn down and reenter
                    Earth's atmosphere and be destroyed by the mid 2030s –
                    unless a rescue mission is carried out.

                    NASA hasn't quite decided on what it will do before then,

                    – either to help the Hubble execute a controlled reentry so
                    it's destroyed over the Pacific Ocean, or boost the
                    telescope higher into orbit so it can continue operating.

                    [...] The discovery also offers a rare clue into how
                    tyrannosaurs grew from one-meter-long at birth to some of
                    the biggest predators to have ever walked the Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This fossil is the first solid evidence that tyrannosaurids
                    drastically changed their diet as they grew from teenagers
                    to adults," Zelenitsky said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Young tyrannosaurs had slender heads and legs, sharp
                    knife-like teeth for dissecting carcasses, and could
                    probably run quite fast to catch their turkey-like prey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These youths probably looked more similar to the
                    velociraptors depicted in the movie "Jurassic Park" than the
                    giant T-Rex, Zelenitsky said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But at roughly 11 years old, as the tyrannosaurs hit their
                    middle-age, their bodies grew almost ten times in size,
                    ending up weighing more than 3,000 kilograms (6,600 pounds).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These kind of drastic dietary changes are not
                    necessarily rare in the animal kingdom—crocodiles and Komodo
                    dragons start out eating insects before switching to rodents
                    and eventually large mammals, Therrien said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers said the Gorgosaurus fossil supports the
                    theory that young tyrannosaurs—including the T-Rex—filled a
                    role in the food chain known as "mesopredators", before
                    later growing into apex predators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This change is "probably the reason why tyrannosaurs were so
                    successful and dominated their ecosystems at the end of the
                    Cretaceous in North America and Asia," Therrien said.

                    20 years ago, I got in a (friendly) public spat with Chris
                    Anderson, who was then the editor in chief of Wired. I'd
                    publicly noted my disappointment with glowing Wired reviews
                    of DRM-encumbered digital devices, prompting Anderson to
                    call me unrealistic for expecting the magazine to condemn
                    gadgets for their DRM:
                  </p>

                    noted that the company consistently purchased competing
                    repair centers in order to consolidate the sector and force
                    customers into using the company’s own repair facilities,

                    The market isn’t going to fix this problem by itself. It’s
                    clearly going to require a combination of antitrust reform,
                    regulatory action, new state/federal legislation, and
                    meaningful class action penalties before John Deere
                    executives finally get the message. And unfortunately for
                    them, right to repair reform continues to see stunning
                    levels of bipartisan public support.

                    Stealthy and multifunctional Linux malware that has been
                    infecting telecommunications companies went largely
                    unnoticed for two years until being documented for the first
                    time by researchers on Thursday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers from security firm Group-IB have named the
                    remote access trojan “Krasue,” after a nocturnal spirit
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasue"
                      >depicted in Southeast Asian folklore
                    </a>
                    “floating in mid-air, with no torso, just her intestines
                    hanging from below her chin.” The researchers chose the name
                    because evidence to date shows it almost exclusively targets
                    victims in Thailand and “poses a severe risk to critical
                    systems and sensitive data given that it is able to grant
                    attackers remote access to the targeted network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] During the initialization phase, the rootkit conceals
                    its own presence. It then proceeds to hook the
                    <b>`kill()`</b> syscall, network-related functions, and file
                    listing operations, thereby obscuring its activities and
                    evading detection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers have so far been unable to determine
                    precisely how Krasue gets installed. Possible infection
                    vectors include through vulnerability exploitation,
                    credential-stealing or -guessing attacks, or by unwittingly
                    being installed as trojan stashed in an installation file or
                    update masquerading as legitimate software.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Besides the rootkit functions, Krasue features an
                    installation file that's shielded inside a UPX, a so-called
                    packer that provides a cryptographic wrapper around the main
                    executable that can stymie detection by anti-virus software.
                    The Group-IB post provides indicators of compromise and
                    digital characteristics for detecting infected systems.

                    In the case of a captured asteroid origin, however, we are
                    more likely to find material on Phobos that is found on
                    other asteroids in our solar system. The prevailing
                    hypothesis in the #TeamCapture group is that the moons are
                    made up of the same rock as meteorites, called

                    Comparing meteorites and material brought back from Phobos
                    will be a fantastic tool for helping us understand the
                    origin of the two moons. Once we have material in the
                    laboratory, rigorous analytical techniques can be applied to
                    the samples.

                    are already firmly crossed for a successful launch, sample
                    acquisition, and sample return. Many scientists including
                    myself would absolutely love the possibility of one day
                    studying those samples.

                    That means that, in total, emissions from fossil fuels were
                    millions of times higher than carbon removal levels this
                    year. That ratio shows that it's "infeasible" for carbon
                    removal technologies to balance out emissions, O'Sullivan
                    says: "We cannot offset our way out of this problem."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The report also had bad news about nature-based approaches.
                    Efforts to pull carbon out of the atmosphere with methods
                    like reforestation and afforestation (in other words,
                    planting trees) accounted for more emissions removed from
                    the atmosphere than their technological counterparts.
                    However, even those efforts are still being canceled out by
                    current rates of deforestation and other land-use changes.

                  <p>
                    "The only way to solve this crisis is with major changes to
                    the fossil-fuel industry," O'Sullivan says. Technologies
                    like carbon removal "only become important if emissions are
                    drastically cut as well."

                      >Tor University Challenge</a

                    operate Tor relays. The primary goal of this campaign is to
                    strengthen the Tor network by creating more high bandwidth
                    and reliable Tor nodes. We hope this will also make the Tor
                    network more resilient to censorship since any country or
                    smaller network cutting off access to Tor means it would be
                    also cutting itself off from a large swath of universities,
                    academic knowledge, and collaborations.

                So far they have established contact with more pre-existing
                relays at universities, increased the number of relays in
                general running at universities, and cultivated better contact
                with the national-level university Internet connectivity
                organizations (NRENs). Some of the institutions have established
                public relays, and others even added new exit relays.

                    "The first signal was supposed to fire the mortar and
                    release the drogue," Lauretta said. "The second signal was
                    supposed to cut the cable to release the main... It looks
                    like the first signal cut the (cable), and then the second
                    signal fired the mortar, so it went backwards. But it
                    worked. We had lots of margin on that main chute. It landed
                    safely—a beautiful pinpoint landing in the Utah desert."<br />[...]<br />"In
                    the design plans for the system, the word 'main' was used
                    inconsistently between the device that sends the electric
                    signals, and the device that receives the signals," NASA
                    said in a written statement. "On the signal side, 'main'
                    meant the main parachute. In contrast, on the receiver side
                    'main' was used as a reference to a pyrotechnic that fires
                    to release the parachute canister cover and deploy the
                    drogue.

                    deployment actions to occur out of order," NASA said.

                    provides more concrete information than the old one while
                    also partially obfuscating the exact age of the various CPU

                    using older processor architectures in ostensibly "new"

                    The "Core Truths" deck takes particular issue with the Ryzen
                    7020 series, released in late 2022 and into 2023 but using
                    Zen 2-based CPU cores that date back to mid-2019. Intel
                    argues, not inaccurately, that a 13th-generation Core
                    i5-1335U chip can perform much better than a Ryzen 5 7520U,
                    despite both being marketed as recent releases.

                    My first reaction was to basically agree with Intel's
                    overall point; this was easy to do since the company used

                    to back up its argument.<br />[...]<br />My second reaction,
                    arrived at almost simultaneously, was to wonder why Intel
                    was taking so much issue with a practice that Intel itself
                    regularly uses to "refresh" its processor lineups.<br />[...]<br />"Rebranding
                    old technology to make it seem newer" is a trick that
                    practically all big chipmakers have resorted to at one time,
                    and Intel has a particularly rich history with it. The
                    mid-to-late-2010s manufacturing problems that lost Intel its
                    chipmaking technology lead also resulted in a whopping

                    [...] It's clear to me from my experience that this
                    treatment is not made for everyone, though. To receive
                    exa-cel, I spent a total of 17 weeks in the hospital. Not
                    everyone will want to subject themselves to such a grueling
                    process or be able to take time away from family obligations
                    or work. And my treatment was free as part of the trial—if
                    approved, exa-cel could cost millions of dollars per
                    patient.

                    [...] The options for treating sickle cell disease are very
                    limited. Denying access to such a powerful and
                    transformative treatment based on someone's ability to pay,
                    or where they happen to live, strikes me as unethical. I
                    believe patients and health-care providers everywhere
                    deserve to know that the treatment will be available to
                    those who need it.

                    actions. I fundamentally, at a cellular level, changed who I
                    am. Where do we draw the line at playing God? And how do we
                    make the benefits of a God-like technology such as this more

                Just when you thought the Do-Not-Track (DNT) privacy setting was
                gathering dust, a court in Berlin, Germany decided to exhume it.
                The Berlin Regional court ruled in favor of the Federation of
                German Consumer Organization (Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband,
                vzbv), in their lawsuit against LinkedIn for ignoring users who
                had enabled 'Do-Not-Track' in their browsers. According to the
                German judge, companies must respect DNT settings under the
                General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Different from the highly intrusive, often full-screen, GDPR
                    consent pop-ups that need to be addressed on each website
                    you visit, DNT is a single setting in your web browser that
                    works across all websites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a time where your every click is often scrutinized for
                    data collection or targeted ads, DNT puts the power of
                    privacy back in your hands. With this privacy flag, you're
                    able to browse the web on your terms while not having to
                    worry about who gets access to your personal information in
                    the process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ideally, websites should only prompt for permissions
                    contextually. For instance, it makes sense to ask for
                    permissions to share data with YouTube when you click play
                    on an embedded YouTube video. Also, well-designed websites
                    would ideally host videos themselves or use embedding
                    services that offer more control over privacy and data
                    collection than Google and its services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also, DNT does have its limitations because of its voluntary
                    nature because at the end of the day, websites can choose
                    whether or not to respect your request. It creates a
                    scenario similar to having a 'Keep Out' sign – some will
                    respect the warning and others will ignore it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, in light of the recent ruling in the Berlin
                    Regional Court against LinkedIn, this is a huge turning
                    point in the DNT initiative. This means LinkedIn can no
                    longer ignore its users' tracking preferences.
                  </p>

                    This ruling potentially creates a legal implication that a
                    DNT signal is legally binding and must be respected by
                    websites.

                    One attraction of Binance, as the company grew from its 2017
                    founding into the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the
                    world, was the firm's freewheeling flouting of rules. As it
                    amassed well over 100 million crypto-trading users globally,
                    it openly told the United States government that, as an
                    offshore operation, it didn't have to comply with the
                    country's financial regulations and money-laundering laws.

                    that Binance's executives had agreed to plead guilty to
                    criminal money-laundering charges, much of the attention on
                    that settlement focused on founder

                    and on the company's record-breaking $4.3 billion fine. But
                    Binance's settlement agreements with the DOJ and the US
                    Treasury Department also stipulate a strict new regime of

                    to law enforcement and regulators without notifying those
                    users. Now, the Binance settlement would create perhaps the
                    most extreme case yet of that crypto exchange data-sharing,
                    giving the US government wholesale access to the records of
                    a crypto hub that at some points processed billions of
                    transactions a day.<br />[...]<br />US law enforcement has
                    proven that even troves of exchange data that lack users'
                    names can nonetheless be highly revealing of their financial
                    history—especially in combination with blockchain data and
                    information from other exchanges that usually do comply with
                    know-your-customer laws. In the case of the

                    A federal bankruptcy court in Florida approved an agreement
                    Nov. 22 whereby SpaceX would acquire Pioneer Aerospace for
                    $2.2 million. The deal was

                    [....] Connecticut-based Pioneer has developed parachutes
                    for space and other applications for decades. That work
                    ranged from parafoils developed in the 1960s for potential
                    use on Gemini spacecraft to parachutes flown on Mars lander
                    missions and the OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule. It also
                    supplied drogue chutes for SpaceX's Crew Dragon and its
                    cargo variant.

                  <p>
                    [....] One industry source, speaking on background, said the
                    deal was likely an effort to preserve SpaceX's supply chain,
                    speculating that the cost to acquire Pioneer out of
                    bankruptcy may have been less than what SpaceX would have
                    spent on finding a new drogue chute supplier and
                    requalifying that component for use on crewed missions.

                    Both SpaceX and Boeing, the other company with a NASA
                    commercial crew contract, struggled to develop parachutes
                    for their spacecraft,

                    "Parachutes turned out to be way harder than we thought,"
                    said Phil McAlister, director of the commercial spaceflight
                    division at NASA Headquarters [....]

                Will Boeing have to pull strings to get parachutes from Pioneer
                Aerospace, or will their efforts fall flat?
