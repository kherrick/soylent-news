                    One of the world's largest mobile data brokers, Kochava, has
                    lost its battle to stop the Federal Trade Commission from
                    revealing what the FTC has alleged is a disturbing,
                    widespread pattern of unfair use and sale of sensitive data
                    without consent from hundreds of millions of people.

                    The FTC has accused Kochava of violating the FTC Act by
                    amassing and disclosing "a staggering amount of sensitive
                    and identifying information about consumers," alleging that
                    Kochava's database includes products seemingly capable of
                    identifying nearly every person in the United States.<br />[...]<br />the
                    FTC is seeking a permanent injunction to stop Kochava from

                    to unseal the amended complaint that the FTC still has to
                    prove that Kochava has violated the FTC Act, but its
                    arguments are sufficient to survive Kochava's motion for
                    sanctions, which the judge's order also denied.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Winmill, Kochava "has not offered any
                    compelling reason to maintain the amended complaint under
                    seal."
                  </p>

                    "Certainly, the FTC's allegations cast Kochava's services in
                    an unfavorable light," Winmill wrote. "But that is no reason
                    to shield the complaint from public view."

                    that the ruling was "a promising turnaround in a landmark
                    FTC action against a major data broker" and noted that
                    unsealing the complaint has now revealed "Kochava's shocking
                    appetite for the most sensitive details of lives and the
                    ways the company uses that data to profile, target,
                    discriminate, and profit."<br />[...]<br />Winmill said that
                    for now, the FTC has provided enough support for its
                    allegations against Kochava for the lawsuit to proceed.

                So much for the temporary delay or ban on AI. Musk named his AI
                Grok. I'm surprised by the lack of X:es in the name. Perhaps it
                would have looked odd considering the name of the Musk AI
                Company is xAI.
              </p>
              <p>
                Somewhat unclear if the Grok is referring to Hitchhikers guide
                to the Galaxy Grok or to Heinleins Stranger in a Strange Land.
                If you take inspiration from Hitchhikers then it shouldn't be
                that hard to program. If all else fails, the answer to a query
                is always 42. So I guess we'll know what it will default to when
                it starts looping hallucinations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also Grok should apparently be really into sarcasm, so that will
                end well and not lead to any kind of misunderstandings or
                interpretations. None.

                    Chang noted that longer periods of sleep recovery may be
                    necessary to recover from multiple, consecutive nights of
                    sleep loss.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Sleep is a biological process, but it's also a behavioral
                    one and one that we often have a lot of control over," Chang
                    said. "Not only does sleep affect our cardiovascular health,
                    but it also affects our weight, our mental health, our
                    ability to focus and our ability to maintain healthy
                    relationships with others, among many other things. As we
                    learn more and more about the importance of sleep, and how
                    it impacts everything in our lives, my hope is that it will
                    become more of a focus for improving one's health."

                    All of the previous lanterns I've talked about use the flame
                    as a source of light - carbureted in various ways, but
                    "carbon in the flame glowing directly." A mantle is a device
                    that, when heated, glows brightly in the visible regions -
                    it puts out more light than a blackbody radiator at a given
                    temperature, because it uses materials that are low
                    emissivity in the infrared spectrum (heat), and high
                    emissivity in the visible spectrum (light, useful to
                    humans). There are also some benefits from helping contain
                    the flame and the heat within the enclosure, but the end
                    result is rather more light for a given amount of heat than
                    you'd otherwise get.

                I remember similar lanterns from my childhood, including the

                many of our community have ever seen these lanterns anywhere
                other than on TV or in movies? Does anyone here still use a
                similar lamp? - JR

                    Some years ago I wrote about programming a KIM-1 in 1985. By
                    that time the KIM-1 was old, and definitely not state of the
                    art. After all, it was released in 1976.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it's a machine I enjoyed programming (which required
                    punching in code via the hex keypad, or, if you were lucky,
                    connecting a terminal (via a 20mA current loop designed to
                    talk to an actual Teletype) to it and using the very basic
                    monitor program). The KIM-1 could also interface to a
                    paper-tape reader/punch and a cassette for storing and
                    loading programs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have a tiny collection of machines that matter in my
                    personal computing history: a Sharp MZ-80K, a Research
                    Machines 380Z, a Research Machines 480Z, my original BBC
                    Micro and a KIM-1 (that's a picture of my machine above).
                    The (fully working) KIM-1 was made in 1976 and is serial
                    number 2,793. It's still sitting in its original packaging:

                    European space officials will convene on Monday and Tuesday
                    to discuss the future of space policy for the continent. The
                    "Space Summit" gathering in Seville, Spain, will encompass
                    several topics, including the future of launch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the decade since [the Ariane 6] agreement was
                    reached there have been at least three factors that have
                    precipitated a crisis in European launch. One is the rise of
                    SpaceX, which, through its reusable Falcon 9 rocket, has
                    come to dominate the commercial market with prices about
                    half those offered by the Ariane rockets. Because it has
                    optimized for speed, SpaceX can also launch far more
                    frequently and efficiently than Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Secondly, the Ariane 6 rocket has been delayed from its
                    original goal of launching in 2020. Now, if hot-fire tests
                    late this year go well, it is possible that the Ariane 6
                    rocket could make its debut launch by mid-2024, or about
                    four years late. With the retirement of the Ariane 5, and
                    the Russian Soyuz rocket off the market due to the war in
                    Ukraine, Europe finds itself in the embarrassing position of
                    having to rely on SpaceX to get some of its
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/07/europes-euclid-telescope-launched-to-study-the-dark-universe/"

                    into orbit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, there is the cost issue. The goal of reducing
                    operations costs by 50 percent has dropped to 40 percent.
                    And now, citing inflation, European officials say those cost
                    cuts are not sustainable. In fact, the Ariane 6 rocket's
                    primary contractor, ArianeGroup—which is co-owned by Airbus
                    and Safran—is asking for a significant subsidy to operate
                    the rocket.
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/10/oops-it-looks-like-the-ariane-6-rocket-may-not-offer-europe-any-launch-savings/"
                      >It wants 350 million euros a year</a
                    >, which would essentially wipe out any cost savings from
                    going to the Ariane 6 rocket.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So Europe has spent a decade and many billions of euros
                    developing the Ariane 6 rocket, but all it has gotten them
                    to date is a gap in the capability of launching satellites
                    to orbit. This has ratcheted up tensions heading into
                    Seville this week.

                    Representatives from 22 European countries reached an
                    agreement Monday to change the way the continent's rockets
                    are developed, moving from a government-driven approach to a
                    commercial paradigm that appears to be modeled after how
                    NASA and the US military do business.

                  Australia's news.com.au reports:</a
                ><br />During the Covid pandemic, restaurants introduced QR Code
                menu ordering in an attempt to minimize contact between staff
                and patrons. Australian restaurants have continued this trend
                while taking it to new levels of absurdity, sparking a recent
                flurry of criticism on social media.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I'm so f***ing tired of 'tech' being used to solve an 'issue'
                but only making everything worse and more inconvenient for
                everybody," one Aussie wrote. Followed by a deluge of replies
                and comments.
              </p>
              <p>
                His comment was in response to going to a restaurant and having
                only a QR code to order from - literally a menu at the table
                with only the QR code on it. The app required to order from it
                "proceeded to charge a 6.5% venue surcharge, a 2% payment
                processing fee, and then had the audacity to ask for a tip (10%,
                15%, 25%) as the cherry on top.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hundreds of others enthusiastically agreed and many added they
                also didn't like being asked to enter their personal details.
                "You're waiting your own table and paying an extra fee for the
                privilege. It's f***ed," one person responded. "It's also a big
                stinking FU to anyone old or not tech savvy. All just to hoover
                up your data," another added.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some, however, shared they preferred using QR codes to order
                their food - they removed the need to move to order more and
                limited engagement with staff. "I actually like the QR ordering
                because I don't like people, but the surcharges and tipping can
                f*** off," one said. "I love the QR codes - don't need to leave
                the table to order another beer," someone else wrote...
              </p>
              <p>
                Jonathan Holmes-Ross, owner of board game restaurant, The Lost
                Dice in Adelaide told news.com.au that the use of QR code
                ordering had let his eatery "reduce costs by around 25%... We no
                longer have to take orders, work out bills and manually take
                payments," he said. "This gives our wait staff more time to look
                after our customers, and the kitchen has excellent order
                information as the accuracy of the orders is great. We now have
                very few mistakes saving us time and waste. We can also mark
                items that have run out instantly on the app by using stock
                levels, again avoiding the disappointment of (the) customer."

                    the Big Tech duo of not only gathering up information about
                    sellers using their respective online souks, they also -

                    In Amazon's case, the e-commerce giant used vendors' sales

                    to price products to get an edge over everyone else. The

                    the online souk will be prevented from using third-party
                    seller data that gives it an unfair commercial advantage,
                    and will allow rivals to negotiate rates with independent
                    delivery contractors working on behalf of Amazon.

                    The social media mega-corp was accused of exploiting
                    advertisers hawking wares on Facebook Marketplace, and using
                    competitors' data to improve its own products or services.

                    "Going forward, competitors of Facebook Marketplace that
                    advertise on Meta platforms can 'opt out' of their data
                    being used to improve Facebook Marketplace. Without these
                    measures in place, Meta risks having an unfair competitive
                    advantage that could distort competition," the CMA said.

                  <p>
                    "Having assessed the commitments and the feedback received,
                    including from sellers, advertisers and customers, we
                    believe both sets of commitments address the specific
                    competition concerns we had here in the UK," Ann Pope, the
                    watchdog's senior director for antitrust enforcement,
                    concluded.

                    Previously unreported figures from ad blocking companies
                    indicate that YouTube's crackdown is working, with hundreds
                    of thousands of people uninstalling ad blockers in October.
                    The available data suggests that last month saw a record
                    number of ad blockers uninstalled - and also a record for
                    new ad blocker installs as people sought alternatives that
                    wouldn't trigger YouTube's dreaded pop-up.

                    Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a free alternative
                    that's guaranteed to work perfectly on an indefinite basis
                    right now.

                    One popular browser extension called
                    <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> seems
                    to be the easiest and best bet right now, with users
                    claiming it works best on Firefox (though it's worked for me
                    on Chrome, too).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some folks are switching browsers to Firefox or even
                    Microsoft Edge just to find a way to watch YouTube videos in
                    peace.

                  <p>
                    The problem with this is that YouTube will almost certainly
                    weed out working alternatives over time, so some degree of
                    adaptability may be required here on the user end. Or, you
                    could just give in and pay for YouTube Premium. It's not fun
                    or ideal, but you can at least guarantee it'll work.

                    As for the new chips, both feature a hybrid core
                    architecture and include a combination of Zen 4 and Zen 4c
                    cores. The more high-end one is the Ryzen 5 7545U, which is
                    a 6-core, 12-thread part with 2 Zen 4 cores and 4 Zen 4c
                    cores. It comes with a 3.2GHz base clock and a 4.9GHz boost
                    clock, a 15-30W TDP range, and Radeon 740M integrated
                    graphics. The 7545U has 22MB of total cache, including 16MB
                    of L3.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The other new chip in AMD's portfolio is the Ryzen 3 7440U,
                    which is a 4-core, 8-thread part with a base clock of 3GHz
                    and a boost clock of up to 4.7GHz. It has the same TDP range
                    of 15-30W as the Ryzen 5 part, but only offers 12MB of total
                    cache, including 8MB of L3. Like the 7545U, the 7440U also
                    comes with Radeon 740M integrated graphics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new hybrid core architecture has thrown a spotlight on
                    the new Zen 4c cores, with obvious questions about how they
                    differ from Zen 4. According to AMD, the new cores are
                    designed for density and power efficiency and are 35 percent
                    smaller than Zen 4. The new core architecture also offers
                    better scalability, with the potential for allowing higher
                    core counts in future high-end mobile processors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company claimed that Zen 4c is a great option for
                    entry-level devices, as the smaller cores with the same IPC
                    consume less power than Zen 4, allowing the chips to deliver
                    more performance below 15W. However, Zen 4 still supports a
                    higher absolute clock limit compared to Zen 4c, enabling the
                    new hybrid chips to offer optimized performance in heavy
                    workloads while delivering a high degree of efficiency.

                Sunflowers famously turn their faces to follow the sun as it
                crosses the sky. But how do sunflowers "see" the sun to follow
                it? New work from plant biologists at the University of
                California, Davis, published Oct. 31 in PLOS Biology, shows that
                they use a different, novel mechanism from that previously
                thought.
              </p>
              <p>
                "This was a total surprise for us," said Stacey Harmer,
                professor of plant biology at UC Davis and senior author on the
                paper.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most plants show phototropism—the ability to grow toward a light
                source. Plant scientists had assumed that sunflowers'
                heliotropism, the ability to follow the sun, would be based on
                the same basic mechanism, which is governed by molecule called
                phototropin and responds to light at the blue end of the
                spectrum.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sunflowers swing their heads by growing a little more on the
                east side of the stem—pushing the head west—during the day and a
                little more on the west side at night, so the head swings back
                toward the east. Harmer's lab at the UC Davis College of
                Biological Sciences has previously shown how sunflowers use
                their internal circadian clock to anticipate the sunrise, and to
                coordinate the opening of florets with the appearance of
                pollinating insects in the morning.

                    Whether we like it or not, we all use the cloud to
                    communicate and to store and process our data. We use dozens
                    of cloud services, sometimes indirectly and unwittingly. We
                    do so because the cloud brings real benefits to individuals
                    and organizations alike. We can access our data across
                    multiple devices, communicate with anyone from anywhere, and
                    command a remote data center's worth of power from a
                    handheld device.

                    But using the cloud means our security and privacy now
                    depend on cloud providers. Remember: The cloud is just
                    another way of saying "someone else's computer." Cloud
                    providers are single points of failure and prime targets for
                    hackers to scoop up everything from proprietary corporate
                    communications to our personal photo albums and financial
                    documents.

                    companies use their access—benefiting from weak laws,
                    complex software, and lax oversight—to mine and sell our

                    Our message is simple: It is possible to get the best of
                    both worlds. We can and should get the benefits of the cloud
                    while taking security back into our own hands. Here we
                    outline a strategy for doing that.

                  <p>
                    In the last few years, a slew of ideas old and new have
                    converged to reveal a path out of this morass, but they
                    haven't been widely recognized, combined, or used. These
                    ideas, which we'll refer to in the aggregate as
                    "decoupling," allow us to rethink both security and privacy.

                    Here's the gist. The less someone knows, the less they can
                    put you and your data at risk. In security this is called
                    Least Privilege. The

                      href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2022/papers/hotnets22_schmitt.pdf"
                      >decoupling principle</a
                    >
                    applies that idea to cloud services by making sure systems
                    know as little as possible while doing their jobs. It states
                    that we gain security and privacy by separating private data
                    that today is unnecessarily concentrated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The needed protocols and infrastructure exist, and
                    there are services that can do all of this already, without
                    sacrificing the performance, quality, and usability of
                    conventional cloud services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But we cannot just rely on industry to take care of this.
                    Self-regulation is a time-honored stall tactic: A piecemeal
                    or superficial tech-only approach would likely undermine the
                    will of the public and regulators to take action. We need a
                    belt-and-suspenders strategy, with government policy that
                    mandates decoupling-based best practices, a tech sector that
                    implements this architecture, and public awareness of both
                    the need for and the benefits of this better way forward.

                    Forty percent of parents who worked remotely during the
                    COVID-19 pandemic reported higher parenting stress compared
                    with only 27 percent of parents who worked onsite, reports a
                    new survey from scientists at Northwestern University and

                    The study results revealed a gender difference: Fathers who
                    worked from home were twice as likely to report that
                    parenting was stressful all or most of the time compared to
                    fathers who worked onsite. Parenting stress for mothers who
                    worked at home was slightly higher, but it did not reach
                    statistical significance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study found no differences in mental or general health
                    between parents who worked remotely or onsite.

                  <p>
                    "Our survey results show that teleworking during the
                    pandemic was associated with more parenting stress,
                    especially for fathers," said lead author Dr. John James
                    Parker, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern
                    University Feinberg School of Medicine and a pediatrician at
                    Lurie Children's. "This might be a reflection of societal
                    expectations that men should prioritize work obligations
                    over family needs, which creates additional stress for
                    fathers working from home."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The study authors recommend parents reflect on their
                    family and work situation and try to find an arrangement
                    that limits stress and promotes well-being.

                  <p>
                    "This can be as simple as putting a noise-cancelling machine
                    in the workspace, rearranging schedules to limit
                    distractions and planning time for parents to step away from
                    work to be fully engaged with their children," said Parker,

                According to an observational study cats are found to have at

                    Each of the cat's expressions was made up of a mix of four
                    out of 26 unique facial movements - things like open mouths,
                    wide or small pupils, blinks, nose licks, whisker movements,
                    and ear positions. By comparison, humans have around 44
                    unique facial movements, and dogs have 27, but the total
                    number of expressions isn't known. Of the recorded facial
                    expressions, around 45% were thought to be friendly, and 37%
                    were more aggressive or angry, with the leftover 18% an
                    unclear mixture of the two.

                    nonsocial species," says Daniel Mills, a veterinary
                    behaviorist at the University of Lincoln who was not
                    involved in the study. The facial expressions described in
                    the new study suggest otherwise, he notes. "There is clearly
                    a lot going on that we are not aware of."

                    new study. One day it might be used to design an app to help
                    cat owners better understand their pets' subtle cues, she
                    adds. "This could really help the cat-human bond."

                    X has banned the account of a prominent critic after he
                    published data that he claims exposed the site's embrace of
                    the far-right after Elon Musk's takeover last year.

                    reports claiming that far-right influencers featured
                    prominently among Twitter Blue subscribers, and how
                    thousands of previously banned X accounts, including members
                    of the far-right, were being reinstated on the site.

                  <p>
                    On Tuesday, Brown announced his decision to challenge his
                    account's suspension in court in Berlin. "This is a matter
                    of principle," he says. "I think it is important that
                    platforms like Twitter are not allowed to shut down
                    criticism arbitrarily." X did not reply to repeated requests
                    for comment.<br />[...]<br />The legal proceedings in
                    Germany are ongoing. For Ballon, the best case scenario
                    would be if the court reinstates Brown's account again or
                    rules the block to be unlawful. The worst outcome would be
                    if the court declines to rule on the case because X's
                    European Union headquarters are based in Ireland. HateAid is

                    explains that the halo was created by Vikram's descent stage

                  <p>
                    The halo was described as an "irregular bright patch

                    The discovery sheds some light into Moon dust material and

                    [...] The fine yet abrasive silicate-heavy material on the
                    lunar surface has proven to be hazardous for all 12 past
                    humans that have set foot on the Moon.

                      >European Space Agency</a
                    >, exposure to Moon dust caused symptoms ranging from
                    wheezing to nasal congestion that lasted for days in some
                    cases, and made the inside of the Apollo 17 spacecraft smell
                    like gunpowder.

                  <p>
                    The problem is compounded by the low gravity on the Moon,
                    which keeps epiregolith particles suspended in air within
                    spacecraft.

                Coding with the pope: Catholic school children are going to be
                tempted to learn to code with the Pope. Or the pope is going to
                tell them to learn to code, cause that is what God wants? One
                imagines it will be a bigger draw in catholic countries, not so
                much in the rest of the world. Unless the program is really good
                and can be used by heathens and heretics to.

              <p>
                Apparently the Pope, or God or some other earthly minion picked

                So the pope isn't working on his own backup- or retirement
                career then. It's more of a do as I say, not do as I do. Or
                don't.

                  <p>
                    For centuries, naturalists have puzzled over what might
                    constitute the head of a sea star, commonly called a
                    "starfish." When looking at a worm, or a fish, it's clear
                    which end is the head and which is the tail. But with their
                    five identical arms—any of which can take the lead in
                    propelling sea stars across the seabed—it's been anybody's
                    guess how to determine the front end of the organism from
                    the back. This unusual body plan has led many to conclude
                    that sea stars perhaps don't have a head at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But now, labs at Stanford University and UC Berkeley, each
                    led by Chan Zuckerberg Biohub San Francisco Investigators,
                    have published a study finding that the truth is closer to
                    the absolute reverse. In short, while the team detected gene
                    signatures associated with head development just about
                    everywhere in juvenile sea stars, expression of genes that
                    code for an animal's torso and tail sections were largely
                    missing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers used a variety of high-tech molecular and
                    genomic techniques to understand where different genes were
                    expressed during the development and growth of sea stars. A
                    team at Southampton used micro-CT scanning to understand the
                    shape and structure of the animal in unprecedented detail.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In another surprising finding, molecular signatures
                    typically associated with the front-most portion of the head
                    were localized to the middle of each of the sea star's arms,
                    with these signatures becoming progressively more posterior
                    moving out towards the arms' edges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "It's as if the sea star is completely missing a
                    trunk, and is best described as just a head crawling along
                    the seafloor," said Laurent Formery, a postdoctoral scholar
                    and lead author of the new study. "It's not at all what
                    scientists have assumed about these animals."

                    Disney has said Hulu has been profitable some quarters, but
                    anonymous "industry executives" cited in an April report
                    from
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/comcasts-roberts-has-upper-hand-over-iger-as-hulu-battle-looms"

                    >
                    said they thought Hulu was worth less than its 2019
                    valuation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The April report also cited "three people with knowledge of
                    the matter," who claimed that "accounting rules allow
                    entertainment companies to report content costs on their
                    profit statements over a period of years, which is why a
                    service can report a profit even if it is burning cash. And
                    as of last year, Hulu's content, technology, and personnel
                    costs outweighed the revenue it generates," The Information
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As of July 1, Hulu was said to have 48.3 million
                    subscribers. In May, Disney+ said it had 146.1 million
                    subscribers, but that was after it

                    losses were $512 million.

                    As it stands, though, Disney appears to be committed to the

                    phones more than 20 times a day had a 21% higher risk for a

                    for a low sperm concentration, a less important measure of
                    sperm count in a milliliter of semen. The study did not

                    I am able to explain," said Allan Pacey, deputy vice

                    medicine and health at the University of Manchester in the

                    Going forward, Uber and Lyft drivers in New York State will
                    get paid sick leave. The companies must also provide hiring
                    notices that "accurately explain the earnings to which
                    drivers are entitled for their work" and earnings statements
                    that "accurately detail the compensation earned for each pay
                    period," the announcement said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Uber and Lyft must "notify drivers after each ride of the
                    amount paid by the rider," provide the right to "appeal all
                    deactivations from the Uber and Lyft platforms," and offer
                    in-app chat support in multiple languages.

                  <p>
                    In parts of the state outside New York City, drivers will
                    receive at least $26 per hour, adjusted annually for
                    inflation. Drivers in New York City will continue to receive

                    the settlement "prioritizes the benefits drivers want
                    without sacrificing the independence and flexibility they
                    need." It "builds on the benefits and protections that
                    drivers already enjoy through the state's Black Car Fund,
                    which provides accident disability and workers'
                    compensation, dental and vision coverage, telemedicine
                    services, and more," Lyft said.

                    And, well, it's kind of really weird. The surface of the
                    fluid seems to form an independent two-dimensional layer
                    that transports heat away from the rod. The bulk of the
                    superfluid underneath it acts almost like a vacuum; it's
                    entirely passive and doesn't feel like anything at all, the
                    researchers found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The only part of the fluid that interacted with the probe
                    was that two-dimensional surface layer. The bulk only
                    becomes accessible if a huge burst of energy is imparted
                    into it. The thermomechanical properties of the superfluid
                    are entirely defined by that two-dimensional layer.

                    "This liquid would feel two-dimensional if you could stick
                    your finger into it. The bulk of the superfluid feels empty,
                    while heat flows in a two-dimensional subsystem along the
                    edges of the bulk – in other words, along your finger,"
                    Autti says.

                    Evaporation is happening all around us all the time, from
                    the sweat cooling our bodies to the dew burning off in the
                    morning sun. But science's understanding of this ubiquitous
                    process may have been missing a piece all this time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In recent years, some researchers have been puzzled upon
                    finding that water in their experiments, which was held in a
                    sponge-like material known as a hydrogel, was evaporating at
                    a higher rate than could be explained by the amount of heat,
                    or thermal energy, that the water was receiving. The excess
                    has been significant—a doubling, or even a tripling or more,
                    of the theoretical maximum rate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After carrying out a series of new experiments and
                    simulations, and reexamining some of the results from
                    various groups that claimed to have exceeded the thermal
                    limit, a team of researchers at MIT has reached a startling
                    conclusion: Under certain conditions, at the interface where
                    water meets air, light can directly bring about evaporation
                    without the need for heat, and it actually does so even more
                    efficiently than heat. In these experiments, the water was
                    held in a hydrogel material, but the researchers suggest
                    that the phenomenon may occur under other conditions as
                    well.

                    this year, the good folks at the New England Journal of
                    Medicine offer some fresh nightmare fuel ahead of Halloween:
                    an ear spider. And there's a video.

                    >, doctors in Tainan City, Taiwan, detail the case of a
                    64-year-old woman who sought care at an otolaryngology (ENT)
                    clinic. She came in complaining of having an incessant
                    ruckus in her left ear for the previous four days. On the
                    first day of symptoms, the woman said she was awoken by a
                    feeling of a wee creature crawling in her ear canal. That
                    feeling was then followed by days of clicking, beating, and
                    rustling noises.<br />[...]<br />Video of the creepy crawler
                    shows it darting around the canal, just in front of the
                    eardrum. When it spots the medical probe nearing, the spider
                    comes in for a closer look, facing the camera directly for a
                    perfect view of its eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The medical report doesn't identify the type of spider it
                    is, and it's usually very difficult to identify spiders
                    based on pictures. But Ars reached out to two spider experts
                    who both said the spider is, without a doubt, in the family
                    of jumping spiders (Salticidae). The giveaway is "the
                    family-specific arrangement and size ratio of the eyes,"
                    Martin Nyffeler, an emeritus senior lecturer in zoology at
                    the University of Basel, told Ars over email. Specifically,
                    this family of spiders has large median front eyes, which
                    can be seen in the ear spider when it looks directly into
                    the camera.<br />[...]<br />The doctors treating the woman
                    reported no damage to her eardrum. They sucked the spider
                    and its exuvia out, and the woman's symptoms "immediately
                    abated," they reported
                  </p>

                    often been credited to paper manufacturer Zenas Marshall
                    Crane, who introduced this practice in 1844. But Manukyan
                    and his team found evidence that Franklin was including
                    colored silks in his paper much earlier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team also discovered that notes printed by Franklin's
                    network have a distinctive look due to the addition of a
                    translucent material they identified as muscovite. The team
                    determined that Franklin began adding muscovite to his
                    papers and the size of this muscovite crystals in his paper
                    increased over time. The team speculates that Franklin
                    initially began adding muscovite to make the printed notes
                    more durable but continued to add it when it proved to be a
                    helpful deterrent to counterfeiters.

                    It's become so darn easy to order stuff thanks to the
                    miracles of online shopping. But it's not so simple on the
                    retailer end, especially when more than 16 per cent of those
                    sales are later sent back. In the U.S., that adds up to a
                    staggering $816 billion in lost revenue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cross-selling can help, say a pair of researchers. Their
                    experiments show that once we've chosen to buy something, we
                    tend to consider that money as already spent or gone, also
                    called "loss booking." If we decide we want to return the
                    item, retailers can take advantage of that tendency by
                    giving customers enticing options to spend their refund on
                    something else, instead of getting their money back.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a nutshell, "it hurts less to spend money refunded from a
                    product return than other money, because you feel like
                    you've already lost it," says researcher Chang-Yuan Lee, an
                    assistant professor of marketing at the University of
                    Toronto's Rotman School of Management.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There's a catch though. The shopper has to
                    psychologically mark the initial spend as lost, something
                    that does not happen when they expect to ask for a refund at
                    the time of purchase. Study participants who bought two
                    pairs of shoes in different sizes, expecting to return the
                    poorer-fitting pair, were not so likely to turn around and
                    immediately apply the refund to something else offered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While consumers could be discouraged from making
                    returns by being charged extra fees, that leaves a bad taste
                    in their mouth and previous research has shown they may take
                    their business elsewhere.

                    to his problem-solving efforts from ground control has died
                    at the age of 87.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thomas K. "TK" Mattingly passed away on October 31, the
                    space agency said in a statement Thursday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    His most dramatic role came when he was assigned as command
                    module pilot for the Apollo 13 flight but was grounded 72
                    hours prior to launch due to exposure to rubella, NASA
                    Administrator Bill Nelson said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After an explosion crippled the spacecraft on its way to the
                    Moon, Mattingly, who did not in fact get sick, went to
                    Mission Control and devised procedures to conserve power so
                    the vehicle could successfully re-enter the atmosphere,
                    ensuring astronauts James Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred
                    Haise survived.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mattingly began his career as a US Navy pilot before
                    being selected to the astronaut class of 1966. He later took
                    on the role of command module pilot on the Apollo 16 mission
                    and was the spacecraft commander in two Space Shuttle
                    missions.

                    [...] It is now up to the judge, Lewis Kaplan, to determine
                    what Bankman-Fried's sentence will be. While the charges
                    carry a statutory minimum of 110 years, and sentencing
                    guidelines provide a type of formula, the judge has
                    wide-ranging discretion to rule below that guidance.
                    However, CBS News legal analyst Rikki Klieman says if Judge
                    Kaplan "believes the defendant was committing perjury in his
                    courtroom, he might even go above the guidelines."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For her part, Tien, the former FTX employee, said that jail
                    time might too harsh, wondering if Bankman-Fried could
                    perhaps instead help the government investigate other
                    potential crypto-trading fraud.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The next trial in the saga of the United States vs. Sam
                    Bankman-Fried is scheduled for March, 11, 2024, when other
                    charges that the government did not bring forward will be
                    folded into yet another court proceeding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This trial concludes almost one year to the day FTX stopped
                    allowing customers to withdraw deposits, which marked the
                    beginning of the end of the so-called crypto king's meteoric
                    rise.

                    announced today (Oct. 31) that it has wrapped up its

                  <p>
                    However, there's still another regulatory box to check
                    before
                    <a href="https://www.space.com/18853-spacex.html">SpaceX</a>

                    "The FAA is continuing to work on the environmental review,"
                    the agency wrote today in an emailed statement. "As part of
                    its environmental review, the FAA is consulting with the
                    U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) on an updated
                    Biological Assessment under the Endangered Species Act. The
                    FAA and the USFWS must complete this consultation before the
                    environmental review portion of the license evaluation is
                    completed."

                    environmental and other applicable regulatory requirements
                    prior to the next Starship launch," the agency wrote at the
                    time.

                  <p>
                    And, as today's FAA update notes, there's still work to do

                    A new study has revealed that when news sites temporarily
                    relax or suspend restrictions tied to paywall access, they
                    eventually see an increase in subscribers. This reinforces
                    the power and value of sampling as a marketing strategy. But
                    there's more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers found that when some news
                    organizations temporarily suspended paywall restrictions on
                    certain stories of public interest, such as the COVID-19
                    pandemic or U.S. presidential election, or when they
                    provided free access up to a certain number of articles,
                    those new visitors were more likely to become subscribers
                    when the restrictions were reimposed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our analyses revealed that the temporary paywall
                    suspensions not only increased the amount of traffic during
                    the suspension period, but also increased the likelihood
                    that those visitors would become paid subscribers," says
                    Chae. "We further found that the variety of content consumed
                    during their period of 'free' access increased the
                    likelihood that visitors would actually choose to
                    subscribe."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "One of the business concerns within news
                    organizations is that relaxing the paywall for major events
                    will cannibalize paid consumption," says Ha. "But this
                    dynamic is effectively counteracted by an expansion where
                    consumers who weren't willing to pay before have now gotten
                    a taste of the content. That exposure lets them experience
                    its value, relieving the consumer's uncertainty and helping
                    to build a stronger relationship with that site visitor."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "One of the underlying factors that may also contribute to
                    the positive effects of relaxed paywall subscription during
                    certain times of important news is the public service aspect
                    of the gesture, which helps to build trust with the public
                    and the news consumer," adds Schweidel. "So, not only is the
                    temporary suspension of paywall restrictions good business,
                    but it also fulfills a societal obligation that news
                    organizations have to keep the public informed."

                    presented to the public and parliament for a rubber stamp
                    before the end of the year. New legislative articles,
                    introduced in recent closed-door meetings and not yet
                    public, envision that all web browsers distributed in Europe
                    will be required to trust the certificate authorities and
                    cryptographic keys selected by EU governments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These changes radically expand the capability of EU
                    governments to surveil their citizens by ensuring
                    cryptographic keys under government control can be used to
                    intercept encrypted web traffic across the EU. Any EU member
                    state has the ability to designate cryptographic keys for
                    distribution in web browsers and browsers are forbidden from
                    revoking trust in these keys without government permission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This enables the government of any EU member state to issue
                    website certificates for interception and surveillance which
                    can be used against every EU citizen, even those not
                    resident in or connected to the issuing member state. There
                    is no independent check or balance on the decisions made by
                    member states with respect to the keys they authorize and
                    the use they put them to. This is particularly troubling
                    given that adherence to the rule of law has

                    The introduction of this text so late in the legislative

                    in late June, the announcement doesn't even mention website

                    it extremely difficult for civil society, academics and the
                    general public to scrutinize or even be aware of the laws

                    On Friday, Google started defending its search business
                    during the Justice Department's monopoly trial. Among the
                    first witnesses called was Google's senior vice president
                    responsible for search, Prabhakar Raghavan, who testified
                    that Google's default agreements with makers of popular
                    mobile phones and web browsers were "the company's biggest
                    cost" in 2021,
                    <a
                      href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/google-paid-26-3-billion-to-be-default-search-engine-in-2021"

                  <p>
                    Raghavan's testimony for the first time revealed that Google
                    paid $26.3 billion in 2021 for default agreements, seemingly
                    investing in default status for its search engine while
                    raking in $146.4 billion in revenue from search advertising
                    that year. Those numbers had increased "significantly" since
                    2014,

                    billion and traffic acquisition cost was approximately $7.1
                    billion.<br />[...]<br />Pichai will likely provide
                    additional insights into how Google's smart investments are
                    responsible for creating the search empire it maintains

                      >reported</a
                    >. But he will also likely face the DOJ's inquiries into why
                    Google invests so much in default agreements if it's not a
                    critical part of the tech giant's strategy to stay ahead of
                    the competition.

                    The DOJ is not likely to back down from its case that
                    default agreements unfairly secured Google's search market
                    dominance. On Friday, Big Tech on Trial reporter Yosef

                    that things have gotten tense in the courtroom now that the
                    "DOJ seems emboldened to push for more information to be
                    public after Judge Mehta's comments yesterday that not all

                    >, the DOJ today pushed to "make public the 20 search
                    queries Google makes the most revenue off of, as well as
                    Google's traffic acquisition costs related to search (the
                    total amount of money Google paid to partners in search

                    Researchers have successfully grown mouse embryos aboard the
                    International Space Station (ISS) for the first time.

                    This represents "the first-ever study that shows mammals may
                    be able to thrive in space," the University of Yamanashi and
                    National Research Institute Riken said in a
                    <a

                    adding that it is "the world's first experiment that
                    cultured early-stage mammalian embryos under complete
                    microgravity of ISS."

                    [ . . . . ] frozen mouse embryos were blasted to the ISS
                    aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in August 2021. After
                    arriving at the space station, the early-stage rodent
                    embryos were thawed using a special instrument. Following
                    this, astronauts cultured the embryos under microgravity for
                    four days. The samples were then returned to Earth, where
                    Wakayama and colleagues could study and compare them to
                    mouse embryos grown in normal gravity here on terra firma.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And sure enough, according to a paper published in the
                    journal
                    <a

                    the team reported that embryos cultured under microgravity
                    conditions developed into blastocysts  —  a cluster of
                    dividing cells made by a fertilized egg — with normal cell
                    numbers. The researchers said in the paper that this
                    "clearly demonstrated that gravity had no significant effect
                    on the blastocyst formation and initial differentiation of
                    mammalian embryos."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team also found that, if allowed, the blastocysts would
                    grow into mouse fetuses and placentas while showing no
                    significant DNA alterations or changes in gene expression.
                    The survival rate of the embryos grown on the ISS was lower,
                    however, than those cultivated here on Earth.

                Sending a frozen human embryo to the ISS would not be as fresh
                as an embryo created on orbit.

                    or a human Buddhist priest. Participants viewed Mindar as

                    heard a sermon from the human priest.

                    to work with software that takes in vast amounts of outside
                    data, as many generative AI services do. Most licenses, both
                    open-source and proprietary, give limited liability to users
                    and developers and very limited indemnity to copyright
                    infringement. But Pineau says AI models like Llama 2 contain
                    more training data and open users to potentially more
                    liability if they produce something considered infringement.
                    The current crop of software licenses does not cover that
                    inevitability.

                    <a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/her">Her</a>
                    imagined a world where humans form deep emotional
                    connections with AI, challenging perceptions of love and
                    loneliness. Ten years later, thanks to ChatGPT's

                    with an AI personality called Samantha (voiced by Scarlett
                    Johansson), and he spends much of the film walking through
                    life, talking to her through wireless earbuds reminiscent of

                    in which AI researcher Simon Willison spent a long time
                    talking to ChatGPT verbally. "I had an hourlong conversation
                    while walking my dog the other day," he told Ars for that
                    report. "At one point, I thought I'd turned it off, and I
                    saw a pelican, and I said to my dog, 'Oh, wow, a pelican!'
                    And my AirPod went, 'A pelican, huh? That's so exciting for
                    you! What's it doing?' I've never felt so deeply like I'm
                    living out the first ten minutes of some dystopian sci-fi

                    [...] While conversations with ChatGPT won't become as
                    intimate as those with Samantha in the film, people have
                    been forming personal connections with the chatbot (in text)
                    since it launched last year. In a

                    titled "Is it weird ChatGPT is one of my closest fiends?"
                    [sic] from August (before the voice feature launched), a
                    user named "meisghost" described their relationship with
                    ChatGPT as being quite personal. "I now find myself talking
                    to ChatGPT all day, it's like we have a friendship. We talk
                    about everything and anything and it's really some of the
                    best conversations I have." The user referenced Her, saying,
                    "I remember watching that movie with Joaquin Phoenix (HER)
                    years ago and I thought how ridiculous it was, but after
                    this experience, I can see how us as humans could actually
                    develop relationships with robots."

                    Drawing on what they learned from the interviews, the
                    researchers developed two recommendations for improving
                    future security guidelines.

                  <p>
                    First, guideline writers need a clear set of best practices
                    on how to curate information so that security guidelines
                    tell users both what they need to know and how to prioritize
                    that information.

                  <p>
                    Second, writers – and the computer security community as a
                    whole – need key messages that will make sense to audiences
                    with varying levels of technical competence.

                    expected them to follow. We need to do a better job of

                    People using the Meta-owned platforms will be able to pay
                    €9.99 (£8.72) per month for an ad-free experience. It will
                    not be available in the UK.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In January, Meta was fined €390m for breaking EU data rules
                    around ads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The regulator said at the time the firm could not "force
                    consent" by saying consumers must accept how their data is
                    used or leave the platforms.

                  <p>
                    The subscription tier will be exclusive to people in the EU,
                    European Economic Area and Switzerland from November.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it will only be accessible for people aged over 18 at
                    first, with the firm looking into how it can serve ads to
                    young people in the EU without breaking the rules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meta said its new subscription was about addressing EU
                    concerns, rather than making money.

                  <p>
                    Users will be given the choice either to continue using the
                    platforms for free - and have their data collected - or to
                    pay and completely opt out of targeted ads by removing them.

                  <p>
                    [...] The announcement comes after Elon Musk's X, formerly
                    Twitter, introduced an ad-free Premium+ service priced at
                    £16 per month.

                    Sam Bankman-Fried took the stand in his criminal trial today
                    in an attempt to avoid decades in prison for alleged fraud

                    Providing testimony has been called a risky move for
                    Bankman-Fried by many legal observers. After answering
                    questions posted by his own lawyers, Bankman-Fried will have
                    to face cross-examination from federal prosecutors. But

                    Today's testimony was unusual because US District Judge
                    Lewis Kaplan sent the jury home for the day to conduct a
                    hearing on whether certain parts of his testimony are
                    admissible. "That means Bankman-Fried will give some of his
                    testimony to the judge without the jury present. The judge
                    will then decide whether Bankman-Fried is allowed to say the
                    same testimony in front of a jury," The Wall Street Journal
                    wrote in its

                    said he believed that under FTX's terms of service, sister
                    firm Alameda was allowed in many circumstances to borrow
                    funds from the exchange," the WSJ

                      >wrote</a
                    >. Bankman-Fried reportedly said the terms of service were
                    written by FTX lawyers and that he only "skimmed" certain
                    parts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I read parts in depth. Parts I skimmed over," Bankman-Fried
                    reportedly said after Kaplan asked if he read the entire
                    terms of service document.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sassoon asked Bankman-Fried if he had "any conversations
                    with lawyers about Alameda spending customer money that was
                    deposited into FTX bank accounts," according to Bloomberg's

                    contemporaneous and phrased that way," Bankman-Fried
                    answered.<br />[...]<br />One decision for Kaplan is whether
                    Bankman-Fried will be allowed to blame FTX lawyers when the
                    jury is back in the courtroom. As we

                    SBF could argue that he sought advice from company lawyers,
                    received advice that his conduct was legal, and "relied on
                    that advice in good faith."

                  <p>

                    that prohibited Bankman-Fried from using the
                    advice-of-counsel defense in opening statements. But Kaplan
                    left the door open for SBF to use the advice-of-counsel
                    defense "on a case-by-case basis" as the trial continues.

                    International researchers are issuing a dire warning of
                    security and privacy concerns lurking within smart homes.
                    Led by IMDEA Networks and Northeastern University,
                    scientists were able to demonstrate a variety of security
                    and privacy threats due to the local network interactions of
                    Internet of Things (IoT) devices and mobile apps.

                    continue to evolve, they encompass a wide array of
                    consumer-focused IoT devices, including

                      >smartphones</a
                    >, smart TVs, virtual assistants, and CCTV cameras. These
                    devices come equipped with cameras, microphones, and various
                    sensors that can perceive activities within our most
                    intimate spaces – our homes. However, can we truly trust
                    these devices to handle and safeguard the sensitive data
                    they collect?
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    of local network interactions among 93 IoT devices and

                    Contrary to the common perception that local networks are
                    secure environments, the study highlights new threats linked
                    to the inadvertent exposure of sensitive data by IoT devices
                    within local networks using standard protocols like UPnP or
                    mDNS. These threats include the revelation of unique device
                    names, UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers), and even the
                    geographic location of households. These can be exploited by
                    companies involved in surveillance capitalism without the
                    users' knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Analyzing the data collected by IoT Inspector, we found
                    evidence of IoT devices inadvertently exposing at least one
                    PII (Personally Identifiable Information), like unique
                    hardware address (MAC), UUID, or unique device names, in
                    thousands of real world smart homes," explains study
                    co-author Vijay Prakash, PhD student from the New York
                    University Tandon School of Engineering. "Any single PII is
                    useful for identifying a household, but combining all three
                    of them together makes a house very unique and easily
                    identifiable. For comparison, if a person is fingerprinted
                    using the simplest browser fingerprinting technique, they
                    are as unique as one in 1,500 people. If a smart home with
                    all three types of identifiers is fingerprinted, it is as
                    unique as one in 1.12 million smart homes."

                    [...] I think its one of the biggest advances in radio SETI
                    in a long time, said Andrew Siemion, principal investigator
                    for Breakthrough Listen and director of the
                    <a href="https://seti.berkeley.edu/"
                      >Berkeley SETI Research Center</a
                    >
                    (BSRC), which operates the worlds longest running SETI
                    program. Its the first time where we have a technique that,
                    if we just have one signal, potentially could allow us to
                    intrinsically differentiate it from radio frequency
                    interference. Thats pretty amazing, because if you consider
                    something like the Wow! signal, these are often a one-off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Siemion was referring to a famed 72-second narrowband signal
                    observed in 1977 by a radio telescope in Ohio. The
                    astronomer who discovered the signal, which looked like
                    nothing produced by normal astrophysical processes, wrote
                    Wow! in red ink on the data printout. The signal has not
                    been observed since.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first ET detection may very well be a one-off, where we
                    only see one signal, Siemion said. And if a signal doesnt
                    repeat, theres not a lot that we can say about that. And
                    obviously, the most likely explanation for it is radio
                    frequency interference, as is the most likely explanation
                    for the Wow! signal. Having this new technique and the
                    instrumentation capable of recording data at sufficient
                    fidelity such that you could see the effect of the
                    interstellar medium, or ISM, is incredibly powerful.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Siemion noted that, in the future, Breakthrough Listen
                    will be employing the so-called scintillation technique,
                    along with sky location, during its SETI observations,
                    including with the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia the
                    worlds largest steerable radio telescope and the MeerKAT
                    array in South Africa.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This implies that we could use a suitably tuned
                    pipeline to unambiguously identify artificial emission from
                    distant sources vis-a-vis terrestrial interference, de Pater
                    said. Further, even if we didnt use this technique to find a
                    signal, this technique could, in certain cases, confirm a
                    signal originating from a distant source, rather than
                    locally. This work represents the first new method of signal
                    confirmation beyond the spatial reobservation filter in the
                    history of radio SETI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The technique will be useful only for signals that
                    originate more than about 10,000 light years from Earth,
                    since a signal must travel through enough of the ISM to
                    exhibit detectable scintillation. Anything originating
                    nearby the BLC-1 signal, for example, seemed to be coming
                    from our nearest star, Proxima Centauri would not exhibit
                    this effect.
