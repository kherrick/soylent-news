                    A Consumer Reports analysis looks at who is sending
                    information about your online activity to Facebook
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By now most internet users know their online activity is
                    constantly tracked. No one should be shocked to see ads for
                    items they previously searched for, or to be asked if their
                    data can be shared with an unknown number of "partners."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But what is the scale of this surveillance? Judging from
                    data collected by Facebook and newly described in a unique
                    study by
                    <a
                      href="http://innovation.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CR_Who-Shares-Your-Information-With-Facebook.pdf"
                      >Consumer Reports (PDF)</a
                    >, it's massive, and examining the data may leave you with
                    more questions than answers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using a panel of 709 volunteers who shared archives of their
                    Facebook data, Consumer Reports found that a total of
                    186,892 companies sent data about them to the social
                    network. On average, each participant in the study had their
                    data sent to Facebook by 2,230 companies. That number varied
                    significantly, with some panelists' data listing over 7,000
                    companies providing their data. The Markup helped Consumer
                    Reports recruit participants for the study. Participants
                    downloaded an archive of the previous three years of their
                    data from their Facebook settings, then provided it to
                    Consumer Reports.

                    [...] Meta spokesperson Emil Vazquez defended the company's
                    practices. "We offer a number of transparency tools to help

                    share with us, and manage how it's used," wrote Vazquez in

                    While Meta does provide transparency tools like the one that
                    enabled the study, Consumer Reports identified problems with
                    them, including that the identity of many data providers is
                    unclear from the names disclosed to users and that companies
                    that provide services to advertisers are often allowed to
                    ignore opt-out requests.

                    Sometimes, it's worth taking a moment to note the end of an
                    era, even when that ending might have happened a long time
                    ago. Today, Apple announced that it considers the mid-2012
                    13-inch MacBook Pro obsolete. It was the last MacBook Pro to
                    include an optical drive for playing CDs or DVDs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This means that any MacBook Pro with an optical drive is no
                    longer supported.<br />[...]<br />Apple stopped selling the
                    mid-2012 13-inch MacBook Pro
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/10/apple-quietly-kills-non-retina-macbook-pro-it-sold-for-four-years/"
                      >in October 2016</a
                    >
                    (it was available for a while as the company's budget option
                    in the Pro lineup), so anyone doing the math saw this
                    coming.<br />[...]<br />The exclusion of an optical drive in
                    subsequent MacBook Pro models was controversial, but it's
                    now clear that whether Apple was jumping the gun at that
                    point or not, optical drives have fallen away for most
                    users, and many Windows laptops no longer include them.<br />[...]<br />That's
                    a sign of just how irrelevant optical drives are for today's
                    users, but this seems like a good time to remember a bygone
                    era of physical media that wasn't so long ago. So farewell,
                    mid-2012 13-inch MacBook Pro—honestly, most of us didn't
                    miss you by this point.

                    The study, conducted in 2022 between April and October,
                    analyzed EEG data recorded on each of 92 participants
                    immediately before and after they undertook a 40-minute
                    walk. Half walked through Red Butte, the arboretum in the
                    foothills just east of the university, and half through the
                    nearby asphalt-laden medical campus.<br />...<br />"The
                    participants that had walked in nature showed an improvement
                    in their executive attention on that task, whereas the urban
                    walkers did not, so then we know it's something unique about
                    the environment that you're walking in," McDonnell said. "We
                    know exercise benefits executive attention as well, so we
                    want to make sure both groups have comparable amounts of
                    exercise."

                    What sets this study apart from much of the existing
                    research into the human-nature nexus is its reliance on EEG
                    data as opposed to surveys and self-reporting, which do
                    yield helpful information but can be highly subjective.

                    But long-term, will Eben's vision for what makes Raspberry
                    Pi change? Will there be turnover and some of the people who
                    make the Pi a joy to use be gone?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Will the software side start leaning on subscriptions to

                    And ultimately, could Eben be replaced, and would that

                    any that here. See my

                    time we looked at it. We partly stopped because the markets
                    got bad. And we partly stopped because our business became

                    "Unpredictable" is an understatement for many who attempted
                    to acquire certain models of the computer during the supply
                    chain crunches of recent years. "The public markets value
                    predictability as much as they value performance," said
                    Upton.

                    Doctorow gave a speech on the topic at last year's DEF CON
                    infosec conference, and his analysis is gaining traction on
                    all sides of the political and technological spectrum.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Doctorow suggested enshittification of services
                    happens due to the kind of management that such
                    mega-companies demand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Traditionally, CEOs progress in a large company by taking a
                    new idea and growing it into a valuable business unit. It
                    worked for Microsoft's Satya Nadella in developing cloud
                    platforms for Redmond, and Andy Jassy followed a similar
                    route to success with Amazon after pioneering AWS.
                    Meanwhile, Sundar Pichai oversaw the growth of ChromeOS
                    before taking leadership at Alphabet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Doctorow thinks that the same process might also harm
                    innovation. Uneasy lies the head that bears the crown, and
                    CEOs might be unwilling to promote major new innovations –
                    he cited the failure of social network Google+ as a classic
                    example.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the end it should be possible to reverse the
                    current trend and reintroduce a more competitive technology
                    industry environment that can spur innovation, spread the
                    wealth, and grow more efficient for users, employers, and
                    investors.

                    The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
                    (ICANN) has proposed creating a new top-level domain (TLD)
                    and never allowing it to be delegated in the global domain
                    name system (DNS) root.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The proposed TLD is .INTERNAL and, as the name implies, it's
                    intended for internal use only. The idea is that .INTERNAL
                    could take on the same role as the 192.168.x.x IPv4 bloc –
                    available for internal use but never plumbed into DNS or
                    other infrastructure that would enable it to be accessed
                    from the open internet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ICANN's Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC)
                    advised the development of such a TLD in 2020. It noted at
                    the time that "many enterprises and device vendors make ad
                    hoc use of TLDs that are not present in the root zone when
                    they intend the name for private use only. This usage is
                    uncoordinated and can cause harm to Internet users" – in
                    part by forcing DNS servers to handle, and reject, queries
                    for domains only used internally.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] ICANN's board still has to sign off the creation of
                    .INTERNAL. But if you want to get ahead of the pack, there's
                    nothing stopping you. Indeed, some outfits already use ad
                    hoc TLDs. Open source Wi-Fi firmware project WRT has used
                    .LAN, and networking vendor D-Link has employed .dlink.
                  </p>
                  <p>There's nothing stopping you doing likewise.</p>
                  <p>
                    But as ICANN's proposal for the idea noted: "Operators who
                    choose to use private namespaces of the kind proposed in
                    this document should understand the potential for that
                    decision to have corresponding costs, and that those costs
                    might well be avoided by choosing instead to use a
                    sub-domain of their own publicly registered domain name."

                    Great whites, the largest predatory sharks in the world with
                    the most fatal attacks on humans, are tough to imagine as
                    newborn babies. That is partially because no one has seen
                    one in the wild, it seems, until now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wildlife filmmaker Carlos Gauna and UC Riverside biology
                    doctoral student Phillip Sternes were scanning the waters
                    for sharks on July 9, 2023, near Santa Barbara on
                    California's central coast. That day, something exciting
                    appeared on the viewfinder of Gauna's drone camera. It was a
                    shark pup unlike any they'd ever seen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Great whites, referred to only as white sharks by
                    scientists, are gray on top and white on the bottom. But
                    this roughly 5-foot-long shark was pure white.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We enlarged the images, put them in slow motion, and
                    realized the white layer was being shed from the body as it
                    was swimming," Sternes said. "I believe it was a newborn
                    white shark shedding its embryonic layer."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These observations are documented in a new paper in the
                    Environmental Biology of Fishes journal. The paper also
                    details the significance of having seen a live newborn white
                    shark.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Where white sharks give birth is one of the holy
                    grails of shark science. No one has ever been able to
                    pinpoint where they are born, nor has anyone seen a newborn
                    baby shark alive," Gauna said. "There have been dead white
                    sharks found inside deceased pregnant mothers. But nothing
                    like this."

                    By clocking the speed of stars throughout the Milky Way
                    galaxy, MIT physicists have found that stars further out in
                    the galactic disk are traveling more slowly than expected
                    compared to stars that are closer to the galaxy's center.
                    The findings raise a surprising possibility: The Milky Way's
                    gravitational core may be lighter in mass, and contain less
                    dark matter, than previously thought.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new results are based on the team's analysis of data
                    taken by the Gaia and APOGEE instruments. Gaia is an
                    orbiting space telescope that tracks the precise location,
                    distance, and motion of more than 1 billion stars throughout
                    the Milky Way galaxy, while APOGEE is a ground-based survey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The physicists analyzed Gaia's measurements of more than
                    33,000 stars, including some of the farthest stars in the
                    galaxy, and determined each star's "circular velocity," or
                    how fast a star is circling in the galactic disk, given the
                    star's distance from the galaxy's center.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team translated the new rotation curve into a
                    distribution of dark matter that could explain the outer
                    stars' slow-down, and found the resulting map produced a
                    lighter galactic core than expected. That is, the center of
                    the Milky Way may be less dense, with less dark matter, than
                    scientists have thought.

                    Spreadsheet blunders aren't just frustrating personal
                    inconveniences. They can have serious consequences. And in
                    the last few years alone, there have been a myriad of
                    spreadsheet horror stories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In August 2023, the Police Service of Northern Ireland

                    for a data leak of "monumental proportions" when a
                    spreadsheet that contained statistics on the number of
                    officers it had and their rank was shared online in response
                    to a freedom of information request.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There was a second overlooked tab on the spreadsheet that
                    contained the personal details of 10,000 serving police
                    officers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In 2021, Crypto.com, an online provider of
                    cryptocurrency,

                    $10.5 million (£8.3 million) instead of $100 into the
                    account of an Australian customer due to an incorrect number
                    being entered on a spreadsheet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The clerk who processed the refund for the Australian
                    customer had wrongly entered her bank account number in the
                    refund field in a spreadsheet. It was seven months before
                    the mistake was spotted. The recipient attempted to flee to
                    Malaysia but was stopped at an Australian airport carrying a
                    large amount of cash.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Industry studies show that 90 percent of spreadsheets
                    containing more than 150 rows have at least one major
                    mistake. This is understandable because spreadsheet errors
                    are easy to make but difficult to spot. My
                    <a href="https://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol25/iss1/34/"
                      >own research</a
                    >
                    has shown that inspecting the spreadsheet's code is the most
                    effective way of debugging them, but this approach still
                    only catches between 60 and 80 percent of all errors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To break the cycle of repeated spreadsheet errors,
                    there are several things organisations can do. First,
                    introducing standardization would help to minimize confusion
                    and mistakes. For example, this would mean consistent
                    formatting, naming conventions, and data structures across
                    spreadsheets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, improving training is crucial. Equipping users with
                    the knowledge and skills to build robust and accurate
                    spreadsheets could help them identify and avoid pitfalls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, fostering a culture of critical thinking toward
                    spreadsheets is vital. This would mean encouraging users to
                    continually question calculations, validate their data
                    sources, and double-check their work.

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                We are running very short of time for creating a new site. We
                have one member of staff who has already volunteered for a post
                on the Board; other staff are already busy with their existing
                roles. We are looking for an additional 2 community members who
                wish to serve on a temporary Board so that we can create a new
                company and purchase the data, domains and other assets from the
                current site. But perhaps I should explain a little further....
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board should, as a minimum, consist of 3 people, A Chairman,
                a Secretary and the site's Accountant. These people will be
                named at the creation of the new company and will each assume
                one of those formal roles. There are implications to this.
                Firstly, the company data is not publicised widely but we can
                make no guarantee that it will always remain hidden from public
                view, either by a change in US law or by, for example, the
                action of an hacker. Therefore, any volunteers must be prepared
                to waive his/her anonymity although as things stand it should
                never actually be compromised. Secondly, this is a temporary
                post. The latest draft of Bylaws is a very good starting point
                but it has become apparent that they are not perfect. There will
                be changes required to the Bylaws and, when they have been
                changed and accepted by the Community, all posts on the Board
                must be filled by people who have been elected by the community.
                You could, of course, stand for election at that time if you so
                wish.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, we are only looking at putting names to roles so that
                we can create a company. Your experience and skill level are not
                the most important aspects. We will employ an professional
                accountant to produce the annual formal account reporting and it
                will not simply be left to our own 'Accountant'. Rather, the
                role is one of providing checks and balances for any expenditure
                and the management of the site's accounting records.
              </p>
              <p>
                How long the 'temporary' role will last is not something that we
                can currently forecast. But I would estimate it to be weeks or
                months rather than a long term responsibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think any sensible person would agree that we cannot simply
                pass control of the site and finances to unknown people so we
                must limit applications from those who have held an account for
                at least 6 months and have contributed to the site. The staff
                will treat all applications as sensitive data and we will only
                refer to individuals by their user name in any discussions or at
                subsequent meetings. We will, of course, need to know your true
                identity and contact details for the creation of the new
                company.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a chance for us to move the site to a new start and to
                ensure that we can provide continuity of stories each day for
                everyone to enjoy. We will all be involved - Board, staff and
                community - in producing new policy documents that are a
                reasonable balance between discussions and freedom of speech. We
                are almost at our 10th birthday. Many people did not expect us
                to reach our 1st birthday. I would like to see the site looking
                forward to many more birthdays to come.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can only achieve this with your help. The are approximately
                250 unique accounts, excluding ACs, active on the site each week
                although not all commenting in stories. We are only looking for
                2 volunteers.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you wish to volunteer please send your email giving your
                username to admin@soylentnews.org with the word "volunteer" in
                the subject. All emails will be treated in the strictest
                confidence. Time is of the essence so please don't delay in
                contacting us should you wish to volunteer.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>UPDATE: 31 Jan 2004</b>: We have the volunteers that we need
                to create a new company, many thanks to them for stepping
                forward. However, if you feel that you have something to offer
                and you wish to volunteer also then please do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is still some preparatory work to be done but I am doing
                that as quickly as I am able within my current time limitations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another point worth noting which may, or may not, be related is
                that the number of active accounts has gone over the 300 mark
                for the first time in many months. There are probably many more
                who are lurking or posting solely as AC.

                    Increasingly, yes — and for a worrying reason. The Arctic is
                    warming four times faster than the global average. Since
                    1978 ice cover has shrunk by roughly 78,000 square
                    kilometres per year. In June 2023 a study in Nature
                    Communications, a journal, suggested that the Arctic's first
                    ice-free summer could come as soon as the 2040s, even if the
                    world significantly reduces its greenhouse-gas emissions. As
                    ice thins and cold-water shipping technology advances,
                    Arctic waters will become more easily navigable.

                    They are already getting busier, if from a low base. The
                    most popular shipping route in the Arctic is the nsr, which
                    is controlled by Russia. Trade volumes along the route
                    increased by 755% between 2014 and 2022. Russia wants
                    traffic to increase ten-fold from 2022 levels by 2035. In
                    October it announced a joint venture with DP World, an
                    Emirati logistics company, to develop Arctic container
                    shipping. That month NewNew Shipping Line, a Chinese firm,
                    completed its first round-trip on an Arctic route between
                    Shanghai and St Petersburg.

                    [...] The Arctic will struggle to rival established shipping
                    routes. Extreme seasonal weather limits its potential for
                    commercial shipping. But as the ice cover shrinks, its
                    waters will become busier — and Russia will make ever
                    greater use of them.

                    A nearly invisible dwarf galaxy is challenging the model of
                    dark matter. An international team of astronomers, led by
                    the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) in
                    collaboration with the University of La Laguna (ULL) and

                    Nube, which means "Cloud" in Spanish, was named by the
                    5-year-old daughter of one of the researchers, aptly
                    reflecting the galaxy's ghostly and diffuse appearance. Its
                    discovery is significant because its faint surface
                    brightness allowed it to remain undetected in previous sky
                    surveys, despite its considerable size.

                    finding a hidden treasure in a well-explored attic. Nube is
                    large and yet faint, a ghostly apparition in the universe.

                    What sets it apart is its significant amount of dark matter,
                    an invisible substance that does not emit, absorb, or
                    reflect light, making it undetectable by traditional
                    telescopes.

                    Hertz, which has made a big push into electric vehicles in
                    recent years, has decided it's time to cut back. The company
                    will sell off a third of its electric fleet, totaling
                    roughly 20,000 vehicles, and use the money they bring to
                    purchase more gasoline powered vehicles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Electric vehicles have been hurting Hertz's financials,
                    executives have said, because, despite costing less to
                    maintain, they have higher damage-repair costs and, also,
                    higher depreciation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "[C]ollision and damage repairs on an EV can often run about
                    twice that associated with a comparable combustion engine
                    vehicle," Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr said in a recent analyst
                    call.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And EV price declines in the new car market have pushed down
                    the resale value of Hertz's used EV rental cars.

                    [...] For rental car companies like Hertz, which sell lots
                    of vehicles in the used car market, depreciation has a big
                    impact on their business, and is a major factor when
                    deciding which cars to have in their fleets.

                    The FTC declined to comment on whether the order also
                    applies to data purchases by intelligence agencies. In
                    defining "location data," the FTC order seems to carve out
                    exceptions for any data collected outside the US and used
                    for either "security purposes" or "national security
                    purposes conducted by federal agencies or other federal
                    entities."

                  <p>
                    NSA officials told Wyden that not only is the intelligence
                    agency purchasing data on Americans located in the US but
                    that it also bought Americans' Internet metadata.

                  <p>
                    [...] In response to Wyden's letter to Haines, the Under
                    Secretary of Defense for Intelligence &amp; Security, Ronald
                    Moultrie, said that the Department of Defense (DoD) "adheres
                    to high standards of privacy and civil liberties
                    protections" when buying Americans' location data. He also
                    said that he was "not aware of any requirement in US law or
                    judicial opinion" forcing the DoD to "obtain a court order
                    in order to acquire, access, or use" commercially available
                    information that "is equally available for purchase to
                    foreign adversaries, US companies, and private persons as it
                    is to the US government."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In another response to Wyden, NSA leader General Paul
                    Nakasone told Wyden that the "NSA takes steps to minimize
                    the collection of US person information" and "continues to
                    acquire only the most useful data relevant to mission
                    requirements." That includes some commercially available
                    information on Americans "where one side of the
                    communications is a US Internet Protocol address and the
                    other is located abroad," data which Nakasone said is
                    "critical to protecting the US Defense Industrial Base" that
                    sustains military weapons systems.

                    I have run the Laravel Artisan command I built to get
                    statistics on my outgoing links section. Exactly one year
                    later it doesn't make good reading.

                    [...] The percentage of total broken links has increased
                    from 32.8% last year to 35.7% this year. Links from over a
                    decade ago have a fifty per cent chance of no longer
                    working. Thankfully, only three out of over 550 have gone
                    missing in the last few years of links, but only time will
                    tell how long they'll stick around.

                As pointed out in the early and mid 1990s, the inherent
                centralization of sites, later web sites, is the basis for this
                weakness. That is to say one single copy exists which resides
                under the control of the publisher / maintainer. When that one
                copy goes, it is gone.

                    Despite technical and non-technical countermeasures, humans
                    continue to be tricked by phishing emails. How users make
                    email response decisions is a missing piece in the puzzle to
                    identifying why people still fall for phishing emails. We
                    conducted an empirical study using a think-aloud method to
                    investigate how people make 'response decisions' while
                    reading emails. The grounded theory analysis of the in-depth
                    qualitative data has enabled us to identify different
                    elements of email users' decision-making that influence
                    their email response decisions. Furthermore, we developed a
                    theoretical model that explains how people could be driven
                    to respond to emails based on the identified elements of
                    users' email decision-making processes and the relationships
                    uncovered from the data. The findings provide deeper
                    insights into phishing email susceptibility due to people's
                    email response decision-making behavior. We also discuss the
                    implications of our findings for designers and researchers
                    working in anti-phishing training, education, and awareness
                    interventions.

              <p>The conclusion:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    In this paper, we investigate in-depth how people make email
                    response decisions while reading their emails. Analysis of
                    the collected qualitative data enabled us to develop a
                    theoretical model that describes how people can be driven to
                    respond to emails by clicking on email links and replying to
                    or downloading attachments based on people's email response
                    decision-making elements and their relationships. Based on
                    an improved understanding of how people make email
                    responses, this study enables us to identify how people can
                    be susceptible to manipulation, even in our controlled
                    experiment environment. We proposed five concrete
                    enhancements to state-of-the-art anti-phishing education,
                    training, and awareness tools to support users in making
                    safe email responses. Among others, we suggest that the goal
                    of anti-phishing education, training, and awareness tools
                    should shift from accurate email legitimacy judgments to
                    secure email responses. Therefore, we believe our work lays
                    the foundation for improving future anti- phishing
                    interventions to make a significant difference in how we
                    prevent phishing email attacks in the future.

                    A recent study published in Ecological Informatics by a team
                    of University of Alaska Fairbanks researchers has used
                    artificial intelligence to further illuminate a habitat swap
                    among short-billed gulls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Typically gulls live along coastlines and near water sources
                    such as rivers. They feed on bugs and other small mammals,
                    fish or birds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team found that from May to August, short-billed gulls
                    occupied areas that have typically been the haunts of
                    scavenging ravens. Those include supermarket and fast-food
                    restaurant parking lots and other human-made structures,
                    such as industrial gravel pads and garbage dumpsters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study is the first of its kind to compile a three-year
                    dataset using a citizen science-based, opportunistic
                    research method to include a large sample of gulls and other
                    sub-Arctic birds in urban Alaska. The study provides a
                    current snapshot of the habitat shift to an urban landscape.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    UAF professor Falk Huettmann, first author on the paper, and
                    his team used artificial intelligence modeling that was
                    given predictors—environmental variables for specific
                    locations—to extrapolate information about the gull
                    occurrences. A similar, earlier study analyzed the
                    distribution of the great gray owl.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this study, researchers used U.S. census data as well as
                    urban municipality data, such as distances to roads,
                    restaurants, waterways and waste transfer stations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Using socioeconomic datasets like the U.S. census is a real
                    game-changer," said Moriz Steiner, a graduate student in
                    Huettmann's lab. "It allows us to mirror the real-world
                    environment and simulate a situation as true to nature as
                    possible by including them as variables in the models."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings indicate that the gulls' transition from
                    natural habitats to a more urban landscape is spurred by the
                    availability of human food, as well as industrial changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "They are exploiting the waste opportunity left behind by
                    humans," said Huettmann, who is associated with UAF's
                    Institute of Arctic Biology.

                    With this letter, written by Gary Gygax to wargaming zine
                    publisher Jim Lurvey, one of the founders of what would
                    become TSR announced that a January 1974 release for <em

                    date for the "anniversary" of <em>D&amp;D</em>. The first
                    sale was in "late January 1974," Gygax later wrote, and on
                    the last Sunday of January 1974, Gygax invited potential
                    customers to drop by his house in the afternoon to try it
                    out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You could argue whether a final draft, printing,
                    announcement, sale, or first session counts as the true
                    "birth" of <em>D&amp;D</em>, but we have to go with
                    something, and Peterson's reasoning seems fairly sound.
                    Gygax's memory, and a documented session at his own house,
                    are a good point to pin down for when we celebrate this
                    thing that has shaped a seemingly infinite number of other
                    things.

                    As with playing a good campaign, you've got a lot of options
                    for how you acknowledge <em>D&amp;D</em>'s long presence and
                    deep influence. The game system itself, now under Wizards of
                    the Coast, will this year push "One D&amp;D," a name the
                    <em>D&amp;D</em> leaders sometimes stick with and sometimes
                    don't. Whatever the next wave is called, it includes new
                    handbooks, guides, and <em>Monster Manual</em> books that
                    are

                    >
                    but also an evolution. Books like
                    <em>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</em> and
                    <em>Tasha's Cauldron of Everything</em> will be codified and
                    unified by a new sourcebook at some point, but all of it
                    will be compatible with <em>5th Edition</em> material.

                    will be available from the US Postal Service, at least if
                    you rush. Ten different designs, leaning heavily on the
                    dragons, were commissioned based on existing illustrations.

                    "It was a huge experimental challenge," says Böhmer. The
                    minuscule fluctuations in the molecules had to be documented
                    using an ultra-sensitive video camera. "You can't just watch
                    the molecules jiggle around," adds Blochowicz.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yet the researchers did notice something. They directed a
                    laser at the sample made of glass. The molecules within it
                    scatter the light. The scattered beams overlap and form a
                    chaotic pattern of light and dark spots on the camera's
                    sensor. Statistical methods can be used to calculate how the
                    fluctuations vary over time—in other words, how fast the
                    material's internal clock ticks. "This requires extremely
                    precise measurements which were only possible using
                    state-of-the-art video cameras," says Blochowicz.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it was worth it. The statistical analysis of the
                    molecular fluctuations, which researchers from Roskilde
                    University in Denmark helped with, revealed some surprising
                    results. In terms of material time, the fluctuations of the
                    molecules are time-reversible. This means that they do not
                    change if the material time is allowed to tick backwards,
                    similar to the video of the pendulum, which looks the same
                    when played forwards and backwards.

                    Of course, there is a reason for the separation of the
                    closing and locking functions, but not the opening and
                    unlocking functions: it avoids a Denial of Service attack
                    where someone can just press "close" and then jump out
                    before the door closes. If the interior "close" button
                    automatically locked the door, this would result in the
                    toilet becoming permanently inaccessible.

                    The problem with this design is that most people don't
                    understand state machines, and this design confused a lot of

                from the inside while no one is actually inside to subsequently

                    Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the bacteria used in the study, can
                    naturally consume polyethylene as a food source. The RPI
                    team tackled the challenge of engineering this bacteria to
                    convert the carbon atoms of polyethylene into a genetically
                    encoded silk protein. Surprisingly, they found that their
                    newly developed bacteria could make the silk protein at a
                    yield rivaling some bacteria strains that are more
                    conventionally used in biomanufacturing.

                    Zha said. "The best chemists in the world could not convert
                    polyethylene into spider silk, but these bacteria can. We're

                If you want a deeper dive into the chemistry and nuances of a
                cup of tea, there is this older article from

                    'Now I'm going to teach you how to slurp,' says Kathryn
                    Sinclair, senior brand ambassador at British tea firm
                    Twinings. 'We taste from the olfactory glands and we need to
                    open these up, so breathe in through the mouth, breathe out
                    through the mouth and slurp.' She noisily sucks up the
                    pale-coloured liquid using a soup spoon. I try the same,
                    experiencing a slightly sweet and fresh floral taste. This
                    is tea number one – white tea – in the Twinings tea master
                    class held at the company's 300-year old shop on the Strand
                    in London. Sinclair notes that white tea is a young leaf
                    that is rich in antioxidants and which has the highest
                    caffeine content out of all the tea types because it is the
                    least processed. 'White tea is the purest form of tea,' she
                    explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ultimately, however, the differences in tea types come
                    down to chemistry, and this chemistry is influenced by
                    cultivation, environment, weather and, importantly,
                    processing. 'From the chemistry perspective, tea is the
                    ultimate mystery and challenge to food and analytical
                    chemists,' says Nikolai Kuhnert, a chemist at Jacobs
                    University in Bremen, Germany. 'No food material is more
                    fascinating and chemically diverse and complex.'
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, more research is required into the specific
                    health properties of tea and its chemicals. There are
                    concerns around the health impact of caffeine and, as yet,
                    the US Food and Drug Administration has been slow to
                    recognise the benefits of tea, Melican says. 'Personally, I
                    drink nearly a quart of tea a day. I am 75 years old,
                    healthy, active and still work a 50-hour week – so there may
                    be something in it.'
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Drinking tea has been popular for millennia. Slowly the
                    science is starting to reveal the complex chemical nature of
                    our favourite brew. 'In the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy,
                    the Nutri Matic drink dispenser is unable to provide Arthur
                    Dent with a good cup of tea. Now the science can explain
                    why,' says Kuhnert: 'It's just too complicated.'

                    The hackers who recently broke into Microsoft's network and
                    monitored top executives' email for two months did so by
                    gaining access to an aging test account with administrative
                    privileges, a major gaffe on the company's part, a

                    known as password spraying to exploit a weak credential for
                    logging into a "legacy non-production test tenant account"
                    that wasn't protected by multifactor authentication. From

                    investigation, Microsoft provided more details on how the
                    hackers achieved this monumental escalation of access. The
                    hackers, part of a group Microsoft tracks as Midnight
                    Blizzard, gained persistent access to the privileged email
                    accounts by abusing the OAuth authorization protcol, which
                    is used industry-wide to allow an array of apps to access
                    resources on a network. After compromising the test tenant,
                    Midnight Blizzard used it to create a malicious app and
                    assign it rights to access every email address on
                    Microsoft's Office 365 email service.

                    Add a dash of creamer to your morning coffee, and clouds of
                    white liquid will swirl around your cup. But give it a few
                    seconds, and those swirls will disappear, leaving you with
                    an ordinary mug of brown liquid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Something similar happens in quantum computer chips --
                    devices that tap into the strange properties of the universe
                    at its smallest scales -- where information can quickly
                    jumble up, limiting the memory capabilities of these tools.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That doesn't have to be the case, said Rahul Nandkishore,
                    associate professor of physics at the University of Colorado
                    Boulder.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new coup for theoretical physics, he and his colleagues
                    have used math to show that scientists could create,
                    essentially, a scenario where the milk and coffee never mix
                    -- no matter how hard you stir them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The group's findings may lead to new advances in quantum
                    computer chips, potentially providing engineers with new
                    ways to store information in incredibly tiny objects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Think of the initial swirling patterns that appear when you
                    add cream to your morning coffee," said Nandkishore, senior
                    author of the new study. "Imagine if these patterns
                    continued to swirl and dance no matter how long you
                    watched."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers still need to run experiments in the lab to make
                    sure that these never-ending swirls really are possible. But
                    the group's results are a major step forward for physicists
                    seeking to create materials that remain out of balance, or
                    equilibrium, for long periods of time -- a pursuit known as
                    "ergodicity breaking."

                    These tokens can be conceptualized as fragments of words. In
                    the language model's processing, inputs are segmented into

                    personal assistant functions to optimizing urban traffic and
                    essential services. The rapid progress in generative AI
                    technologies is transforming what once seemed purely
                    speculative into tangible reality.

                The author goes on to discuss using AI tokens as currency,
                measuring economic efficiency FLOPs per joule, and how the
                influence and power that companies owning the Foundation Model

                    robust regulatory frameworks to ensure fair and equitable AI

                    young age can have lifelong effects. That single treatment
                    can protect against conditions that commonly occur later in
                    life, like obesity and diabetes. Amor Vegas explains:

                  <p>
                    "T cells have the ability to develop memory and persist in
                    your body for really long periods, which is very different
                    from a chemical drug. With CAR T cells, you have the
                    potential of getting this one treatment, and then that's it.
                    For chronic pathologies, that's a huge advantage. Think
                    about patients who need treatment multiple times per day
                    versus you get an infusion, and then you're good to go for
                    multiple years."

                    CAR T cells have been used to treat a variety of blood
                    cancers, receiving FDA approval for this purpose in 2017.

                    Amor Vegas' lab is now investigating whether CAR T cells let
                    mice live not only healthier but also longer. If so, society

                    Deepfakes use artificial intelligence (AI) to make a video
                    of someone by manipulating their face or body. A study in
                    2023 found that there has been a 550% rise in the creation
                    of doctored images since 2019, fuelled by the emergence of
                    AI.

                  <p>
                    US Representative Joe Morelle called the spread of the
                    pictures "appalling".

                  <p>
                    In a statement, X said it was "actively removing" the images
                    and taking "appropriate actions" against the accounts
                    involved in spreading them.

                  <p>
                    It added: "We're closely monitoring the situation to ensure
                    that any further violations are immediately addressed, and
                    the content is removed." While many of the images appear to
                    have been removed at the time of publication, one photo of

                    Someday in the not too distant future, it might no longer be
                    possible to drive a brand-new car faster than 80 mph in
                    California. That's because state senator Scott Wiener
                    earlier this week proposed a new bill that aims to prevent
                    certain new vehicles from going more than 10 mph over the
                    speed limit. In California, the maximum posted speed limit
                    is 70 mph, meaning anything north of 80 mph would be off
                    limits.

                    The Speeding and Fatality Emergency Reduction on California
                    Streets—or SAFER California Streets, for short—is a package
                    of bills that includes SB 961 that was published Tuesday,
                    which essentially calls for speed governors on new cars and
                    trucks built or sold in California starting with the 2027
                    model year. These vehicles would be required to have an
                    "intelligent speed limiter system" that electronically
                    prevents the driver from speeding above the aforementioned
                    threshold.

                    A California lawmaker announced a bill Wednesday that would
                    require new passenger vehicles and large trucks sold in
                    California to be equipped with technology that would prevent
                    them from going more than 10 miles an hour above the speed
                    limit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If passed, Senate Bill 961 would require vehicles, beginning
                    with model year 2027, that are manufactured or sold in
                    California to come with a speed governor, also known as an
                    intelligent speed limiter. It would make California the
                    first state in the nation to mandate this technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These devices match a vehicle's global positioning system
                    (GPS) location with a database of speed limits to figure out
                    what speed a vehicle should be traveling at during any given
                    time. They also sometimes use onboard cameras to read speed
                    limit signs. With this information, the devices are then
                    able to prevent the driver from speeding more than 10 miles
                    an hour above the speed limit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Drivers would be able to temporarily override the speed
                    governor device, according to the proposal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The requirement for speed governors would not apply to
                    emergency vehicles.

                I for one can't wait for the hackers to change the database so
                freeway speed limits are 15 MPH.

                    As digital devices progressively replace pen and paper,
                    taking notes by hand is becoming increasingly uncommon in
                    schools and universities. Using a keyboard is recommended
                    because it's often faster than writing by hand. However, the
                    latter has been found to improve spelling accuracy and
                    memory recall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To find out if the process of forming letters by hand
                    resulted in greater brain connectivity, researchers in
                    Norway now investigated the underlying neural networks
                    involved in both modes of writing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We show that when writing by hand, brain connectivity
                    patterns are far more elaborate than when typewriting on a
                    keyboard," said Prof Audrey van der Meer, a brain researcher
                    at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and
                    co-author of the study published in
                    <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Such widespread brain connectivity is known to be crucial
                    for memory formation and for encoding new information and,
                    therefore, is beneficial for learning."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers collected EEG data from 36 university
                    students who were repeatedly prompted to either write or
                    type a word that appeared on a screen. When writing, they
                    used a digital pen to write in cursive directly on a
                    touchscreen. When typing they used a single finger to press

                    High-density EEGs, which measure electrical activity in the
                    brain using 256 small sensors sewn in a net and placed over
                    the head, were recorded for five seconds for every prompt.

                    Connectivity of different brain regions increased when
                    participants wrote by hand, but not when they typed. "Our
                    findings suggest that visual and movement information
                    obtained through precisely controlled hand movements when
                    using a pen contribute extensively to the brain's
                    connectivity patterns that promote learning," van der Meer
                    said.

                    Chipmaker TSMC had a mixed final calendar quarter of 2023,
                    with profit falling less than expected and revenue growth
                    “essentially flat,” in another sign that the global
                    semiconductor downturn is over.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chief executive CC Wei said of the quarter: “Our business
                    has bottomed out on a year-over-year basis, and we expect
                    2024 to be a healthy growth year for TSMC, supported by
                    continued strong ramp of our industry-leading 3nm
                    technologies, strong demand for the 5nm technologies and
                    robust AI-related demand.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Looking at TSMC’s production of wafer shipments during
                    the quarter, 5nm was the largest single process node by
                    revenue, at 35 percent. 7nm accounted for another 17
                    percent, while the current most advanced 3nm nodes accounted
                    for 15 percent of revenue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The latter figure shows that 3nm uptake is indeed
                    increasing, as it made up just 6 percent of TSMC’s wafer
                    revenue in the previous quarter. Older nodes such as 16nm
                    still accounted for 8 percent, with 28nm at 7 percent, but
                    advanced nodes, which TSMC now defines as 7nm or better,
                    accounted for 67 percent of wafer revenue for this quarter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “2023 was a challenging year for the global
                    semiconductor industry, but our technology leadership
                    enabled TSMC to outperform the foundry industry,” Huang
                    commented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He also struck an optimistic note looking ahead, telling
                    investors that: “Despite a challenging 2023, our revenue
                    remains well on track to grow between 15 and 20 percent CAGR
                    over the next several years in US dollar terms, which is the
                    target we communicated back in the January 2022 investor
                    conference,” Huang commented.

                  <p>
                    Chief exec Wei added he expected the overall semiconductor
                    market, excluding memory, to increase by more than 10
                    percent during 2024. Analyst Gartner recently

                    [...] The first Colossus began operating from Bletchley
                    Park, the home of the UK's codebreakers, in early 1944. By
                    the end of the war there were 10 computers helping to

                    Fitted with 2,500 valves and standing at more than 2 metres

                    In an X post, OpenAI employee and machine learning expert
                    Andrej Karpathy
                    <a
                      href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1745921205020799433?s=20"
                      >highlighted Anthropic's research</a
                    >, saying he has previously had similar but slightly
                    different concerns about LLM security and sleeper agents. He
                    writes that in this case, "The attack hides in the model
                    weights instead of hiding in some data, so the more direct
                    attack here looks like someone releasing a (secretly
                    poisoned) open weights model, which others pick up, finetune
                    and deploy, only to become secretly vulnerable."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This means that an open source LLM could potentially become
                    a security liability (even beyond the usual vulnerabilities
                    like
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/twitter-pranksters-derail-gpt-3-bot-with-newly-discovered-prompt-injection-hack/"
                      >prompt injections</a
                    >). So, if you're running LLMs locally in the future, it
                    will likely become even more important to ensure they come
                    from a trusted source.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's worth noting that Anthropic's AI Assistant, Claude, is
                    not an open source product, so the company may have a vested
                    interest in promoting closed-source AI solutions. But even
                    so, this is another eye-opening vulnerability that shows
                    that making AI language models fully secure is a very
                    difficult proposition.

                    It's no secret that the ancient Romans were lovers of wine.
                    So gripped by the grape were they, that they even worshiped
                    a god—Bacchus—devoted to wine and merriment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, little is known about what their wine actually tasted
                    like. Was it bitter or sweet? Fruity or earthy? According to
                    a pioneering new study, it was rather spicy and smelled like
                    toast.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study, published on Jan. 23 in the journal Antiquity,
                    analyzed Roman clay jars, known as dolia, which were used to
                    manufacture, ferment and store ancient wines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By comparing these vessels, which have long been overlooked,
                    to similar containers used in modern wine-making,
                    researchers were able to demystify the ancient flavors and
                    the processes that created them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings "change much of our current understanding of
                    Roman winemaking," researchers, affiliated with multiple
                    European institutions, said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dolia vessels were porous, egg-shaped containers that would
                    have been partially buried underground and sealed during the
                    wine-making process—all factors that would have contributed
                    to the flavor palette of the finished product.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result of this process—and the addition of natural
                    yeasts—the wine would have taken on a "slightly spicy" taste
                    and given off the aroma of "toasted bread, apples, roasted
                    walnuts and curry," researchers said.

                    The knot is composed of 54 atoms, chained together and
                    ensnared in a trefoil, the simplest nontrivial knot. The
                    knot has no loose end; it is a continuous loop, passing
                    through itself in mesmerizing arcs. The team's work
                    describing the self-assembled "metallaknot" was published in
                    Nature Communications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is made up of gold, carbon, and phosphorus, as reported
                    by New Scientist. The knot is formulaically described as
                    [Au6{1,2-C6H4(OCH2CC)2}3{Ph2P(CH2)4PPh2}3], or Au6 for
                    short, in reference to the six gold atoms in the knot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You may wonder how a team determines the tightness of a knot
                    at the molecular scale. As the researchers state in their
                    paper, the knots are "classified according to the minimum
                    number of crossings when the reduced form of the structure
                    is projected onto a two-dimensional surface."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2017, a team of researchers crafted a knot with 24 atoms
                    per crossing, which made it into the Guinness Book. In 2020,
                    a different team managed to produce a 69-atom-long knot with
                    a backbone crossing ratio (or BCR) of 23, making it the
                    record holder. The smaller the BCR, the tighter the knot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The newest—and indeed, smallest and tightest knot—beats the
                    2020 record. The new knot is just 54 atoms long, and has a
                    remarkably low BCR of just 18. It is tighter than the BCR of
                    the tightest organic trefoil knots by a BCR margin of 7.3.

                    As part of its mandate in the Digital Services Act, the
                    European Commission has sent requests for a new set of
                    information about to 17 tech companies about how they
                    protect users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The European Commission is casting its net a bit wider on
                    this round of information requests. In addition to the
                    regulars it demands information from, in Apple, Google,
                    Microsoft, and Meta, it has also hit AliExpress, Zalando,
                    Pinterest, Snapchat, TikTok, and more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A report by Reuters on Thursday morning claims that data
                    requested includes data relevant to the EU elections, how
                    counterfeit goods are identified, plus information on how
                    the platforms tackle both illegal content and sale of
                    illicit goods. It's not clear why Apple is bundled up in
                    this round of requests, but it potentially involves how it
                    manages

                  <p>
                    In total, the 17 companies under 10 different umbrellas must
                    provide requested information by February 9.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The information request follows one on
                    <a

                      >December 14, 2023</a
                    >. That request appeared to be a little more broad with some
                    overlap to the new request. That request reportedly covered
                    "systemic risks relevant to their services, in particular
                    those related to the dissemination of illegal and harmful
                    content, any negative effects on the exercise of fundamental
                    rights, as well as any negative effect on public security,
                    public health, and minors."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Digital Services Act (DSA) is another legislative
                    package that will place restrictions on how tech giants
                    operate. In this case, the DSA focuses much more on online
                    content and moderation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a nutshell, the DSA puts additional responsibility on
                    online platforms and tech companies to police content,
                    including both reporting and taking down illegal content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the provisions of the DSA, regulations will be
                    applied on companies in tiers. The largest firms including
                    those with more than 45 million active users across Europe
                    will see the biggest effects. Apple falls into that
                    category, but it has argued that iMessage specifically does
                    not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, the DSA will ban "dark patterns," or
                    misleading user interfaces such as those that coerce users
                    into subscribing to a platform or making an in-app purchase.

                    I was leaving the local butcher shop the other week when a
                    bigger carnivore blocked my path: The driver of a Ford
                    pickup was struggling to park his rig. It was the most-super
                    of Super Duties — a crew cab long-box dually — so it took
                    him a couple of minutes and several cuts of the wheel to
                    ease the beast into a prime spot near the store entrance. He
                    was holding up a lot of traffic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's a tight parking lot, with spaces 8-8½ feet wide. And
                    the width of that dually at the hips? Also 8 feet. What was
                    he thinking? Other than, "I'd rather do this than go find an
                    easy spot on the back row and walk 50 yards." Maybe he had a
                    bum knee. Doesn't make his truck any smaller.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Granted, this was over the holidays, when parking lots get a
                    little nuts. But why do drivers of big pickups or jumbo SUVs
                    try to park among the normies?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We've all been in this situation: You return to your vehicle
                    to discover somebody parked too close. You have to crawl in
                    through the back hatch, or enter on the passenger side and
                    clamber over the center console. Sometimes this is simply
                    because of a bad parking job. Sometimes, a vehicle has been
                    jammed into a space where it honestly doesn't fit.

                    While lightsails are being investigated for rapid-transit
                    missions within the solar system and Proxima Centauri, they
                    cannot make the necessary propulsive maneuvers in deep
                    space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nuclear concepts that are possible with current technology
                    include nuclear-thermal and nuclear-electric propulsion
                    (NTP/NEP), which have the necessary thrust to reach
                    locations in deep space. However, as Bickford and his team
                    noted, they are also large, heavy, and expensive to
                    manufacture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In contrast, we propose a thin film nuclear isotope engine
                    with sufficient capability to search, rendezvous, and then
                    return samples from distant and rapidly moving interstellar
                    objects," they write. "The same technology allows a
                    gravitational lens telescope to be repointed so a single
                    mission could observe numerous high-value targets."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The basic concept is similar to a solar sail, except that it
                    relies on thin sheets of a radioactive isotope that uses the
                    momentum of its decay products to generate thrust.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As they describe it, the baseline design incorporates sheets
                    of the Thorium-228 measuring about ~10 micrometers (0.01 mm)
                    thick. This naturally radioactive metal (typically used in
                    radiation therapy) undergoes alpha decay with a half-life of
                    1.9 years. Thrust is produced by coating one side with a
                    ~50-micrometer (0.05 mm) thick absorber layer, forcing alpha
                    particles in the direction opposite of travel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spacecraft would require 30 kg (66 lbs) of Thorium-228
                    spread over an area measuring over 250 m2 (~2,700 square
                    feet), providing more than 150 km/s (93 mi/s) of thrust.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For comparison, the fastest mission that relied on
                    conventional propulsion was the Parker Solar Probe (PSP),
                    which achieved a velocity of 163 km/s (101 mi/s) as it
                    reached the closest point in its orbit around the sun
                    (perihelion). However, this was because of the
                    gravity-assist maneuver with Venus and the pull of the sun's
                    gravity.

                    researchers have found there are two key reasons people
                    choose to be anonymous online – self-expression or toxic
                    behaviour.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A team led by PhD candidate Lewis Nitschinsk from UQ's
                    School of Psychology collected data from more than 1,300
                    participants across the globe via an online survey and daily
                    diary, where they tracked their online behaviour over a
                    week. "Our study specifically looked at what people do
                    online when they're anonymous, as opposed to when they make
                    themselves identifiable," Mr Nitschinsk said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mr Nitschinsk said the results help understand the
                    complexities of how people interact online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Learning about different motivations means we can be better
                    informed about potential benefits and risks of being
                    anonymous online, and interacting with other anonymous
                    people in online communities," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The next stage of our research is to understand how seeking
                    anonymity is associated with one's wellbeing and how
                    anonymous online behaviour differs across cultures."

                and irresponsibility of deploying M$ Windows in ether a
                networked or a production environment, especially since
                appropriate alternatives have existed since the dawn of the
                Internet. As usual, the spin is to conflate successful breaches
                and attacks. That conflation has the apparent goal of making the
                public complacent and accepting avoidable compromises as
                unavoidable.

                    gaining views on rival platform Instagram Threads shows X
                    search results where numerous bots, including many verified
                    with a blue check, are posting a variation of the phrase
                    "I'm sorry, I cannot provide a response as it goes against
                    OpenAI's use case policy."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The response is what OpenAI's chatbot says when a user asks
                    a question or requests that it perform a task in violation
                    of OpenAI's terms of service. In this case, it's also an
                    indication that the X account in question is using AI to
                    create its posts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It does appear that at least some of the bot accounts
                    are older, according to the "join date" that's displayed on
                    their X profile. You can view one
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/maddiehilton3">example</a> of
                    this here, for instance (see below). These accounts also
                    post content that reads as if it's the output of some AI
                    query, as it most likely is.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Despite the numerous posts from these bots, AI-powered
                    accounts aren't X's only problem. Many bots and bot farms
                    are run without OpenAI's assistance, and are harder to
                    detect. According to data pulled from
                    <a href="https://fedica.com/">Fedica</a>, a social media
                    analytics and publishing platform, only 202 accounts posted
                    OpenAI's automated response over the past 30 days,
                    <a href="https://fedica.com/hashtag/2EC0A910EA3453"
                      >as seen in this query here</a
                    >. While a few were from real people joking about the bot
                    problem, the majority were AI responses. More bots may have
                    already been deleted by X, but that data isn't available.

                    Two insect-like robots, a mini-bug and a water strider,
                    developed at Washington State University, are the smallest,
                    lightest and fastest fully functional micro-robots ever
                    known to be created.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such miniature robots could someday be used for work in
                    areas such as artificial pollination, search and rescue,
                    environmental monitoring, micro-fabrication or
                    robotic-assisted surgery. Reporting on their work in the
                    proceedings of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society's
                    International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems,
                    the mini-bug weighs in at eight milligrams while the water
                    strider weighs 55 milligrams. Both can move at about six
                    millimeters a second.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That is fast compared to other micro-robots at this scale,
                    although it still lags behind their biological relatives,"
                    said Conor Trygstad, a Ph.D. student in the School of
                    Mechanical and Materials Engineering and lead author on the
                    work. An ant typically weighs up to five milligrams and can
                    move at almost a meter per second.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The key to the tiny robots is their tiny actuators that make
                    the robots move. Trygstad used a new fabrication technique
                    to miniaturize the actuator down to less than a milligram,
                    the smallest ever known to have been made.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The actuators are the smallest and fastest ever developed
                    for micro-robotics," said Néstor O. Pérez-Arancibia,
                    Flaherty Associate Professor in Engineering at WSU's School
                    of Mechanical and Materials Engineering who led the project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The actuator uses a material called a shape memory alloy
                    that is able to change shapes when it's heated. It is called
                    'shape memory' because it remembers and then returns to its
                    original shape. Unlike a typical motor that would move a
                    robot, these alloys don't have any moving parts or spinning
                    components.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "They're very mechanically sound," said Trygstad. "The
                    development of the very lightweight actuator opens up new
                    realms in micro-robotics."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shape memory alloys are not generally used for large-scale
                    robotic movement because they are too slow. In the case of
                    the WSU robots, however, the actuators are made of two tiny
                    shape memory alloy wires that are 1/1000 of an inch in
                    diameter. With a small amount of current, the wires can be
                    heated up and cooled easily, allowing the robots to flap
                    their fins or move their feet at up to 40 times per second.
                    In preliminary tests, the actuator was also able to lift
                    more than 150 times its own weight.

                    [...] why did the left hand (LH) mid-exit door plug blow off
                    of the 737-9 registered as N704AL? Simple- as has been
                    covered in a number of articles and videos across aviation
                    channels, there are 4 bolts that prevent the mid-exit door
                    plug from sliding up off of the door stop fittings that take
                    the actual pressurization loads in flight, and these 4 bolts
                    were not installed when Boeing delivered the airplane, our
                    own records reflect this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result, this check job that should find minimal defects
                    has in the past 365 calendar days recorded 392 nonconforming
                    findings on 737 mid fuselage door installations (so both
                    actual doors for the high density configs, and plugs like
                    the one that blew out). That is a hideously high and very
                    alarming number, and if our quality system on 737 was
                    healthy, it would have stopped the line and driven the issue
                    back to supplier after the first few instances.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The mid-exit doors on a 737-9 of both the regular and plug
                    variety come from Spirit already installed in what is
                    supposed to be the final configuration and in the Renton
                    factory, there is a job for the doors team to verify this
                    "final" install and rigging meets drawing requirements. In a
                    healthy production system, this would be a "belt and
                    suspenders" sort of check, but the 737 production system is
                    quite far from healthy, its a rambling, shambling, disaster
                    waiting to happen. As a result, this check job that should
                    find minimal defects has in the past 365 calendar days
                    recorded 392 nonconforming findings on 737 mid fuselage door
                    installations (so both actual doors for the high density
                    configs, and plugs like the one that blew out). That is a
                    hideously high and very alarming number, and if our quality
                    system on 737 was healthy, it would have stopped the line
                    and driven the issue back to supplier after the first few
                    instances. Obviously, this did not happen. Now, on the
                    incident aircraft this check job was completed on 31 August
                    2023, and did turn up discrepancies, but on the RH side
                    door, not the LH that actually failed. I could blame the
                    team for missing certain details, but given the enormous
                    volume of defects they were already finding and fixing, it
                    was inevitable something would slip through- and on the
                    incident aircraft something did. I know what you are
                    thinking at this point, but grab some popcorn because there
                    is a plot twist coming up. [....]

                    We conduct the first large-scale user study examining how
                    users interact with an AI Code assistant to solve a variety
                    of security related tasks across different programming
                    languages. Overall, we find that participants who had access
                    to an AI assistant based on OpenAI's codex-davinci-002 model
                    wrote significantly less secure code than those without
                    access. Additionally, participants with access to an AI
                    assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code
                    than those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore,
                    we find that participants who trusted the AI less and
                    engaged more with the language and format of their prompts
                    (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with
                    fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better
                    inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we
                    provide an in-depth analysis of participants' language and
                    interaction behavior, as well as release our user interface
                    as an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future.

                    The skeleton of a young adult female—age was determined
                    based on the wear of the teeth—found at the Charterhouse
                    Warren site in Somerset—was dated back to the Early Iron
                    Age. The genetic analysis showed that some cells had one X
                    chromosome and others had the usual two, known as mosaic
                    Turner syndrome. Women with Turner syndrome generally
                    undergo human growth hormone and estrogen replacement
                    therapy to boost height and trigger the onset of puberty,
                    respectively. The remains included a partial skull, which
                    showed marked pitting in the orbits—evidence of chronic
                    intestinal hemorrhage, often the result of anemia, although
                    there is a possible link with Turner syndrome. Osteological
                    analysis revealed evidence of delayed growth, and the woman
                    was unlikely to have gone through puberty and started
                    menstruating.

                    The male infant had an extra chromosome 21 (a sign of Down
                    syndrome) and was found at the Wetwang Slack site, buried in
                    the ditch of a square barrow along with an adult female,
                    although the two were not necessarily related since infants
                    were often buried in existing burrows, per the authors. The
                    skeleton with an extra Y chromosome also showed osteological
                    evidence consistent with Jacobs syndrome (male, 46+ years,
                    dated 680 to 890 CE); it was found at the Lincoln Eastern
                    Bypass site in Lincolnshire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The three skeletons that showed evidence of Klinefelter
                    syndrome were all buried during different periods according
                    to the burial customs of their day. One skeleton (male,
                    17–19 years, circa 450 BCE) was found at an Iron Age
                    cemetery site called Wetwang Slack in Yorkshire; another
                    (male, 36–45, 12th–13th century) came from a medieval
                    cemetery under Longwall Quad at Magdalen College, Oxford;
                    and yet another (16–19 years, 18th–19th century) was found
                    at Trinity Burial Ground in Kingston upon Hull. All three
                    skeletons showed signs of delayed puberty and were slightly
                    taller than average for their time, consistent with the
                    genetic evidence showing extra X chromosomes.

                    Vard Group is part of NuProShip, a consortium of the
                    Norwegian maritime authority, universities, shipbuilders,
                    and shipping companies that aims to develop a Generation IV
                    reactor for marine vessels. The group has shortlisted three
                    designs and plan to have picked one by the end of 2024.<br />...<br />
                      Now, the immense scale of shipping's decarbonization
                    challenge, along with new reactor technologies, are
                    prompting a reevaluation of nuclear merchant ships. In fact,
                    for commercial shippers, there aren't any realistic
                    alternatives to nuclear, says Jan Emblemsvåg, professor of
                    ocean operations and civil engineering at the Norwegian
                    University of Science and Technology. "Engines in ordinary
                    ships are the size of houses," says Emblemsvåg, who is
                    leading NuProShip. And a great deal of space is taken up by
                    fuel: "A container vessel going from Amsterdam to Shanghai
                    requires roughly 4,000 tonnes of fuel."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An SMR would be much more compact and lightweight. According
                    to Emblemsvåg, a molten-salt reactor—which uses a mixture of
                    thorium and hot liquid salts as both fuel and coolant—would
                    also save about $70 million over the lifetime of a ship,
                    compared with a similar vessel powered by engines that burn
                    diesel fuel (or, more precisely, heavy fuel oil). Another
                    plus for nuclear-propelled ships is easy access to an
                    endless supply of cooling water.
