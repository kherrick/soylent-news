                    To mark the 40th anniversary of M.U.L.E., we are dedicating
                    this special write-up to the history of the game's
                    development, taking a look behind the scenes with reports
                    and new 2023 interviews with those involved. As well as to
                    all the original versions of the game, we introduce you to
                    the officially licensed remakes and the 'clones' that
                    excellent games inevitably spawn. Finally, we round off the
                    anniversary celebrations with a test of the brand new
                    M.U.L.E. Online.

                    trying to make it possible to beam solar energy from space.
                    In 2015, the nation made a breakthrough when JAXA scientists
                    successfully beamed 1.8 kilowatts of power, enough energy to
                    power an electric kettle,

                    ></a>
                    to a wireless receiver. Now, Japan is poised to bring the
                    technology one step closer to reality.

                  <p>
                    [...] The project, led by Naoki Shinohara, a Kyoto
                    University professor who has been working on space-based
                    solar energy since 2009, will attempt to deploy a series of
                    small satellites in orbit. Those will then try to beam the
                    solar energy the arrays collect to ground-based receiving
                    stations hundreds of miles away.
                  </p>

                    Using orbital solar panels and microwaves to send energy to
                    Earth was first proposed in 1968. Since then, a few
                    countries, including
                    <a
                      href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-18-china-solar-farm-power-station-space-2025.html"
                    ></a>
                    and the US, have spent time and money pursuing the idea. The
                    technology is appealing because orbital solar arrays
                    represent a potentially unlimited renewable energy supply.
                    In space, solar panels can collect energy no matter the time
                    of day, and by using microwaves to beam the power they
                    produce, clouds aren't a concern either. However, even if
                    Japan successfully deploys a set of orbital solar arrays,
                    the tech would still be closer to science fiction than fact.
                    That's because producing an array that can generate 1
                    gigawatt of power – or about the output of one nuclear
                    reactor – would cost about $7 billion with currently
                    available technologies.

                    [...] Tesla may not be able to rest on its laurels for long.
                    "Even for established brands like Tesla, winning the
                    confidence of consumers is vital," says Håkan Lutz, CEO and
                    founder of the EV mini-mobility company Luvly. "Continued
                    safety failings and production delays are leading customers
                    to question whether self-driving vehicles will ever be a
                    reality, and delays to the Cybertruck—announced four years
                    ago—are not doing the company any favors in instilling
                    confidence."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Investors seem to have already lost patience. Tesla's share
                    price peaked at $407.36 in 2021 and has since fallen by more
                    than half, closing on May 25, 2023, at $184.47 a share.
                  </p>

                    "Shareholders have been screaming at Musk to get back in the
                    driver's seat for a long time," Schmidt says. "Tesla can't
                    run itself in autopilot mode."

                    procedures (TTPs) is living off the land, which uses
                    built-in network administration tools to perform their
                    objectives. This TTP allows the actor to evade detection by
                    blending in with normal Windows system and network
                    activities, avoid endpoint detection and response (EDR)
                    products that would alert on the introduction of third-party
                    applications to the host, and limit the amount of activity
                    that is captured in default logging configurations. Some of
                    the built-in tools this actor uses are: wmic, ntdsutil,
                    netsh, and PowerShell. The advisory provides examples of the
                    actor's commands along with detection signatures to aid
                    network defenders in hunting for this activity.

                    MediaTek's Dimensity 9200 is one of the most powerful
                    smartphone processors of 2023, taking the fight to the
                    Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in a few areas. Now, the Taiwanese
                    chipmaker has shed more light on its next-generation
                    chipset.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    MediaTek announced on Weibo that its next-generation
                    flagship Dimensity chipset would be powered by Arm's newly
                    announced Cortex-X4 CPU core, Cortex-A720 CPU core, and Arm
                    Immortalis Mali-G720 GPU. Check out the accompanying video
                    below(*).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This isn't a surprise, as MediaTek has utilized the latest
                    CPU and GPU tech in its flagship silicon for the past two
                    years. But the news means that you can expect the
                    next-generation Dimensity chipset (presumably called the
                    Dimensity 9300) to be a major rival to the Snapdragon 8 Gen
                    3 processor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Taiwanese chipmaker also noted that the new chipset will
                    offer a "groundbreaking" architecture, adding that the
                    processor will enable improved multitasking and better
                    performance in "heavily" multi-threaded apps and games.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    MediaTek didn't mention whether its new processor will use
                    the brand-new Cortex-A520 little CPU core which debuted
                    alongside the Cortex-X4 and A720. This could be a case of
                    the company not wanting to reveal too many major details
                    right now. It's also theoretically possible (but unlikely)
                    that the new processor simply doesn't have little cores,
                    although we haven't seen a major flagship chipmaker ditch
                    these little cores before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In saying so, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 switched from four
                    little CPU cores to three (adding a fourth medium core
                    instead). Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 leaks also point to the company
                    switching to just two little cores (adding a fifth medium
                    CPU core). So it certainly seems like there's a trend to
                    reduce the number of little cores, but cutting them all
                    together would be an aggressive move and potentially have
                    ramifications for efficiency and multi-core performance.

                    is a subscription-based product designed to shield users'

                    different countries to enhance privacy and the overall
                    internet experience. The service is one of Mozilla's many

                    that goes against Firefox's supposed core values. The ad was
                    shown through the browser's Messaging System, so it was
                    difficult to block with a traditional ad-blocker like uBlock

                    "resolved" by Mozilla developers, as the ad was working as
                    intended and there was nothing to fix. Power users could

                    The highest amount of CsMPs were found near to the school's
                    entrance (up to 2481 particles per m2), while significant
                    (but lower) amounts of CsMPs were found on the second floor
                    (up to 1273 particles per m2). This shows penetration of the
                    tiny fallout particles deep into the building.
                    Interestingly, the CsMP numbers and the proportion of Cs
                    radioactivity attributed to CsMPs in nearby outdoor samples
                    were much lower (23–63 particles/g of dust or soil and
                    1.14–1.61% or total Cs radioactivity, respectively).

                    [...] Professor Bernd Grambow, a co-investigator from the
                    University of Nantes added, "Any decontamination strategy
                    needs to acknowledge that in close vicinity to the power
                    plant, large differences in contamination levels may be
                    encountered and that both ionic and particle bound Cs needs
                    to be analyzed and removed, with the latter being
                    particularly dangerous to cleaning workers."

                  <p>
                    Professor Rodney C. Ewing of Stanford University further
                    added, "This study is latest of an extended series of papers
                    that deal with the composition, characteristics, formation,
                    and number of CsMPs. The groundbreaking aspect of these
                    works is the combined application of multiple advanced
                    techniques e.g., the team's autoradiography methods,
                    high-resolution electron microscopy, and isotopic analysis.
                    The atomic-scale resolution of these studies provides a
                    model for future studies of environmental contamination."

                    [...] Intel will still include the Gaussian Neural
                    Acceleration low-power AI acceleration block that already
                    exists on its chips, marked as 'GNA 3.5' on the SoC tile in
                    the diagram (more on this below). You can also spot the 'VPU
                    2.7' block that comprises the new Movidius-based VPU block.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like Intel's stylized render, the patent image is also just
                    a graphical rendering with no real correlation to the actual
                    physical size of the dies. It's easy to see that with so
                    many external interfaces, like the memory controllers, PCIe,
                    USB, and SATA, not to mention the media and display engines
                    and power management, that the VPU cores simply can't
                    consume much of the die area on the SoC tile. For now, the
                    amount of die area that Intel has dedicated to this engine
                    is unknown.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The VPU is designed for sustained AI workloads, but Meteor
                    Lake also includes a CPU, GPU, and GNA engine that can run
                    various AI workloads. Intel's Intel says the VPU is
                    primarily for background tasks, while the GPU steps in for
                    heavier parallelized work. Meanwhile, the CPU addresses
                    light low-latency inference work. Some AI workloads can also
                    run on both the VPU and GPU simultaneously, and Intel has
                    enabled mechanisms that allow developers to target the
                    different compute layers based on the needs of the
                    application at hand. This will ultimately result in higher
                    performance at lower power -- a key goal of using the AI
                    acceleration VPU.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Intel's chips currently use the GNA block for low-power AI
                    inference for audio and video processing functions, and the
                    GNA unit will remain on Meteor Lake. However, Intel says it
                    is already running some of the GNA-focused code on the VPU
                    and achieving better results, with a heavy implication that
                    Intel will transition to the VPU entirely with future chips
                    and remove the GNA engine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Intel also disclosed that Meteor Lake has a coherent fabric
                    that enables a unified memory subsystem, meaning it can
                    easily share data among the compute elements. This is a key
                    functionality that is similar in concept to other contenders
                    in the CPU AI space, like Apple with its M-series and AMD's
                    Ryzen 7040 chips.

                    The global market for refurbished and used mobile phones is
                    expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.45%
                    from 2022 to 2030. This means it can move from $52.34
                    billion in 2021 to $64.10 billion in 2022. Several estimates
                    list the US as the fastest growing market for refurbished
                    and used mobile phones. A refurbished phone goes through a
                    process of quality check however, used phones can be dead at
                    the time of selling.

                  <p>
                    Some of the key players who champion the market of
                    refurbished and used phones are Apple Inc., Amazon, Samsung,
                    Version Communications, and Cashify. Besides these, Walmart,
                    eBay, Paytm, Huawei, Yaantra, and AT&amp;T Inc. are close
                    contenders. Seeing the brands of phones while making a
                    purchase is not enough to escape falling into legal
                    complications.

                  <p>
                    Africa and Australia have large swathes of sandy coastline
                    and coastal wetlands. By contrast, Europe and Russia's cold
                    coastline lacks mangroves or tropical coastal wetlands.
                    These differences drive the changes we found in how
                    different coasts take up or emit greenhouse gases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The strongest coastal greenhouse gas sink is Southeast Asia,
                    because of its extensive and productive tropical mangrove
                    forests and seagrasses which soak up large amounts of CO₂.
                    North America's coast is another excellent sink for
                    greenhouse gases, with its salt marshes, mangroves,
                    seagrasses—and Canada's fjords, glacier-made valleys filled
                    with seawater.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Australia and New Zealand have long stretches of
                    coastal wetlands soaking up CO₂, this is offset by a large
                    number of estuaries, many of which are a source of
                    greenhouse gases produced by decaying organic matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Coasts in Europe and Russia actually release more greenhouse
                    gases than they absorb. Their many polluted tidal estuaries
                    release greenhouse gases, but the colder climate means this
                    region has fewer coastal wetlands to soak these gases back
                    up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But across the three main greenhouse gases, eight out of the
                    ten world coastal regions are a net greenhouse gas sink.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some coasts soak up greenhouse gases while others emit more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And by reducing nutrient overload, organic matter and
                    wastewater flows into our coastal waterways, we can cut the
                    greenhouse gases emitted by polluted estuaries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Protecting our coasts is good for us, for nature and
                    for the earth system as it plunges into the climate crisis.

                    Mandiant says that not only do hackers regularly  adapt and
                    make use of red team tools to facilitate real-world attacks,
                    but its analysis of CosmicEnergy reveals that the malware's
                    functionality is also comparable to that of other malware
                    variants targeting industrial control systems (ICS), such as
                    Industroyer, thus posing a "plausible threat to affected

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mandiant tells TechCrunch that it has not observed any
                    CosmicEnergy attacks in the wild and notes that the malware
                    lacks discovery capabilities, which means hackers would need
                    to perform some internal reconnaissance to obtain
                    environment information, such as IP addresses and
                    credentials, before launching an attack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the researchers added that because the malware
                    targets the IEC-104, a network protocol commonly used in
                    industrial environments that was also targeted during the
                    2016 attack on Ukraine's power grid, CosmicEnergy poses a
                    real threat to organizations involved in electricity
                    transmission and distribution.

                    in a bad way. To me, the lab-grown burger had a strong
                    resemblance to the one from Impossible Foods. The texture
                    was similar, which makes sense since it was mostly made from
                    plants.

                    Taste-wise, I thought the lab-grown meat may have been a bit
                    closer to the beef burger, but I found myself wondering if
                    I'd feel the same way if I didn't know which was which. Was
                    my brain tricking me into thinking it tasted more like meat,
                    since I knew that there were animal cells in it? I took
                    bites of all three burgers again to try to figure it out.
                    I'm still not sure.

                    [...] There are a lot of unanswered questions about
                    lab-grown meat, including whether companies will be able to
                    produce it at commercial scale, how expensive it'll turn out
                    to be, what the climate impacts will actually look like, and
                    whether anyone will eat this in the first place.

                    [...] Unfortunately, the lawsuits have had little effect on
                    the overall number of phishing attacks and phishing-related
                    domains, which have steadily increased in volume over the
                    years.  Piscitello said the phishers tend to gravitate
                    toward registrars that offer the least resistance and lowest
                    price per domain. And with

                    >, there is rarely a shortage of super low-priced domains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The abuse of a new top-level domain is largely the result
                    of one registrar's portfolio," Piscitello told
                    KrebsOnSecurity. "Alibaba or Namecheap or another registrar
                    will run a promotion for a cheap domain, and then we'll see
                    flocking and migration of the phishers to that TLD. It's
                    like strip mining, where they'll buy hundreds or thousands
                    of domains, use those in a campaign, exhaust that TLD and
                    then move on to another provider."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Piscitello said despite the steep drop in phishing domains
                    coming out of Freenom, the alternatives available to
                    phishers are many. After all, there are more than 2,000
                    accredited domain registrars, not to mention dozens of
                    services that let anyone set up a website for free without
                    even owning a domain.

                    "There is no evidence that the trend line is even going to
                    level off," he said. "I think what the Meta lawsuit tells us
                    is that litigation is like giving someone a

                      >standing eight count</a
                    >. It temporarily disrupts a process. And in that sense,
                    litigation appears to be working."

                    First-year college students are understandably frustrated
                    when they can't get into popular upper-level electives. But
                    they usually just gripe. Paras Jha was an exception. Enraged
                    that upper-class students were given priority to enroll in a
                    computer-science elective at
                    <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/"
                      >Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey</a
                    >, Paras decided to crash the registration website so that
                    no one could enroll.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Wednesday night, 19 November 2014, at 10:00 p.m. EST—as
                    the registration period for first-year students in spring
                    courses had just opened—Paras launched his first distributed
                    denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. He had assembled an army of
                    some 40,000 bots, primarily in Eastern Europe and China, and
                    unleashed them on the Rutgers central authentication server.
                    The botnet sent thousands of fraudulent requests to
                    authenticate, overloading the server. Paras's classmates
                    could not get through to register.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Paras was furious that Rutgers chose Incapsula, a
                    small cybersecurity firm based in Massachusetts, as its
                    DDoS-mitigation provider. He claimed that Rutgers chose the
                    cheapest company. "Just to show you the poor quality of
                    Incapsula's network, I have gone ahead and decimated the
                    Rutgers network (and parts of Incapsula), in the hopes that
                    you will pick another provider that knows what they are
                    doing."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Paras's fourth attack on the Rutgers network, taking place
                    during finals, caused chaos and panic on campus. Paras
                    reveled in his ability to shut down a major state
                    university, but his ultimate objective was to force it to
                    abandon Incapsula. Paras had started his own DDoS-mitigation
                    service, ProTraf Solutions, and wanted Rutgers to pick
                    ProTraf over Incapsula. And he wasn't going to stop
                    attacking his school until it switched.

                    Despite their apparent success, LLMs are not (really)
                    'models of language' but are statistical models of the
                    regularities found in linguistic communication. Models and
                    theories should explain a phenomenon (e.g., F = ma) but LLMs
                    are not explainable because explainability requires
                    structured semantics and reversible compositionality that
                    these models do not admit (see
                    <a
                      href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/264604-new-research-vindicates-fodor-and-pylyshyn-no-explainable-ai-without-structured-semantics/fulltext"

                    >
                    for more details). In fact, and due to the subsymbolic
                    nature of LLMs, whatever 'knowledge' these models acquire
                    about language will always be buried in billions of
                    microfeatures (weights), none of which is meaningful on its
                    own. In addition to the lack of explainability, LLMs will
                    always generate biased and toxic language since they are
                    susceptible to the biases and toxicity in their training
                    data (<a
                      href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922"
                      >Bender et. al., 2021</a
                    >). Moreover, and due to their statistical nature, these
                    systems will never be trusted to decide on the
                    "truthfulness" of the content they generate (<a

                      >Borji, 2023</a
                    >) – LLMs ingest text and they cannot decide which fragments
                    of text are true and which are not. Note that none of these
                    problematic issues are a function of scale but are
                    paradigmatic issues that are a byproduct of the architecture
                    of deep neural networks (DNNs) and their training
                    procedures. Finally, and contrary to some misguided
                    narrative, these LLMs do not have human-level understanding
                    of language (for lack of space we do not discuss here the
                    limitations of LLMs regarding their linguistic competence,

                    commonsense reasoning that these models will always have

                    of how dangerous these systems are to humanity.

                we are many, many years away from AI being an existential

                    So enjoy the news about "the potential danger of AI". But
                    watch and read this news like you're watching a really funny
                    sitcom. Make a nice drink (or a nice cup of tea), listen and
                    smile. And then please, sleep well, because all is OK, no
                    matter what some self-appointed god fathers say. They might
                    know about LLMs, but they apparently never heard of BDIs.

                The author's conclusion seems to be that although AI may pose a
                threat to certain professions, it doesn't endanger the existence
                of humanity.

                    NAND, Tanguy explains, is happiest within a relatively
                    narrow temperature band. "NAND flash actually likes to be
                    'hot' in that 60° to 70° [celcius] range in order to program
                    a cell because when it's that hot, those electrons can move
                    a little bit easier," he explained.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Go a little too hot — say 80°C — and things become
                    problematic, however. At these temps, you risk the SSD's
                    built-in safety mechanisms forcibly powering down the system
                    to prevent damage. However, before this happens users are
                    likely to see the performance of their drives plummet, as
                    the SSD's controller throttles itself to prevent data loss.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The latter is one of the reasons why even during the PCIe
                    4.0 generation it wasn't uncommon to see aluminum or even
                    copper heatsinks sold alongside premium models.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The takeaway is that with PCIe 5.0 SSDs — the performance
                    oriented models in particular — some kind of cooler is
                    necessary to achieve peak performance. Whether it needs to
                    be actively cooled is another question entirely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There's also the potential for these SSD's larger
                    coolers to interfere with other components, like CPU tower
                    coolers or GPUs. This is because the majority of PCIe 5.0
                    slots are located just below the CPU socket to minimize
                    trace length to ensure signal integrity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, do you really need a liquid cooled SSD? Probably not,
                    but if you want one anyway, we can't say we blame you.

                    The report blamed the cost increases on "assumptions that
                    the use of heritage technologies from the Space Shuttle and
                    Constellation Programs were expected to result in
                    significant cost and schedule savings compared to developing
                    new systems for the SLS." Instead, integrating new systems
                    with the older components ended up being more complex,

                        NASA is trying to decrease SLS costs moving forward,
                        with the projected 30 percent price dip per engine,
                        "however, those savings do not capture overhead and
                        other costs," the report stated. Each rocket launch
                        requires four engines and two boosters; one RS-25 engine
                        currently costs around $100 million to manufacture and
                        NASA wants to keep sending crews to the Moon to
                        establish a lunar presence. The Artemis 2 mission is
                        currently slated for launch in late 2024, while Artemis
                        3 is meant to follow in 2025 or 2026.

                    In March, the agency told Wyden's office that it had a new
                    policy to restrict the promotion of these types of products
                    in the works — but ITA refused to share that policy without
                    a formal request.

                  <p>
                    Wyden didn't hesitate. In a letter [<a

                      >PDF</a
                    >] on Friday, he asked the agency to see the policy, and
                    also demanded that ITA provide a ton of details about the
                    surveillance technology companies it works with, and how it
                    makes decisions about which businesses to assist.

                    "As you know, the Biden administration has recognized that
                    surveillance technologies are frequently used by governments
                    to invade the privacy of their citizens, enable violence and
                    discrimination, and disproportionately harm marginalized and

                  <p>
                    The majority of the young people interviewed told us they
                    were only taught the basics about consent—along the lines of
                    "no means no, and yes means yes." As interviewee Miles* (17)
                    told us:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's always broadly talked about [...] but it's never
                    actually talked about what it means and what it actually
                    is."
                  </p>
                  <p>Nicola (16) added:</p>
                  <p>
                    "It was more just like if someone says 'no," 'stop' or
                    things like that and if you don't like it say 'no' and
                    things instead of the depths of it."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Consent is complex, so teaching it without necessary detail
                    or context can have devastating results. Some young people
                    may feel unable to say "no" safely in unwanted sexual
                    experiences, and others are genuinely unaware a sexual act
                    occurring, may not be consensual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the same time, teens also felt like the focus was on
                    consent at the expense of other information and topics. As
                    Tiffany (14) said,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The whole thing is consent, 'cos that's such a big thing
                    nowadays [...] we haven't been taught about sex."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Interviewees also felt current sex education was
                    overwhelmingly fear-based and focused on safety. As
                    15-year-old Lauren explained, she and her classmates had
                    been taught "what could go wrong and not anything else."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "They talk more about sexual violence and sexual assault
                    than they do about sex itself and the benefits of sex and
                    pleasure [...]. It makes it feel like it's bad to have sex
                    and that there's no pleasure in it and it's harmful."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The focus was on risk and biological aspects also left many
                    students confused in terms of how to navigate real-life
                    sexual scenarios safely. As Caris (15) explained:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's hard not knowing what to do and where to put yourself
                    and how to move and all of that. It's hard for teenagers and
                    they don't feel comfortable going to their parents."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Warren (17) said this meant teenagers were going online to
                    find more information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The lack of education causes the younger generation to
                    resort to online personal education therefore resulting in
                    more negative or destructive sexual encounters."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This echoes a

                      href="https://www.latrobe.edu.au/arcshs/work/national-survey-of-secondary-students-and-sexual-health-2022"
                      >2021–22 national survey</a
                    >, which found 95% of young Australians thought sex
                    education was an important part of the curriculum. But only
                    24.8% said their most recent class was "very" or "extremely"
                    relevant to them.

                  <p>
                    Young people interviewed also felt like their educators did
                    not have enough training to be teaching about relationships
                    and sexuality, which is taught as part of

                    from the first year of school to Year 10. As Nicola said,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's strange they have sport teachers teaching it, it's not
                    a designated teacher for that program. I think it makes a
                    lot more sense if it's someone who actually is
                    knowledgeable."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There's a common misconception that discussing sex
                    encourages young people to have sex earlier. However,
                    <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/5/e014791"
                      >research suggests</a
                    >
                    the opposite and information can actually delay sexual
                    activity. Recent
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14681811.2023.2169825"
                      >research</a
                    >
                    also shows Australian parents want schools to tackle sex and
                    relationships in more detail and from an early age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, schools need to be able to listen to the
                    concerns of teens to meet their real needs around sex
                    education in ways that are healthy, safe and relevant.

                    The scientists also developed an automatic closed-loop
                    feedback system that delivered an ultrasound pulse to keep
                    the mice in the induced torpor if they showed signs of
                    warming up. This allowed the mice to be kept at 33C in the
                    hibernation-like state for 24 hours. When the ultrasound
                    system was switched off, they woke up again.

                    The experiments, described in the journal

                      >Nature Metabolism</a

                    1C drop in core body temperature when the same brain region
                    was targeted. Chen said the result was "surprising and
                    fascinating" and the team planned to test the technique in
                    larger animals.

                    In humans, inducing a torpor-like state has potential
                    medical applications, with some suggesting that slowing down
                    metabolism could buy critical time for treating
                    life-threatening conditions such as heart attack and stroke.
                    "By extending the window for medical intervention, this
                    technique offers promising prospects for improving patients'
                    chances of survival," said Chen. "Additionally, the
                    non-invasive nature of the technique opens the possibility
                    of developing wearable ultrasound devices, such as helmets,

                    It comes as New Zealanders battle the ongoing cost of living
                    crisis, with food prices 12.5 percent higher in April this
                    year compared to 2022. The surging costs reflected higher
                    prices for fruit and vegetables, eggs and potato chips,
                    according to Stats New Zealand.

                    This increase was the largest since September 1987, which
                    included the introduction of GST in 1986.

                    Fruit and vegetable prices surged 22.5 percent year-on-year
                    and grocery prices were up 14 percent.

                    The skyrocketing prices have seen many Kiwis turn to BNPL
                    schemes to afford the basics. BNPL companies typically offer
                    on-the-spot, interest-free short-term loans with minimal
                    credit checks that spread payments over weeks or months and
                    are largely used by cash-strapped people taking debt,
                    sometimes more than they can afford.

                      >failed Hakuto-R lunar landing</a
                    >, and it sounds like tricky terrain and a late change in
                    the landing site are to blame. Apparently, Hakuto-R was able
                    to complete the whole deceleration process in preparation of
                    touching down on lunar soil. The spacecraft activated its
                    descent sequence when it reached an altitude of around 100
                    kilometers (62 miles) and was able to slow down until it was
                    only moving at a speed of less than 1 m/s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, its software had mistakenly estimated its altitude
                    to be zero when it was still hovering around 5 kilometers (3
                    miles) above the ground. In other words, it thought it had
                    already landed when it hasn't yet, and it continued
                    descending at a very slow speed near the surface until its
                    propulsion system ran out of fuel. ispace wasn't able to
                    establish contact with the spacecraft again, but it believes
                    it went on a free fall and ultimately crashed on the moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's the how, but what about the why? Well, the company
                    thinks the most likely reason why Hakuto-R's software
                    suffered from an altitude estimation issue was because it
                    got confused. While it was flying to its landing site, it
                    passed over a large cliff that was determined to be the rim
                    of a crater. The spacecraft's onboard sensor got an altitude
                    reading of 3 kilometers when it passed by the elevated
                    terrain, and that was apparently larger than the estimated
                    altitude value the Hakuto-R team set in advance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spacecraft's software erroneously thought that the
                    sensor reported an abnormal value, and it kept filtering out
                    its altitude measurements afterward. ispace built the
                    ability to reject abnormal altitude measurements into the
                    lander as a safety measure in the event of a hardware issue
                    with the sensor. However, it backfired for Mission 1 because
                    simulations of the landing sequence failed to incorporate
                    the lunar environment on the spacecraft's route. ispace made
                    the decision to change Hakuto-R's landing site after its
                    critical design review was already completed in 2021.

                    On paper, the NSDA rejects what Lavender, Gupta, and Sharma
                    are doing. Its rules state, "Judges should decide the round
                    as it is debated, not based on their personal beliefs."
                    Founded in 1925, the NSDA chooses the debate topics and
                    facilitates hundreds of tournaments, including the annual
                    national tournament, starting June 11 in Arizona, where six

                    marks the launch of Copilot in Power Pages in preview for
                    U.S. customers, an AI-powered assistant for Microsoft's
                    low-code business website creation tool, Power Pages. Given
                    prompts, Copilot can generate text, forms, chatbots and web
                    page layouts as well as create and edit image and site
                    design themes.

                  <p>
                    To create a form, for example, users can simply describe the
                    kind of form that they need and Copilot will build it and
                    auto-generate the necessary backend database tables. Those
                    tables can then be edited, removed or added to using natural
                    language within Copilot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "As the maker, you describe what you need in natural
                    language and use Copilot suggestions to design web pages,
                    create content and build complex business data forms for
                    your website," Sangya Singh, VP of Power Pages at Microsoft,
                    told TechCrunch in an email interview. "You no longer need
                    to start from a blank slate."

                    Generating a website with AI isn't exactly a novel idea —

                    can handle copy, images, layouts and more, while generators
                    like Mixo can create basic splash pages given a short

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                I'm going to simply write this quickly now. I have had very long
                discussions with a member of the community known as kolie who
                has been negotiating to try and keep SN operational, and help
                provide a realistic plan for both rebuilding the site, and
                migration. I was approached <b>after</b> the shutdown post was
                put up via public contact information. He has offered help in
                the form of hosting, capital, and helping coding a replacement
                for rehash. He has convinced me that there are enough people in
                the community that it might be possible to pay down the
                technical debt.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was asked to formally take the gun off SN's head, since it
                doesn't help recruit volunteers if there's a death sentence.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am more than a little reluctance to do this, simply on the
                basis that there has been a long history on this site of saying
                "we'll do X", and then X never happens. The situation was also
                discussed prior with Matt, and quite a few other people before I
                finally made the decision after it became clear to me that the
                situation had become completely untenable. I spent weeks looking
                for an alternative before I finally resided myself that there
                were no other viable options. But sometimes you can be wrong,
                and sometimes you can get outside help.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of my cited reasons for shutting down SN was that calls for
                help were left unanswered. However, said call finally got
                answered and came at the 11th hour, and as an unsolicited DM by
                someone who wanted to see the site go on. We have been
                discussing this at length since Monday, in a conversation that
                at this point has been longer than everything said in a private,
                staff channel for the last six months. So, I accept the
                possibility I can be wrong. More specifically, I hope I am
                wrong.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, ultimately, I will put my faith in someone I have never met
                before. It might be absurd sounding, but that is ultimately how
                SN started. A bunch of people who never met coming together to
                make a replacement for Slashdot. I will take steps to keep SN
                going past the 30th. This may involve the legal entity changing,
                as the PBC already voted to dissolve itself. I will write more
                on this next week, since frankly, I need time to sit back and
                reflect. I also need to write some emails.
              </p>
              <p>
                The staff have told me that they will not work with me going
                forward. For my part, the feeling is mutual.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are also the facts that I listed in the shutdown letter.
                SN's codebase is effectively unmaintained since the departure of
                TMB. I've already discussed the state of infrastructure to
                death, but there's an objective truth here: SN's VMs were
                exposed to the open Internet on end-of-life operating systems
                for years and the database cluster had been in an extended
                failure with corrupted log tables. As I see it, the staff
                allowed SN to degrade to the point that it was about to entirely
                fail. As I understand it, they see me as acting rashly and
                irresponsibly in attempting to address the situation. I freely
                admitted I could have done better.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of the day, the only worse outcome than a volunteer
                shutdown is one where the site is either compromised, or lost in
                a crash. SN was one hard shutdown from an unrecoverable cluster
                failure.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is not a viable state of affairs. That is a liability
                nightmare that at the end of the day the PBC is responsible for,
                which was the basis on which I intervened.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, I'm only still here because SN has never been able to
                accommodate people leaving, especially as no one has
                historically been willing to take over legal responsibility for
                the operation of the site. I resigned three years ago. SN needs
                actual governance by people who can ultimately say that Z, Y,
                and X need to be done, and have the ability to either have it
                done, or can help raise the money to help get it done.
              </p>
              <p>So, I guess we'll see if miracles happen twice.</p>

                    Saturn's rings might have formed while trilobites scuttled
                    about on Earth. Space dust has been accumulating on the icy
                    halos for no more than 400 million years, researchers report
                    in the May 12 Science Advances.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 4.5-billion-year-old planet appears to have acquired its
                    iconic ornamentation relatively recently, says physicist
                    Sascha Kempf of the University of Colorado Boulder. "We're
                    quite lucky to see a ring in the first place."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rings of Saturn are made of countless icy particles,
                    which become covered with dust as tiny meteoroids strike
                    them. These dustings darken the rings' complexion, like mud
                    sullies snow on roads in winter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The age of the rings has been debated for decades
                    [...]. Even after the new study, there's still disagreement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the rings are somehow losing dust over time, they could
                    be ancient, says planetary scientist Aurélien Crida of
                    Université Côte d'Azur in Nice, France, who was not involved
                    in the study. "Possibly as old as Saturn."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It seems clear that the rings have been exposed to
                    micrometeoroid impacts for at least a hundred million years,
                    Crida says. But simulations of the rings' formation from the
                    gravitational shredding of an early moon suggest their size
                    is consistent with an age of billions of years, he says. And
                    researchers have reported silicate grains falling from the
                    rings into Saturn's atmosphere (SN: 10/4/18). Some
                    unidentified process might be cleaning the rings of the
                    micrometeoroid dust, making them appear younger than they
                    are, Crida says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Experiments that smash micrometeoroids into ice
                    particles could help resolve the discrepancy, Crida says.
                    For now, the debate over the age of the rings lives on.

                    [...] "If that coastal migration correlates with building
                    new infrastructure along the coast, it's very likely that we
                    will see a change in land elevation," says Virginia Tech
                    environmental security expert Manoochehr Shirzaei, who did
                    the previous study of subsidence on the East Coast. (He
                    wasn't part of this research team but reviewed their paper
                    for the journal.)

                  <p>
                    A major concern for coastal areas, Shirzaei says, is the
                    deformation of floodplains. "The area has to have a certain
                    slope, so if there is heavy precipitation, water drains,"
                    Shirzaei says. "But when you have structures that create
                    localized subsidence, it temporarily changes the slope of
                    the floodplains. So it means that water would sit there for
                    longer periods of time." This essentially creates a great
                    big bowl for heavy rainfall to fill, which can flood roads
                    and buildings. Even worse, climate change is already causing

                    can help. When wetlands are healthy, they receive silt from
                    rivers, which replenishes the sediment. Wetlands also act
                    like natural sea walls, absorbing storm surges and keeping
                    them from inundating cities. Restoring these ecosystems will
                    simultaneously boost biodiversity and turn coastal lands
                    from a liability into a tool for adapting to the twin
                    threats of subsidence and rising sea levels.

                    But in many places, such mitigation efforts will have a hard
                    time keeping up with the pace of coastal development. "A lot
                    of people for obvious reasons want to live on coasts, where
                    there's opportunities," says Parsons. "The growth of people
                    means growth of construction and groundwater demands, so
                    we're likely to see this accelerate."

                    It's been 30 years since Russian software engineer Eugene
                    Roshal created the RAR archive format. RAR allows users to
                    compress files so they take up less room on your hard drive.

                    Scientists have invented a device that can continuously
                    generate electricity from thin air, offering a glimpse of a
                    possible sustainable energy source that can be made of
                    almost any material and runs on the ambient humidity that
                    surrounds all of us, reports a new study.

                    The novel "air generator," or Air-gen, is made from
                    materials with holes that are under 100 nanometers in
                    length, which is a scale thousand times smaller than a human
                    hair. This design can pull electricity from water droplets
                    in the air for much longer periods than previous concepts,
                    the researchers report, suggesting that it could eventually
                    provide a continuous and sustainable source of power.
                    Researchers hope the technique could eventually help to
                    fight climate change by serving as an alternative to fossil
                    fuels.

                    [...] Now, researchers at the University of Massachusetts,
                    Amherst, have developed an Air-gen device that yields
                    electricity from contact with water droplets that pass
                    through its porous material. In this way, the Air-gen
                    technology creates "a spontaneous and sustained charging
                    gradient for continuous electric output" that "opens a wide
                    door for the broad exploration of sustainable electricity
                    from ambient air," according to
                    <a
                      href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202300748"
                      >a study published on Wednesday</a
                    >
                    in Advanced Materials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Indeed, the results revealed that practically any
                    material could become an Air-gen device provided it was
                    perforated with tiny holes measuring 100 nanometers or
                    fewer. At this scale, the holes are big enough to allow
                    water to pass through an upper chamber into a lower chamber,
                    but are small enough that the droplets make contact with the
                    material as they move down through the holes. As a
                    consequence, a charge imbalance is created in the device
                    because the water droplets increase the charge of the upper
                    layer by soaking it as they move into the lower chamber.

                    The boss of the company behind ChatGPT has said it might

                    "The current draft of the EU AI Act would be
                    over-regulating," OpenAI's Sam Altman said,

                    Many in the creative industries accuse AI companies of using
                    the work of artists, musicians and actors to train systems
                    to imitate their work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Mr Altman is worried it would be technically impossible
                    for OpenAI to comply with some of the AI Act's safety and
                    transparency requirements, according to

                    At an event at University College London, Mr Altman added he
                    was optimistic AI could create more jobs and reduce
                    inequality.

                    risks - from disinformation to national security and even
                    "existential threats" - and the voluntary actions and

                    [...] Mosquitoes have a keen ability to detect heat and are
                    naturally drawn toward it. This means that if you've
                    recently exercised or have a high metabolism, you may be
                    more attractive to mosquitoes than others. The higher your
                    body temperature, the more likely you are to attract these
                    pesky insects. Even if you don't have type-O blood, you are
                    still at higher risk of a mosquito bite.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It is estimated that pregnant women attract twice as
                    many mosquito bites compared to other people due to these
                    factors combined. It's important for expecting mothers to
                    take precautions against mosquito bites during pregnancy, as
                    they may be at risk of contracting diseases like Zika virus
                    or West Nile, which can have serious consequences for both
                    mother and baby if left untreated. No matter what your blood
                    type, avoiding mosquito bites during pregnancy is wise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Research indicates that what you eat may influence the
                    amount of mosquitoes that are drawn to you. A single
                    12-ounce bottle of beer may increase the likelihood of being
                    bitten by mosquitoes, possibly because alcohol raises skin
                    temperature or emits volatile organic compounds. People on
                    ketotic diets may be more attractive to mosquitoes due to
                    the presence of ketones in their bodies, which act as an
                    attractant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mosquitoes are notorious for being attracted to
                    humans, but did you know that the color of your clothes can
                    make a difference in how likely you are to get bitten?
                    According to research, mosquitoes have a preference for dark
                    colors. While their sense of sight isn't as sharp as their
                    sense of smell, they use vision to locate humans and
                    identify potential prey. Dark objects stand out more against
                    lighter backgrounds, making them easier targets for
                    mosquitoes.

                    Jovian lightning emits radio wave pulses that are typically
                    separated by about one millisecond, researchers report May
                    23 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. The energetic
                    prestissimo, the scientists say, is a sign that

                      >the gas giant's lightning propagates in pulses</a
                    >, at a pace comparable to that of the bolts that cavort
                    through our own planet's thunderclouds. The similarities
                    between the two world's electrical phenomena could have
                    implications for the search for alien life.

                    Arcs of lightning on both worlds appear to move somewhat
                    like a winded hiker going up a mountain, pausing after each
                    step to catch their breath, says Ivana Kolmašová, an
                    atmospheric physicist at the Czech Academy of Sciences in
                    Prague. "One step, another step, then another step ... and
                    so on."

                  <p>
                    Here on Earth, lightning forms as turbulent winds within
                    thunderclouds cause many ice crystals and water droplets to
                    rub together, become charged and then move to opposite sides
                    of the clouds, progressively generating static electrical
                    charges. When the charges grow big enough to overcome the
                    air's ability to insulate them, electrons are released — the
                    lightning takes its first step. From there, the surging
                    electrons will repeatedly ionize the air and rush into it,
                    lurching the bolt forward at an average of hundreds of
                    thousands of meters per second.

                    might also form by collisions between ice crystals and water
                    droplets (<em>SN: 8/5/20</em>). But no one knew whether the
                    alien lightning extended and branched in increments, as they
                    do on Earth, or if they took some other form.

                    Virgin Orbit will cease operations and sell its assets to
                    four winning bidders, the company announced Tuesday. Those
                    bidders include three aerospace companies—Rocket Lab,
                    Stratolaunch and Vast Space subsidiary Launcher—with
                    combined bids totaling almost $36 million, according to
                    court documents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A sale hearing for court approval is scheduled for Wednesday
                    afternoon and transactions are expected to close soon after,
                    the company said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Virgin Orbit's legacy in the space industry will forever be
                    remembered," Virgin Orbit said in a Tuesday statement. "Its
                    groundbreaking technologies, relentless pursuit of
                    excellence, and unwavering commitment to advancing the
                    frontiers of air launch have left an indelible mark on the
                    industry."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Virgin Orbit was founded in 2017 by Branson, a British
                    billionaire, in hopes of targeting the market for launching
                    small satellites into space. Its LauncherOne rockets were
                    launched from the air from modified Virgin passenger planes,
                    allowing the company to operate more flexibly than using
                    fixed launch sites.

                    [...] WMO meanwhile warned that while deaths have plunged,
                    the economic losses incurred when weather, climate and water
                    extremes hit have soared.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Developed nations accounted for over 60 percent of
                    losses due to weather, climate and water disasters, but in
                    more than four-fifths of cases, the economic losses were
                    equivalent to less than 0.1 percent of gross domestic
                    product (GDP).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And no disasters saw reported economic losses greater than
                    3.5 percent of the respective GDPs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By comparison, in seven percent of the disasters to hit the
                    world's least developed countries, losses equivalent to more
                    than five percent of their GDP were reported, with several
                    disasters causing losses equivalent to nearly a third of
                    GDP.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And for small island developing states, one fifth of
                    disasters saw economic losses of over five percent of GDP,
                    with some causing economic losses above 100 percent.

                    that AI represents an "existential risk" that could get many
                    people "harmed or killed." He doesn't feel that threat is
                    serious at the moment, but he sees a near future where AI
                    could help find software security flaws or new biology
                    types. It's important to ensure these systems aren't
                    "misused by evil people," the veteran executive says.

                    Schmidt doesn't have a firm solution for regulating AI, but
                    he believes there won't be an AI-specific regulator in the
                    US. He participated in a National Security Commission on AI
                    that reviewed the technology and published a 2021 report
                    determining that the US wasn't ready for the tech's impact.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Schmidt doesn't have direct influence over AI. However, he
                    joins a growing number of well-known moguls who have argued
                    for a careful approach. Current Google CEO Sundar Pichai has
                    cautioned that society needs to adapt to AI, while OpenAI
                    leader Sam Altman has expressed concern that authoritarians
                    might abuse these algorithms. In March, numerous industry
                    leaders and researchers (including Elon Musk and Steve
                    Wozniak) signed an open letter calling on companies to pause
                    AI experiments for six months while they rethought the
                    safety and ethical implications of their work.

                    [...] The idea of launching far from shore could resolve
                    some environmental concerns on land, but it's not yet clear
                    whether rocket launches at sea could also cause damage to
                    marine life, or if offshore platforms are resilient enough
                    to launch megarockets the likes of Starship. As for smaller
                    rockets, that seems more feasible, as these recent tests
                    suggest.

                  <p>
                    Future tests will have to determine if bigger rockets,
                    especially those capable of reaching orbit, can launch from
                    The Spaceport Company's facilities. Importantly, the company

                    As a concept, launching rockets from mobile sea platforms is
                    nothing new. In 2019, China became the third country after
                    the U.S. and Russia to do so.

                    Why do I teach idealistic young people how to lead a life of
                    cybercrime? Many of my students will pursue careers in
                    government or with law firms whose clients include major
                    technology companies. I want these budding lawyers to
                    understand their clients' issues. But my larger aim is to
                    put technical expertise in its place: I want my students to
                    realize that technology alone is not enough to solve the
                    problems we face.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I start my class by explaining the fundamental principle of
                    modern computing: the distinction between code and data.
                    Code is a set of instructions: "add," "print my résumé,"
                    "shut the door." Data is information. Data is usually
                    represented by numbers (the temperature is 80 degrees), code
                    by words ("add"). But in 1936, the British mathematician
                    Alan Turing figured out that code could be represented by
                    numbers as well. Indeed, Turing was able to show how to
                    represent both code and data using only ones and zeros —
                    so-called binary strings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This groundbreaking insight makes modern computers possible.
                    We don't need to rebuild our computers for every new
                    program. We can feed our devices whatever code we like as
                    binary strings and run that program. That zeros and ones can
                    represent both code and data is, however, a blessing and a
                    curse, because it enables hackers to trick computers that
                    are expecting data into accepting and running malicious code
                    instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Diversion programs in Britain and the Netherlands run
                    hacking competitions where teams of coders compete to hack a
                    target network; these programs also seek to match up coders
                    with older security personnel to act as mentors and direct
                    their charges into the legitimate cybersecurity industry. At
                    the moment, with an estimated 3.5 million jobs unfilled
                    worldwide, one fewer attacker is one more desperately needed
                    defender.

                    is a flexible system with use cases ranging from retro
                    gaming platforms to industrial use cases for factories and
                    more. Today we're sharing one research team's foray into
                    science with the help of our favorite SBC and looking at how
                    well it compares to modern, more expensive tools. Liam
                    Taylor, Duncan Quincy, and Mark Smith recently deployed a
                    set of Raspberry Pis to help monitor glacier calving in both
                    <a href="https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/23/329/2023"
                      >Iceland and Peru</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the team, monitoring calving fronts is critical
                    as extreme changes can result in environmental impacts for
                    local residents. For example, things like tsunamis, floods,
                    and the collapse of icebergs can cause serious damage, and
                    monitoring these changes can help those living nearby
                    respond before the problems worsen. Part of their research
                    was to test the performance of a Raspberry Pi in monitoring
                    these changes against more conventional tools they usually
                    use, in this case, an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To test the Pi against the UAV monitoring system, the team
                    traveled to Fjallsjökull, Iceland. Here they could survey
                    glaciers both from the shore and from a boat. The area also
                    had a great variety of calving margin heights that made it
                    easier to test the accuracy of the Raspberry Pi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Raspberry Pis were tested using both a Camera Module V2
                    and an HQ Camera Module using a 16mm telephoto lens. The
                    Camera Module V2 proved too inadequate for their
                    measurements, so the team opted to stick with the HQ Camera
                    Module. The UAV chosen to compare against the Pi was a DJI
                    Mavic 2 Pro UAV. The Raspberry Pis were then attached to a
                    tripod with critical components like batteries stored inside
                    a weatherproofed box.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team mounted some of the Pis to a boat as they passed by
                    while the UAV moved overhead. Recording the glaciers
                    simultaneously allowed the team to get an accurate
                    comparison of the charting ability of both devices. Using
                    the pictures taken by the Pi, the team created a 3D render
                    of the glaciers using photogrammetry.

                    A molecule that was initially developed to treat
                    tuberculosis but failed to progress out of the lab as an
                    antibiotic is now showing promise as a powerful foe for
                    weeds that invade our gardens and cost farmers billions of
                    dollars each year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the failed antibiotic wasn't fit for its original
                    purpose, scientists at the University of Adelaide discovered
                    that by tweaking its structure, the molecule became
                    effective at killing two of the most problematic weeds in
                    Australia, annual ryegrass and wild radish, without harming
                    bacterial and human cells. This research has been published
                    in the journal <i>Communications Biology</i>.

                    existing herbicides on the market, costing farmers billions
                    of dollars each year," said lead researcher Dr. Tatiana

                    Research Institute.

                    for faster development of new, more effective weed killers

                    Researchers at the University's Herbicide and Antibiotic
                    Innovation Lab discovered there were similarities between
                    bacterial superbugs and weeds at a molecular level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They exploited these similarities, and by chemically
                    modifying the structure of a failed antibiotic, they were
                    able to block the production of amino acid lysine, which is
                    essential for weed growth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There are no commercially available herbicides on the
                    market that work in this way. In fact, in the past 40 years,
                    there have been hardly any new herbicides with new
                    mechanisms of action that have entered the market," said Dr.
                    Andrew Barrow, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Soares da
                    Costa's team at the University of Adelaide's Waite Research

                    [...] It's not just farmers who could reap the benefits of
                    this discovery. Researchers say it could also lead to the
                    development of new weed killers to target pesky weeds
                    growing in our backyards and driveways.

                    "Our re-purposing approach has the potential to discover
                    herbicides with broad applications that can kill a variety
                    of weeds," said Dr. Barrow.

                    When working memristor technology was first announced, it
                    generated a lot of excitement within the tech industry. This
                    was mainly because memristors promised faster, more
                    energy-efficient, and longer-lasting storage solutions than
                    traditional RAM and SSDs. This led to high expectations and
                    a flurry of investments in research and development.
                    However, the hype surrounding memristors has significantly
                    waned in recent years, with the technology yet to impact the
                    market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite their potential advantages, several challenges have
                    hindered the widespread adoption of memristor technology.
                    Manufacturing memristors at a large scale has proven
                    difficult and expensive. This has limited the number of
                    companies willing to invest in developing and producing
                    memristor-based devices. Also, while memristors have shown
                    promise in laboratory settings, their real-world application
                    performance has not always met expectations. Factors such as
                    temperature fluctuations and material inconsistencies have
                    led to variable performance and stability issues. To quote
                    Wikipedia "Experimentally, the ideal memristor has yet to be
                    demonstrated." So those diligently working on the problem
                    are looking for a tantalizingly close breakthrough.

                    account tweeted "Love is sharing a password." And at CES in

                    Streaming companies have been tweaking their businesses over
                    the past year as they struggle with increasing competition
                    and the reality that people can only afford so many monthly
                    subscription fees. Many have raised prices, including Prime
                    Video, Netflix and Apple TV Plus, but no other company has
                    gone after account sharing in the same way.

                    Extreme weather caused by climate change has damaged food
                    production across Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Confronted with a deteriorating situation, divided European
                    Union decision-makers are debating new rules for genetically
                    modified crops.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last year's drought ravaged the continent's farms, starving
                    everything from Spanish olive harvests to Hungary's maize
                    and sunflower crops, Italian and Romanian corn fields to
                    France's dairy production.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some argue the answer to Europe's problems is deregulating
                    gene modification techniques to produce better crops. Others
                    claim this would be a "smokescreen" to avoid having to
                    radically change the way the bloc farms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Supporters say seeds produced using gene editing techniques
                    are less vulnerable to drought and disease—and require less
                    water.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The powerful European farming lobby group Copa-Cogeca
                    supports the new rules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If we need to supply society with food in Europe, and if we
                    want to be self-sufficient, then we need to adapt rules,"
                    said Thor Gunnar Kofoed, chair of the seed working group at
                    Copa-Cogeca.
                  </p>
                  <p>A majority of EU lawmakers support relaxing the rules.</p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Greens want a full risk assessment to avoid
                    unintended effects and force producers to ensure detection
                    and traceability methods, and make labeling compulsory.
                  </p>

                    Facebook parent company Meta received a record-breaking $1.3
                    billion fine in Europe (€1.2 billion) following a privacy
                    violation that regulators have been investigating for a
                    decade. It involves the transfer of Facebook data belonging
                    to European Union users to the US. The EU started looking
                    into the company's data transfer practices in 2013,
                    following the Edward Snowden revelations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The EU action comes just months ahead of a new planned data
                    transfer deal between the US and the EU. Unsurprisingly,
                    Meta is contesting the fine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The EU worries that the Facebook data transfers in
                    question expose its citizens to privacy violations and
                    violate GDPR. The data transfers were protected by a US-EU
                    pact called the Privacy Shield. But the EU's top courts
                    found that the pact did not actually shield EU citizens. US
                    surveillance programs could still collect data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the new ruling, Meta also has to stop
                    transferring EU data to the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Schrems also said he expects Meta to appeal the
                    decision but that a win for the company in the case is
                    unlikely. "Past violations cannot be overcome by a new EU-US
                    deal. Meta can at best delay the payment of the fine for a
                    bit."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meta, of course, is in a position where it can afford to pay
                    such hefty privacy fines. "A billion-euro parking ticket is
                    of no consequence to a company that earns many more billions
                    by parking illegally," Johnny Ryan told The Guardian. Ryan
                    is a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Fine and restrictions aside, Meta will soon be able to
                    transfer user data to the US without having to worry about
                    fines like this. The EU and the US are working on a new deal
                    to cover such data transfers. That deal could be in place by
                    October. Still, the new agreement can't protect the company
                    from past offenses.

                    heartbreaking post detailed what had just happened — she
                    offered a $500 reward for the return of the R6.

                    After some people had falsely claimed they had her camera,

                  <p>
                    "I was initially hesitant," says Lee. "They sent me photos
                    of the camera and I knew right away it was mine — I
                    definitely blacked out for a second. I couldn't believe it."

                    The kind-hearted couple drove two hours to return the camera
                    and did not want the reward money, but Lee insisted that
                    they were compensated plus gas money.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The one caveat was that after the couple bought the
                    camera they had cleared the SD card. But, Lee is working

                OK, it is not a 'techie' or a STEM story - but how many of us
                have lost something absolutely vital to our work? A laptop
                maybe, or probably a cell/mobile phone with all the data that it
                contains. What measures do you take now to prevent a similar
                loss in the future?
