                    The water coming out of your faucet is safe to drink, but
                    that doesn't mean it's completely clean. Chlorine has long
                    been the standard for water treatment, but it often contains
                    trace levels of disinfection byproducts and unknown
                    contaminants. Georgia Institute of Technology researchers
                    developed the minus approach to handle these harmful
                    byproducts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead of relying on traditional chemical addition (known
                    as the plus approach), the minus approach avoids
                    disinfectants, chemical coagulants, and advanced oxidation
                    processes typical to water treatment processes. It uses a
                    unique mix of filtration methods to remove byproducts and
                    pathogens, enabling water treatment centers to use
                    ultraviolet light and much smaller doses of chemical
                    disinfectants to minimize future bacterial growth down the
                    distribution system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The minus approach is a groundbreaking philosophical
                    concept in water treatment," said Yongsheng Chen, the Bonnie
                    W. and Charles W. Moorman IV Professor in the School of
                    Civil and Environmental Engineering. "Its primary objective
                    is to achieve these outcomes while minimizing the reliance
                    on chemical treatments, which can give rise to various
                    issues in the main water treatment stream."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chen and his student Elliot Reid, the primary author,
                    presented
                    <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c09389"
                      >the minus approach</a
                    >
                    in the paper, "The Minus Approach Can Redefine the Standard
                    of Practice of Drinking Water Treatment," in the
                    <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i> journal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The minus approach physically separates emerging
                    contaminants and disinfection byproducts from the main water
                    treatment process using these already proven processes:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The minus approach is intended to engage the water community
                    in designing safer, more sustainable, and more intelligent
                    systems. Because its technologies are already available and
                    proven, the minus approach can be implemented immediately.

                    Intel will release Thunderbolt 5 technical collateral and
                    development resources to developers in Q4 of 2024, Jason

                    at Intel, told reporters ahead of the announcement.

                    The main feature of the new specification is its ability to
                    transmit data at up to 120 gigabits per second (Gbps) while
                    simultaneously receiving data at up to 40 Gbps. The mode,
                    which Intel is dubbing Bandwidth Boost, only occurs when a
                    high-bandwidth display is connected.

                    Turchin, however, now holds a different view. Increasing
                    evidence suggested that "simple" Neolithic farmers'
                    societies also collapsed. "In fact, such cases are much more
                    profound than the social and political breakdown of more
                    recent societies, because archaeology indicates that
                    substantial regions were depopulated."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Since we don't see consistent large-scale political
                    organization during this time, it would be easy to imagine
                    that things were static, such that people settled in a
                    village and lived there for three or four thousand years
                    without much happening in between. That doesn't seem to be
                    the case. Sadly, this also means that this period was more
                    violent than previously thought."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Additionally, the study indicates that humans and
                    their interactions, whether friendly or violent, form a
                    complex system, regardless of their political or economic
                    organization. It doesn't matter if you don't want to
                    organize into a state, you are still affected by your
                    neighbors and their neighbors as well," adds Kondor.

                    has reported that even though the components for Apple's
                    chips will be manufactured in the US, they'll still have to
                    be sent back to TSMC's home country for assembly.

                    Apparently, the manufacturer's factory in Arizona doesn't
                    have the facilities to package its customers' more advanced
                    chips. "Packaging" is what you call the final stage of
                    fabrication, wherein the chip's components are assembled
                    inside a housing as close together as possible to enhance
                    speed and power efficiency. The iPhone, in particular, has
                    been using a packaging method developed by TSMC since 2016.
                    Chips for iPads and Macs can be packaged outside of Taiwan,
                    but the iPhone's will have to be assembled in the country.

                    boost chip packaging in the US, it's aware of the need to
                    bring the process into the country, as well. Apple and all
                    the aforementioned TSMC clients aren't the only companies
                    whose chips have to be sent overseas for assembly, since
                    manufacturers aren't making enough products in the US to
                    justify building packaging facilities in the country.
                    However, that program is only getting $2.5 billion in
                    funding under the CHIPS Act, and the Institute of Printed
                    Circuits told the publication that the amount shows
                    packaging isn't being prioritized. As for TSMC,
                    <em>The Information's</em> sources said it has no plans to
                    build packaging facilities in the US due to the huge costs
                    involved, and any future packaging method it develops will
                    most likely be offered in Taiwan.

                    [...] But CTE is preventable. Small changes to practice
                    drills and gameplay could make a huge difference for young
                    athletes, says Nowinski. The playbook for prevention is
                    simple: Reduce the number of hits to the head, and reduce
                    the strength of those hits. Most happen during practice, so
                    by reducing the number of drills involving head impacts and
                    choosing ones that are less likely to cause high-magnitude
                    blows, coaches can spare their players unnecessary danger.
                    "You can't get rid of CTE in tackling sports," adds
                    Nowinski, "but you can get rid of most cases of CTE."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Reducing the length of each game and the number of games per
                    season can minimize the likelihood of head injuries, and
                    banning brain-jostling events, like fighting in hockey or
                    heading in soccer, can make games safer, he continues.
                    Perhaps most importantly, youth sports leagues can raise the
                    age at which kids are first exposed to preventable head
                    impacts. "With tackle football before 14, the risks are not
                    worth the benefits," Nowinski says. "You don't become a
                    better football player from playing young." In one case
                    study reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and
                    Prevention, transitioning from tackle to flag football would
                    reduce a young athlete's median number of head impacts per
                    season from 378 to eight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, Nowinski points out, there is no central governing body
                    in charge of youth sports leagues, leaving it largely up to
                    individual coaches to make changes to their practice drills
                    and recruitment strategies. "The opportunity is right in
                    front of our faces," says Nowinski. "I remember being told
                    how much football makes you a leader. But right now, on this
                    issue, there's a black hole of leadership."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    McKee doesn't think that parents should take their kids out
                    of sports—far from it. "We just need to change the rules and
                    our thinking about these games, so that CTE isn't a
                    consequence of playing contact sports," McKee says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And for young athletes concerned about CTE, she urges them
                    to seek help for mental health symptoms, build personal
                    support systems, and keep moving forward with their lives.
                    "Individuals like Evan need to be seen, because in all
                    likelihood, we can treat their symptoms and help them feel
                    less hopeless," she says. "It's not a time to despair. It's
                    a time to come in, be evaluated, and be treated."

                    A team of planetary scientists at Arizona State University
                    has found evidence that the multitude of bright flashes in
                    Venus' atmosphere may be due to meteors passing through, not
                    lightning strikes. In their paper published in
                    <i>Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets,</i> the group
                    describes their study of the flashes of light and what they
                    learned about them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists studying Venus have noted periodic flashes of
                    light in its atmosphere for many years. For most of that
                    time the flashes have been attributed to lightning flashing
                    through the planet's atmosphere. Probes sent to the planet
                    have done little to confirm the origin of the flashes—bursts
                    of electromagnetic static have been recorded, which have
                    been likened to the type heard during thunderstorms on
                    Earth, suggesting lightning as a likely source.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But there has also been a sticking point—recorded bursts of
                    static and images of a light flashing through the atmosphere
                    have never been observed happening at the same time. Also,
                    there is little evidence showing that Venus' atmosphere is
                    capable of producing lightning. Such issues led the
                    researchers on this new effort to consider another
                    source—meteors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In comparing the number of flashes recorded in Venus'
                    atmosphere with the number of possible meteor strikes, the
                    team found them to be close enough to suggest that they
                    could be related. More research is required, but if the
                    initial findings turn out to be correct, space agencies will
                    breathe a sigh of relief—sending a probe through clouds
                    laden with lightning strikes is far more difficult than one
                    where the skies are occasionally lit up by meteors.

                    cruising across highways is one of those tempting technocrat
                    ideas that doesn't look like it will pan out. As autonomous
                    driving technology matured in the middle of the last decade,
                    we saw trials of the concept, but human truck drivers do
                    more than just throttle, steer, and brake, and they aren't
                    likely to be replaced soon.

                    A better idea would be to shift some of that cargo to our
                    underutilized railways—here, the idea of platooning is an
                    old one, better known as a "train." Parallel Systems hopes
                    to do just that with its second-generation autonomous
                    battery-electric freight railcar.

                    For state-sponsored hacking operations, unpatched
                    vulnerabilities are valuable ammunition. Intelligence
                    agencies and militaries seize on hackable bugs when they're
                    revealed—exploiting them to carry out their campaigns of
                    espionage or cyberwar—or spend millions to dig up new ones
                    or to buy them in secret from the hacker gray market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But for the past two years, China has added another approach
                    to obtaining information about those vulnerabilities: a law
                    that simply demands that any network technology business
                    operating in the country hand it over. When tech companies
                    learn of a hackable flaw in their products, they're now
                    required to tell a Chinese government agency—which, in some
                    cases, then shares that information with China's
                    state-sponsored hackers, according to a new investigation.
                    And some evidence suggests foreign firms with China-based
                    operations are complying with the law, indirectly giving
                    Chinese authorities hints about potential new ways to hack
                    their own customers.

                    vulnerabilities in tech products.<br />[...]<br />The
                    report's authors combed through the Chinese government's own
                    descriptions of that program to chart the complex path the
                    vulnerability information then takes: The data is shared
                    with several other government bodies, including China's
                    National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical
                    Teams/Coordination Center, or CNCERT/CC, an agency devoted
                    to defending Chinese networks. But the researchers found
                    that CNCERT/CC makes its reports available to technology
                    "partners" that include exactly the sort of Chinese
                    organizations devoted not to fixing security vulnerabilities
                    but to exploiting them. One such partner is the Beijing

                    Located in the 28-mile-long and 22-mile-wide McDermitt
                    Caldera, the discovery of the deposit will be a massive
                    boost to the United States' lithium reserves, which have
                    been estimated at just one million metric tons. Most of the
                    world's major deposits are in countries outside of North
                    America, such as Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, China and
                    Australia. It could also encourage more US investment in
                    electric cars and will alleviate fears over lithium
                    shortages – it's thought that a million metric tons of
                    lithium will be needed by 2024.

                  <p>
                    "It could change the dynamics of lithium globally, in terms
                    of price, security of supply and geopolitics," Belgian
                    geologist Anouk Borst told

                    industries would be less scared about supply shortages."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The size of the deposit still has to be confirmed, but
                    Lithium Americas Corporation says it expects to start mining
                    the supply in 2026.

                  <p>
                    [...] Not everyone is celebrating the discovery, especially
                    the Native American tribes who say the land is sacred. There
                    are also potential dangers to native wildlife, and
                    researchers are worried that the project will cause
                    groundwater levels to drop to dangerous levels. Even NASA
                    has spoken out against mining in the area. The space agency
                    has been using Nevada's Railroad Valley lakebed since 1993
                    to accurately gauge the time it takes for satellite signals
                    to travel to Earth and back, allowing it to calibrate the
                    satellites.

                    A new investigation with NASA's James Webb Space Telescope
                    into K2-18 b, an exoplanet 8.6 times as massive as Earth,
                    has revealed the presence of carbon-bearing molecules
                    including methane and carbon dioxide. Webb's discovery adds
                    to recent studies suggesting that K2-18 b could be a Hycean
                    exoplanet, one which has the potential to possess a
                    hydrogen-rich atmosphere and a water ocean-covered surface.

                    The first insight into the atmospheric properties of this
                    habitable-zone exoplanet came from

                    and lies 120 light-years from Earth in the constellation
                    Leo. Exoplanets such as K2-18 b, which have sizes between
                    those of Earth and Neptune, are unlike anything in our solar
                    system. This lack of equivalent nearby planets means that
                    these 'sub-Neptunes' are poorly understood, and the nature
                    of their atmospheres is a matter of active debate among
                    astronomers.<br />[...]<br />The abundance of methane and
                    carbon dioxide, and shortage of ammonia, support the
                    hypothesis that there may be a water ocean underneath a
                    hydrogen-rich atmosphere in K2-18 b. These initial Webb
                    observations also provided a possible detection of a
                    molecule called dimethyl sulfide (DMS). On Earth, this is
                    only produced by life. The bulk of the DMS in Earth's
                    atmosphere is emitted from phytoplankton in marine
                    environments.

                  <p>
                    The inference of DMS is less robust and requires further
                    validation. "Upcoming Webb observations should be able to
                    confirm if DMS is indeed present in the atmosphere of K2-18
                    b at significant levels," explained Madhusudhan.

                  <p>
                    While K2-18 b lies in the habitable zone, and is now known
                    to harbor carbon-bearing molecules, this does not
                    necessarily mean that the planet can support life. The
                    planet's large size — with a radius 2.6 times the radius of
                    Earth — means that the planet's interior likely contains a
                    large mantle of high-pressure ice, like Neptune, but with a
                    thinner hydrogen-rich atmosphere and an ocean surface.
                    Hycean worlds are predicted to have oceans of water.
                    However, it is also possible that the ocean is too hot to be
                    habitable or be liquid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Although this kind of planet does not exist in our solar
                    system, sub-Neptunes are the most common type of planet
                    known so far in the galaxy," explained team member Subhajit
                    Sarkar of Cardiff University. "We have obtained the most
                    detailed spectrum of a habitable-zone sub-Neptune to date,
                    and this allowed us to work out the molecules that exist in
                    its atmosphere."

                  <p>
                    Characterizing the atmospheres of exoplanets like K2-18 b —
                    meaning identifying their gases and physical conditions — is
                    a very active area in astronomy. However, these planets are
                    outshone — literally — by the glare of their much larger
                    parent stars, which makes exploring exoplanet atmospheres
                    particularly challenging.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team sidestepped this challenge by analyzing light from
                    K2-18 b's parent star as it passed through the exoplanet's
                    atmosphere. K2-18 b is a transiting exoplanet, meaning that
                    we can detect a drop in brightness as it passes across the
                    face of its host star. This is how the exoplanet was first
                    discovered in 2015 with NASA's K2 mission. This means that
                    during transits a tiny fraction of starlight will pass
                    through the exoplanet's atmosphere before reaching
                    telescopes like Webb. The starlight's passage through the
                    exoplanet atmosphere leaves traces that astronomers can
                    piece together to determine the gases of the exoplanet's
                    atmosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This result was only possible because of the extended
                    wavelength range and unprecedented sensitivity of Webb,
                    which enabled robust detection of spectral features with
                    just two transits," said Madhusudhan. "For comparison, one
                    transit observation with Webb provided comparable precision
                    to eight observations with Hubble conducted over a few years
                    and in a relatively narrow wavelength range."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These results are the product of just two observations of
                    K2-18 b, with many more on the way," explained team member
                    Savvas Constantinou of the University of Cambridge. "This
                    means our work here is but an early demonstration of what
                    Webb can observe in habitable-zone exoplanets."

                    The very first web browser was the WorldWideWeb of
                    Berners-Lee, but the first popularized web browser was the
                    NCSA Mosaic Internet Web Browser. Previous web browsers were
                    not user friendly; they lacked an intuitive and inviting way
                    to allow people to navigate the then-new World Wide Web.In
                    1992 two developers at the National Center for
                    Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of
                    Illinois (Marc Andreessen and Eric Brina) began working on a
                    graphical, user friendly web browser they would later call
                    "Mosaic". The most notable features this computer program
                    had that other browsers lacked were the ability to view
                    pictures directly on the page, its ease of navigation, and
                    the way this browser handled hyperlinks. Previous browsers
                    only showed pictures as separate files available for
                    download that were linked to the page, so no pictures were
                    directly visible from any main web page. Other browsers also
                    lacked a smooth graphical interface to help navigate through
                    the page, to include scrolling and the now-standard "back",
                    "forward", and "refresh" buttons. Finally, the Mosaic
                    browser was the first browser to incorporate clickable
                    hyperlinks. Previous browsers gave reference numbers so
                    users could manually type in the new URL, whereas this new
                    browser allowed users to simply click the link directly to
                    get to the desired page.

                    "To be sure, Mosaic deserves credit for tackling two
                    problems. First, earlier browsers were troublesome to get up
                    and running, while Mosaic was a lot easier, thanks largely
                    to [NCSA developer Eric] Bina's programming skill. Second,
                    Mosaic was the first published browser that automatically
                    displayed pictures along with text, as in the pages of a
                    magazine layout or an illustrated book. That was important
                    because later on it would be the proliferation of pretty
                    pictures that transformed that Web from the domain of
                    scientists and hackers to a cultural phenomenon that
                    captured the interest of the masses."

                    a deal with Heirloom Carbon, a startup that has developed a
                    process for using limestone to capture carbon to fight
                    climate change. The technique could contribute to
                    Microsoft's ongoing attempt to become carbon-negative.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Limestone naturally absorbs carbon over many years, but
                    Heirloom's method accelerates the process. The company uses
                    a kiln powered by renewable energy to heat crushed limestone
                    to around 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit, which separates it into
                    carbon dioxide and calcium oxide. Adding water to the
                    calcium oxide allows it to absorb sufficient amounts of
                    carbon within days, after which Heirloom re-inserts it into
                    the kiln to restart the cycle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although the technology is proven, the maximum scale at
                    which it remains cost-effective is unclear. Another issue
                    facing all carbon capture methods is storing the substance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Regardless of the limestone method's effectiveness, it
                    will likely need to complement other carbon capture
                    technologies that Microsoft is

                    company also said that by 2050, it wants to remove all of
                    the carbon it has ever emitted since its 1975 founding.

                    [...] A majority of viewers of the potentially harmful
                    channels were subscribers to the type of channel in
                    question: 61% subscribers for alternative channels and 55%
                    for extremist channels. Almost all subscribed either to the
                    channel in question or another one like it: 93% for
                    alternative channels and 85% for extremist channels.

                  <p>
                    Viewing time data showed that a tiny percentage of people
                    were responsible for most of the time participants spent
                    watching potentially harmful channels. Specifically, 1.7% of
                    participants were responsible for 80% of time spent on
                    alternative channels while only 0.6% of participants were
                    responsible for 80% of the time spent on extremist channels.

                  <p>
                    The researchers also found that people who scored high in
                    hostile sexism and racial resentment were more likely to
                    visit videos from alternative and extremist channels.

                    [...] "What really stands out is the correlation between
                    content subscribers' prior levels of hostile sexism and more
                    time spent watching videos from alternative and extremist
                    channels," says Nyhan. "We interpret that relationship as
                    suggesting that people are seeking this content out."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By contrast, the researchers found that recommendations to
                    alternative and extremist channel videos were very rare and
                    that "rabbit hole"-type events were only observed a handful
                    of times during the study period.

                    Since its release in 1993, id Software's DOOM franchise has
                    become one of modern gaming's most easily recognizable IPs.
                    The series has sold more than 10 million copies to date and
                    spawned myriad RPG spinoffs, film adaptations and even a
                    couple tabletop board games. But the first game's debut
                    turned out to be a close thing, id Software cofounder John
                    Romero describes in an excerpt from his new book DOOM GUY:
                    Life in First Person. With a mere month before DOOM was
                    scheduled for release in December 1993, the iD team found
                    itself still polishing and tweaking lead programmer John
                    Carmack's novel peer-to-peer multiplayer architecture,
                    ironing out level designs — at a time when the studio's
                    programmers were also its QA team — and introducing
                    everybody's favorite killer synonym to the gamer lexicon.

                    the state of California over a law that requires companies
                    to disclose details about their content moderation
                    practices. The law, known as AB 587, requires social media
                    companies to publish information about their handling of
                    hate speech, extremism, misinformation and other issues, as

                    Lawyers for X argue that the law is unconstitutional and
                    will lead to censorship. It “has both the purpose and likely
                    effect of pressuring companies such as X Corp. to remove,
                    demonetize, or deprioritize constitutionally-protected
                    speech,” the company wrote in the

                      >lawsuit</a
                    >. “The true intent of AB 587 is to pressure social media
                    platforms to ‘eliminate’ certain constitutionally-protected
                    content viewed by the State as problematic.”

                  <p>
                    [...] At the same time, AB 587's backers have said it’s
                    necessary to increase the transparency of major platforms.
                    “If @X has nothing to hide, then they should have no

                    again — running afoul of the FTC. There have been numerous
                    reports over the last several days of ads appearing in
                    users’ timelines without being labeled as such,

                    mistakenly believe the platform is showing posts from
                    accounts they don’t follow in their following timeline, the
                    issue also risks stirring up more regulatory trouble with

                    It’s unclear if the unlabeled ads are the result of a bug or
                    an intentional change by the company. X, which no longer has
                    a functioning communications department, didn’t respond to a
                    request for comment.

                    weren’t around when the DC-X flew. For example, the engine

                    natural gas is net carbon-negative, because you’re removing
                    the methane that would otherwise have been dumped into the

                    New Frontier could also take advantage of the work that’s
                    being done to foster the return of commercial supersonic
                    flight — including

                    If New Frontier’s vision becomes a reality, its hypersonic

                    cargo delivery, but for intercontinental passenger travel as

                    The team found that thermal moonquakes occur with the
                    regularity of clockwork, every morning and afternoon. The
                    latter are the result of the Sun leaving its peak position
                    in the sky, allowing the lunar surface to begin to cool off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the team's artificial intelligence model revealed
                    that the seismic activity detected in the morning has a
                    different profile — and are not regular thermal moonquakes
                    at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using the data from the seismometer array to triangulate the
                    source of the morning quakes, Husker and his team found that
                    they were coming from the left-behind descent stage of the
                    Apollo 17 lunar module.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Seismological studies of the Moon are — as on Earth —
                    also a great way to get a glimpse of the structure beneath
                    the surface. This is because seismic waves travel at
                    different speeds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As Husker adds, using moonquakes, "we will hopefully be able
                    to map out the subsurface cratering and to look for
                    deposits."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Husker continued: "There are also certain regions in
                    craters at the Moon's South Pole that never see sunlight;
                    they are permanently shadowed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If we could put up a few seismometers there, we could look
                    for water ice that may be trapped in the subsurface. Seismic
                    waves travel slower through water."

              <p>Spotify used to launder drug money?</p>
              <p>
                On a series of articles gang members, criminals and
                investigators from the police tell how Spotify is used to
                launder drug money.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    "I can say with 100 percent certainty that this goes on. I
                    have been involved in it myself," SvD quoted one anonymous
                    gang member as saying.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said his gang began using the music streaming giant
                    Spotify for money laundering in 2019, around the time
                    Swedish gangster rap became popular in the country and
                    started winning music awards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We have paid people who have done this for us
                    systematically," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Describing the process, he said the gangs would convert
                    their dirty cash to bitcoin, then used the cryptocurrency to
                    pay people who sold fake streams on Spotify, which is a
                    Swedish company.
                  </p>

              <p>
                Spotify is feigning ignorance. They somehow missed that this has
                been going on for at least four years.
              </p>

                Do other entertainment services have the same problems in the
                modern digital world?

                    Researchers at Iowa State University found a simple
                    intervention could help. During a two-week experiment with
                    230 college students, half were asked to limit their social
                    media usage to 30 minutes a day and received automated,
                    daily reminders. They scored significantly lower for
                    anxiety, depression, loneliness and fear of missing out at
                    the end of the experiment compared to the control group.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They also scored higher for "positive affect," which the
                    researchers describe as "the tendency to experience positive
                    emotions described with words such as 'excited' and
                    'proud.'" Essentially, they had a brighter outlook on life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It surprised me to find that participants' well-being did
                    not only improve in one dimension but in all of them. I was
                    excited to learn that such a simple intervention of sending
                    a daily reminder can motivate people to change their
                    behavior and improve their social media habits." says

                    [...] Many of the participants in the ISU study commented
                    that the first few days of cutting back were challenging.
                    But after the initial push, one student felt more productive
                    and in tune with life. Others shared that they were getting
                    better sleep or spending more time with people in person.

                    [...] "We live in an age of anxiety. Lots of indicators show
                    that anxiety, depression, loneliness are all getting worse,
                    and that can make us feel helpless. But there are things we

                    Paying more attention to how much time we spend on social
                    media and setting measurable goals can help.

                    shortly after reentry,
                    <strong>at 10:42 a.m. ET Sept. 24. </strong>But four hours
                    before the package pierces Earth's atmosphere, flight
                    controllers will make a decision about whether to proceed
                    with the separation of the capsule from its spacecraft,
                    based on human safety, capsule survivability, and landing
                    accuracy criteria.

                    After the spacecraft releases the capsule about 63,000 miles
                    from Earth, it will travel through space for about 20
                    minutes before firing its thrusters to avoid Earth. At that
                    point, it will begin

                        encouraging users to do things in a particular way and
                        discouraging them from other things, such as putting

                    learning to the data they collected, the rate of correctly

                    The chairman of TSMC admitted that the ongoing short supply
                    of compute GPUs for artificial intelligence (AI) and
                    high-performance computing (HPC) applications is caused
                    by constraints of its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS)
                    packaging capacity. This shortage is expected to persist for
                    around 18 months due to rising demand for generative AI
                    applicationsand relatively slow expansion of CoWoS capacity
                    at TSMC.

                    "It is not the shortage of AI chips, it is the shortage of
                    our CoWoS capacity," said Mark Liu, the chairman of TSMC,

                    think this is a temporary phenomenon. After our expansion of
                    [advanced chip packaging capacity], it should be alleviated

                    including Nvidia's A100 and H100 compute GPUs that are
                    integral to AI tools like ChatGPT and are predominantly used
                    in AI data centers. These processors, just like solutions
                    from other players like AMD, AWS, and Google, use HBM memory
                    (which is essential for high
                    bandwidth and proper functioning of extensive AI language
                    models) and CoWoS packaging, which puts additional strain on
                    TSMC's advanced packaging facilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Liu said that demand for CoWoS surged unexpectedly earlier
                    this year, tripling year-over-year, leading to the current
                    supply constraints. TSMC recognizes that demand
                    for generative AI services is growing and so is demand for
                    appropriate hardware, so it is speeding up expansion of
                    CoWoS capacity to meet demand for compute GPUs as well as
                    specialized AI accelerators and processors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At present, the company is installing additional tools for
                    CoWoS at its existing advanced packaging facilities, but
                    this takes time and the company expects its CoWoS capacity
                    to double only by the end of 2024.

                    "Acute coffee consumption decreased the functional
                    connectivity between brain regions of the default mode
                    network, a network that is associated with self-referential
                    processes when participants are at rest," said Dr Maria
                    Picó-Pérez of Jaume I University, first author. [...] In
                    simple words, the subjects were more ready for action and
                    alert to external stimuli after having coffee."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Taking into account that some of the effects that we found
                    were reproduced by caffeine, we could expect other
                    caffeinated drinks to share some of the effects," added
                    Picó-Pérez. "However, others were specific for coffee
                    drinking, driven by factors such as the particular smell and
                    taste of the drink, or the psychological expectation
                    associated with consuming that drink."

                  <p>
                    The authors pointed out that it is possible that the
                    experience of drinking coffee without caffeine could cause
                    these benefits: this study could not differentiate the
                    effects of the experience alone from the experience combined
                    with the caffeine. There is also a hypothesis that the
                    benefits coffee-drinkers claim could be due to the relief of
                    withdrawal symptoms, which this study did not test.

                    Some coastal communities have proved aggressively resistant
                    to increasing density, boosting affordable housing and
                    allowing more development. That has left inland exurbs as
                    drivers of new housing, even though they are significantly
                    hotter and require long commutes to job centers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We likely need more policy to better integrate the state's
                    housing affordability policies in concert with our climate
                    strategies," Subin said.

                  <p>
                    "Compact development near the coasts," he said, can "reduce
                    emissions across sectors." In these types of development,
                    residents drive less, building energy use is lower—partially
                    due to less extreme heat—and undeveloped land inland can be
                    left undisturbed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Subin said California's coastal cities still have plenty of
                    room to grow. "It's not a technical limitation, it's a
                    policy choice that we have chosen to reserve much of our
                    [coastal] cities for surface parking lots, for exclusive
                    single-family home zoning," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Subin said that adding density to already existing
                    cities in the North Coast could make sense, but in terms of
                    creating a planned mega-city, there's "not a great track
                    record for that around the world."

                    In a new report, the federal department charged with
                    analyzing how efficiently US taxpayer dollars are spent, the
                    Government Accountability Office, says NASA lacks
                    transparency on the true costs of its Space Launch System
                    rocket program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Published on Thursday, the new report (<a
                      href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105609.pdf"
                      >see .pdf</a
                    >) examines the billions of dollars spent by NASA on the
                    development of the massive rocket, which made a successful
                    debut launch in late 2022 with the Artemis I mission.
                    Surprisingly, as part of the reporting process, NASA
                    officials admitted the rocket was too expensive to support
                    its lunar exploration efforts as part of the Artemis
                    program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Senior NASA officials told GAO that at current cost levels,
                    the SLS program is unaffordable," the new report states.<br />[...]<br />NASA
                    recently said that it is working with the primary contractor
                    of the SLS rocket's main engines, Aerojet, to reduce the
                    cost of each engine by 30 percent, down to $70.5 million by
                    the end of this decade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, NASA's inspector general, Paul Martin,
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/05/a-new-report-finds-nasa-has-spent-an-obscene-amount-of-money-on-sls-propulsion/"
                      >said this claim was dubious</a
                    >. According to Martin, when calculating the projected cost
                    savings of the new RS-25 engines, NASA and Aerojet only
                    included material, engineering support, and touch labor,
                    while project management and overhead costs are excluded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And even at $70.5 million, these engines are very, very far
                    from being affordable compared to the existing US commercial
                    market for powerful rocket engines. Blue Origin manufactures
                    an engine of comparable power and size, the BE-4, for less
                    than $20 million. And SpaceX is seeking to push the
                    similarly powerful Raptor rocket engine costs even lower, to
                    less than $1 million per engine.

                    we expected," SpaceX CEO Elon Musk joked with reporters in
                    the wake of the late April test launch. Per the a report

                    field that saw concrete chunks flung more than 2,600 feet
                    from the launchpad, a 3.5-acre wildfire and "a plume cloud
                    of pulverized concrete that deposited material up to 6.5
                    miles northwest of the pad site.”

                    "Corrective actions include redesigns of vehicle hardware to
                    prevent leaks and fires, redesign of the launch pad to
                    increase its robustness, incorporation of additional reviews
                    in the design process, additional analysis and testing of
                    safety critical systems and components including the
                    Autonomous Flight Safety System, and the application of
                    additional change control practices," the FAA release reads.
                    Furthermore, the FAA says that SpaceX will have to not only
                    complete that list but also apply for and receive a
                    modification to its existing license "that addresses all
                    safety, environmental and other applicable regulatory
                    requirements prior to the next Starship launch." In short,
                    SpaceX has reached the "finding out" part.

                    [...] "SpaceX is also implementing a full suite of system
                    performance upgrades unrelated to any issues observed during
                    the first flight test," the blog reads. Those improvements
                    include a new hot-stage separation system which will more
                    effectively decouple the first and second stages, a new
                    electronic "Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system" for its
                    Raptor heavy rockets, and "significant upgrades" to the
                    orbital launch mount and pad system which just so happened
                    to have failed in the first test but is, again, completely
                    unrelated to this upgrade. Whether those improvements
                    overlap with the 63 that the FAA is imposing, could not be
                    confirmed at the time of publication as the FAA had not
                    publically released them.

                    an "all-in-one solution for customers that remains unmatched
                    in the marketplace." A large problem, among more
                    run-of-the-mill crypto economy problems such as "lack of
                    operational and spending oversight" and "regulatory issues,"
                    is the fact that it lost access to a physical wallet it was
                    keeping a tens of millions of dollars in, and cannot get
                    back into it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In March of 2018, the Company created cold-storage wallets
                    for purposes of maintaining cryptocurrency assets that
                    included ETH, BTC, and ERC-20 compliant cryptocurrencies,"
                    the company wrote in its filing. It called one of these
                    wallets the "98f Wallet," because its address ended in
                    "98f."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To enhance security, the Company set up the 98f Wallet so
                    that those who can 'sign' (i.e., approve) transactions would
                    need to be in physical possession of hand-held Trezor or
                    Ledger hardware devices," the filing says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The filing then states that, if the wallet is lost, most
                    users create "seed phrases" that serve as backup codes that
                    allow people to get into the wallet virtually: "Many users
                    store seed phrases on hard copies of handwritten paper,
                    images, and pictures. If a user loses both the hardware
                    device and the seed phrases, it is virtually impossible for
                    that user to regain access to the digital wallet."
                  </p>
                  <p>You can probably see where this is going.</p>

                  <p>
                    Over time, Mercola amassed 300,000 subscribers to a YouTube
                    channel that "garnered 50 million views" by boosting
                    professionally made videos that linked to his website,
                    "which promotes natural health and provides health articles,
                    optimal wellness products, medical news, and a free
                    newsletter."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers and regulators described Mercola's background to
                    The New York Times a little differently. They claimed that
                    he was at one point the "most influential spreader of
                    coronavirus misinformation" and profited "from misleading
                    claims about Covid-19 vaccines."<br />[...]<br />His attempt
                    to appeal YouTube's decision was denied, according to
                    Beeler's order. At that point, YouTube told Mercola that
                    after reviewing his channel "carefully," YouTube "confirmed
                    that it violates our Community Guidelines."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We won't be putting your channel back up on YouTube," the
                    email said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With no other option to fight back, Mercola sued, alleging
                    that YouTube had failed to provide "advance notice of the
                    vaccine-misinformation policy before terminating the channel
                    and account," warn Mercola of the termination or act fairly
                    and in good faith. He also claimed that YouTube failed to
                    give him access to his content, which he claimed that
                    YouTube's terms of use required. Finally, he said that
                    YouTube had been unjustly enriched for retaining his content
                    and converting it exclusively to YouTube's use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Beeler rejected all these arguments, agreeing with YouTube
                    that there was no breach of contract, no damages should be
                    awarded, and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act
                    barred Mercola's claims.

                    are already being actively prosecuted, we are concerned that
                    AI is creating a new frontier for abuse that makes such

                    Midjourney, DALL-E, and Adobe Firefly all have built-in
                    filters that bar the creation of pornographic content.)

                    Microsoft is alerting users and system administrators that
                    Windows will soon phase out support for older TLS
                    specifications. TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
                    <a
                      href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-message-center#3153"

                    >
                    in upcoming Windows releases, as announced in the Windows
                    message center. This change is only for future versions of
                    Windows and newer Windows 11 releases, as indicated by
                    Redmond. It applies to both client and server editions, but
                    current versions of Windows will remain unaffected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] TLS 1.0 (introduced in 1999) and TLS 1.1 (introduced
                    in 2006) have long been outperformed by TLS 1.2 and 1.3.
                    Modern internet software's TLS implementations are
                    engineered to attempt a connection using the highest
                    available protocol version. Data indicates that the usage of
                    TLS 1.0 and 1.1 is relatively low currently. Microsoft is
                    evidently striving to enhance the security of the Windows
                    platform by promoting the adoption of contemporary
                    protocols.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Consequently, starting with the Windows 11 Insider Preview
                    builds set for release in September 2023, TLS versions 1.0
                    and 1.1 will be disabled by default. This change will also
                    be seen in Windows 12 and subsequent versions. Microsoft has
                    conducted tests on TLS deprecation and identified a
                    "non-exhaustive" list of applications that are dependent on
                    TLS 1.0 or 1.1. This list features older versions of SQL
                    Server, Turbo Tax, BlueStacks, ACDSee Photo Studio, among
                    others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft clarified that most contemporary applications
                    support TLS 1.2 or higher versions, so the majority of users
                    should face no issues. However, if an application does
                    encounter problems, forthcoming updates for Windows 11 and
                    Windows 12 will offer an option to reactivate the older
                    protocols through a modification to the System Registry.

                    Today, the Mozilla Foundation published its analysis of how
                    well automakers handle the privacy of data collected by
                    their connected cars, and the results will be unlikely to
                    surprise any regular reader of Ars Technica. The researchers
                    <a
                      href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/"
                      >were horrified by their findings</a
                    >, stating that "cars are the worst product category we have
                    ever reviewed for privacy."<br />[...]<br />For example,
                    Nissan's privacy policy says it can collect "sensitive
                    personal information, including driver's license number,
                    national or state identification number, citizenship status,
                    immigration status, race, national origin, religious or
                    philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, sexual activity,
                    precise geolocation, health diagnosis data, and genetic
                    information," although it's unlikely your car knows whether
                    you're getting busy in the back seat. While this might be
                    technically possible with a car fitted with a camera-based
                    driver-monitoring system, Nissan's privacy policy notes the
                    data source for the quoted paragraph as "direct contact with
                    users and Nissan employees."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (Although more sophisticated driver-monitoring systems that
                    claim to detect emotional states

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mozilla found plenty more to worry about. Eighty-four
                    percent of the brands they analyzed said they can share your
                    data, and 76 percent said they can sell it. And more than
                    half say they'll share data with the government and law
                    enforcement by request.

                    >, Guild president Fran Drescher said AI is partly to blame
                    for the impasse. The statement explains that plenty of work
                    covered by the Interactive Media Agreement is "performance
                    capture" in which artists, some of them stunt performers,
                    "provide digitally captured performances used to give
                    expressive movement to video game characters."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using AI to replace those performances "poses an enormous
                    threat to these artists' professions," the Guild asserts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Guild wants AI protections for its members, and an
                    initial wage rise of 11 percent dated to the expiration of
                    the current deal, plus four percent increases in the second
                    and third years of a new deal. The Guild argues those hikes
                    are "necessary for members' wages to keep up with
                    inflation."

                    Authorizing the strike doesn't mean it will happen – the
                    Guild's announcement simply means members head into their
                    next round of negotiations, from late September, with
                    approval to withdraw labor.

                    [...] The concurrent strikes by actors and writers are
                    already kicking holes in broadcasters' and streamers'
                    schedules. Some shows have been suspended indefinitely and
                    others – like the planned Apple TV series Metropolis, based
                    on the classic sci-fi film – have been cancelled outright.

                    If games suffer the same fate, that could make for a poor
                    holiday season – the peak sales period for game publishers –
                    if not this year, then perhaps in 2024 given the long
                    development cycle required to produce premium games.

                    While the supplier, Wolverhampton-based Zaun, said it
                    believed that no classified information was downloaded,
                    reports indicated that attackers were able to obtain data
                    that could be used to gain access to some of the UK's most
                    sensitive military and research sites.

                    The LockBit Ransom group conducted the attack on the
                    company's network, and Zaun admitted the group may have
                    exfiltrated 10GB of data. The company also confessed that
                    the attack might have reached its server beyond the Windows
                    7 entry point.

                    [...] Zaun specializes in high-security perimeter fencing.
                    It isn't a government-approved security contractor, although
                    is approved for government use via the Centre for the
                    Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI). The fact it
                    has fallen victim to a cyberattack and had data downloaded
                    is a reminder for enterprises and organizations to be
                    vigilant regarding every link in the supply chain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company boasts: "All our fencing systems can be designed
                    and manufactured with a wide variety of security additions,
                    including toppings and detection technology to complete your
                    perimeter." Unless, it appears, your perimeter is running
                    some distinctly outdated kit.

                    [...] Paul Brucciani, Cyber Security Advisor at WithSecure,
                    noted the success of LockBit, saying: "The significance of
                    this attack is that by undermining IT security, it is also
                    possible to undermine the physical security of its [the
                    supplier] customers."

                    Daily also noted that, in terms of food production,
                    diversified farms are not necessarily lower yielding than
                    intensive agriculture. "This is a recent assumption that is

                    farmland would not support a meaningful amount of
                    biodiversity," said Daily. In this case, not only are
                    diversified farms themselves providing habitat, they connect
                    otherwise fragmented forested areas.

                    creating protected areas separate from human activities, and
                    see more and more how much potential there is outside of
                    forests. The forests are key—we need them, of course. But in
                    addition to that, I'm always surprised by how important

                    Gigabyte has released new firmware and an updated version of
                    the Gigabyte Control Center (GCC) software for the company's

                    memory modules. Fortunately, the issue only affects the
                    information on the SPD and will not damage the integrity of
                    the memory modules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There were some user reports on the Baidu Tieba community in
                    China about persistent memory issues with Gigabyte
                    motherboards based on Intel's 600- and 700-series chipsets.
                    After a month of usage,
                    <a href="https://tieba.baidu.com/p/8568000894">one user</a>
                    stated how his Z790 Aorus Elite AX motherboard stopped
                    detecting one of the DDR5 memory modules. When he finally
                    got it to recognize the memory module, it was showing as
                    having a capacity of 384GB, which was hilarious and scary at
                    the same time. Later, one of the memory kit's XMP profiles
                    disappeared, and then the DDR5-6000 profile had its timings
                    replaced to 1-36-104-194. According to the user, he had
                    replaced the "faulty" memory times, but the outcome was the
                    same. The problem was erratic. Sometimes, it would present
                    itself after a month, sometimes after a week, or after a
                    couple of days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another

                    reported similar behaviors on his system. He constantly
                    suffered from system crashes and noted that after one of the
                    incidents, his memory lost the AMD EXPO profile. In another
                    episode, the motherboard corrupted the DDR5-6800 XMP profile
                    with ludicrous timings, such as 34-153-0-0.

                    The Chinese netizens had labeled the problem as the
                    notorious "burning memory issue" because, at first, many
                    thought that Gigabyte motherboards were burning up and
                    killing the DDR5 memory modules since the system got to a
                    point where it wouldn't boot properly. It may sound like an
                    overreaction at the time, but luckily, the issue only
                    botches the memory timings and not the DRAM voltage. If it
                    did, the result would have been different. As per Gigabyte,
                    the memory should be fine. It's just that the SPD is messed
                    up, and obviously, the wrong parameters prevent the system
                    from posting correctly.

                    inevitably be abused and exploited to compromise the privacy
                    and security of all iCloud users. This week, a new child
                    safety group known as Heat Initiative told Apple that it is
                    organizing a campaign to demand that the company "detect,
                    report, and remove" child sexual abuse material from iCloud
                    and offer more tools for users to report CSAM to the
                    company.

                  <p>
                    Today, in a rare move, Apple responded to Heat Initiative,
                    outlining its reasons for abandoning the development of its
                    iCloud CSAM scanning feature and instead focusing on a

                    to develop an iCloud CSAM scanning feature. Gardner said in
                    an email to CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday, which Apple also
                    shared with WIRED, that Heat Initiative found Apple's
                    decision to kill the feature "disappointing."<br />[...]<br />Apple
                    maintains that, ultimately, even its own well-intentioned
                    design could not be adequately safeguarded in practice, and
                    that on-device nudity detections for features like Messages,
                    FaceTime, AirDrop, the Photo picker are a safer
                    alternatives. Apple has also begun offering an application
                    programming interface (API) for its Communication Safety
                    features so third-party developers can incorporate them into
                    their apps. Apple says that the communication platform
                    Discord is integrating the features and that app makers
                    broadly have been enthusiastic about adopting them.

                    Rand emphasizes that the study results occupy a middle
                    ground; microtargeting is probably not the seemingly
                    overpowering force that people fear it to be, but targeted
                    political ads still have an advantage much of the time.

                    "In terms of the implications for political advertising, it
                    certainly seems like targeting is often going to be a good
                    idea, and if you're not doing that, you may be leaving
                    persuasive power on the table," Rand says. "At the same
                    time, it's clearly not mind control."

                    In that context, it makes total sense to think about how to
                    manage the devices connected to your systems and to put in
                    place the software, security, and user education it takes to
                    protect your business environments. The cost of device
                    management is relatively negligible compared to the
                    consequences of a

                    These findings were based upon oxygen isotopes (the same
                    element with different atomic masses), whereby the warmer
                    conditions cause the evaporation of lighter <sup>16</sup>O,
                    leaving the water enriched in heavier <sup>18</sup>O which
                    is then incorporated into the shells of organisms living in
                    the ocean, such as single-celled foraminifera.

                    [...] Through this work, the research team identified nine
                    glacial termination events, with the three marked by an
                    asterisk representing partial termination, while the
                    remainder are fully changing from glacial to interglacial
                    conditions. The precession cycles are noticeably different
                    between the glacial terminations, which Hobart and
                    colleagues suggest may be explained by the competing
                    influence of obliquity, as well as variable ice sheet size
                    at the beginning of each cycle. Therefore, they calculate
                    the duration between the cycles ranging from 90,400 and
                    115,500 years, with the more distinct changes in precession
                    a clear indicator of the sensitivity of Late Pleistocene ice
                    sheets.

                    capability that military leaders have prioritized over the
                    last decade. In that time, Pentagon officials say there has

                    "There are several critical issues with current evaluation
                    techniques for large language models," says Natalie Shapira,
                    a computer scientist at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan,
                    Israel. "It creates the illusion that they have greater
                    capabilities than what truly exists."

                  <p>
                    That's why a growing number of researchers—computer
                    scientists, cognitive scientists, neuroscientists,
                    linguists—want to overhaul the way they are assessed,
                    calling for more rigorous and exhaustive evaluation. Some
                    think that the practice of scoring machines on human tests
                    is wrongheaded, period, and should be ditched.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "People have been giving human intelligence tests—IQ tests
                    and so on—to machines since the very beginning of AI," says
                    Melanie Mitchell, an artificial-intelligence researcher at
                    the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. "The issue throughout
                    has been what it means when you test a machine like this. It
                    doesn't mean the same thing that it means for a human."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "There is a long history of developing methods to test
                    the human mind," says Laura Weidinger, a senior research
                    scientist at Google DeepMind. "With large language models
                    producing text that seems so human-like, it is tempting to
                    assume that human psychology tests will be useful for
                    evaluating them. But that's not true: human psychology tests
                    rely on many assumptions that may not hold for large
                    language models."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Webb is aware of the issues he waded into. "I share the
                    sense that these are difficult questions," he says. He notes
                    that despite scoring better than undergrads on certain
                    tests, GPT-3 produced absurd results on others. For example,
                    it failed a version of an analogical reasoning test about
                    physical objects that developmental psychologists sometimes
                    give to kids.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A lot of these tests—questions and answers—are online,
                    says Webb: "Many of them are almost certainly in GPT-3's and
                    GPT-4's training data, so I think we really can't conclude
                    much of anything."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The performance of large language models is brittle.
                    Among people, it is safe to assume that someone who scores
                    well on a test would also do well on a similar test. That's
                    not the case with large language models: a small tweak to a
                    test can drop an A grade to an F.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In general, AI evaluation has not been done in such a way
                    as to allow us to actually understand what capabilities
                    these models have," says Lucy Cheke, a psychologist at the
                    University of Cambridge, UK. "It's perfectly reasonable to
                    test how well a system does at a particular task, but it's
                    not useful to take that task and make claims about general
                    abilities."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The assumption that cognitive or academic tests
                    designed for humans serve as accurate measures of LLM
                    capability stems from a tendency to anthropomorphize models
                    and align their evaluation with human standards," says
                    Shapira. "This assumption is misguided."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The trouble is that nobody knows exactly how large
                    language models work. Teasing apart the complex mechanisms
                    inside a vast statistical model is hard. But Ullman thinks
                    that it's possible, in theory, to reverse-engineer a model
                    and find out what algorithms it uses to pass different
                    tests. "I could more easily see myself being convinced if
                    someone developed a technique for figuring out what these
                    things have actually learned," he says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I think that the fundamental problem is that we keep
                    focusing on test results rather than how you pass the
                    tests."

                  <p>
                    Shooter video game Call Of Duty has started using AI to
                    listen out for hate speech during online matches.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Publisher Activision said the moderation tool, which uses
                    machine learning technology, would be able to identify
                    discriminatory language and harassment in real time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Machine learning is what allows AI to learn and adapt on the
                    fly without explicit human instruction, instead using
                    algorithms and the data it's taught with to recognise
                    patterns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The tool being rolled out in Call Of Duty, called ToxMod, is
                    made by a company called Modulate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Activision's chief technology officer Michael Vance said it
                    would help make the game "a fun, fair and welcoming
                    experience for all players".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Activision said its existing tools, including the
                    ability for gamers to report others and the automatic
                    monitoring of text chat and offensive usernames, had already
                    seen one million accounts given communications restrictions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Call Of Duty's code of conduct bans bullying and harassment,
                    including insults based on race, sexual orientation, gender
                    identity, age, culture, faith, and country of origin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mr Vance said ToxMod allows the company's moderation efforts
                    to be scaled up significantly by categorising toxic
                    behaviour based on its severity, before a human decides
                    whether action should be taken.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Players will not be able to opt out of having the AI listen
                    in, unless they completely disable in-game voice chat.

                    [...] The U.S. government has restricted sales of Nvidia's
                    high-performance compute GPUs to the Middle East and some
                    other countries, the company said in a regulatory filing
                    this week. One of the reasons why the Biden administration
                    decided to require an export license on Nvidia's A100 and
                    H100 products and servers on their base is to thwart China's
                    AI development by preventing the GPUs from being resold to
                    China, reports <a

                    "During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the U.S.
                    government informed us of an additional licensing
                    requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined
                    to certain customers and other regions, including some
                    countries in the Middle East," a <a

                    China not subject to the license requirements, such as our
                    A800 or H800 offerings."

                  <p>
                    The affected chips, namely the H100 and A100 models, are
                    already restricted for sale in China and Russia, which is
                    why Nvidia has developed H800 and A800 models with reduced
                    performance to sell in China. Although Nvidia disclosed
                    these new limitations in a U.S. regulatory filing, the
                    company did not reveal which countries in the Middle East
                    are specifically impacted by these controls.

                    Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been strengthening their
                    AI prowess in the recent years, which is why they
                    are significant purchasers of Nvidia's chips. Saudi Arabia
                    and the UAE have been in talks with China to deepen their
                    collaborations. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia even entered into
                    a strategic alliance with China, committing to work
                    collaboratively on artificial intelligence projects.
