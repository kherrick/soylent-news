                    <a href="https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~sullivan/"
                      >John Sullivan</a

                    >
                    to be had. Bubble problems make sense in any dimension, and
                    Sullivan found that as long as the number of volumes you're
                    trying to enclose is at most one greater than the dimension,
                    there's a particular way to enclose the volumes that is, in
                    a certain sense, more beautiful than any other—a sort of
                    shadow of a perfectly symmetric bubble cluster on a sphere.
                    This shadow cluster, he conjectured, should be the one that
                    minimizes surface area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the decade that followed, mathematicians wrote a series
                    of groundbreaking papers proving Sullivan's conjecture when
                    you're trying to enclose only two volumes. Here, the
                    solution is the familiar double bubble you may have blown in
                    the park on a sunny day, made of two spherical pieces with a
                    flat or spherical wall between them (depending on whether
                    the two bubbles have the same or different volumes).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But proving Sullivan's conjecture for three volumes, the
                    mathematician
                    <a href="https://math.williams.edu/morgan/">Frank Morgan</a>
                    of Williams College

                    in 2007, "could well take another hundred years."

                  <p>
                    Now, mathematicians have been spared that long wait—and have
                    gotten far more than just a solution to the triple bubble
                    problem. In a
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09102">paper</a> posted
                    online in May 2022, Milman and
                    <a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/jneeman/"
                      >Joe Neeman</a
                    >, of the University of Texas, Austin, have proved
                    Sullivan's conjecture for triple bubbles in dimensions three
                    and up and quadruple bubbles in dimensions four and up, with
                    a follow-up paper on quintuple bubbles in dimensions five
                    and up in the works.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And when it comes to six or more bubbles, Milman and Neeman
                    have shown that the best cluster must have many of the key
                    attributes of Sullivan's candidate, potentially starting
                    mathematicians on the road to proving the conjecture for
                    these cases too. "My impression is that they have grasped
                    the essential structure behind the Sullivan conjecture,"
                    said
                    <a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/maggi/index.html"

                  <p>
                    Milman and Neeman's central theorem is "monumental," Morgan
                    wrote in an email. "It's a brilliant accomplishment with
                    lots of new ideas."

                    A paradigm-shifting study published today in
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01307-6"
                      >Nature Neuroscience</a

                    shows that, just like humans, monkeys are capable of complex
                    deliberation and careful decision-making. The study is first
                    to show that monkeys can think deeply about a problem and
                    consider combinations of factors such as costs, consequences
                    and constraints. In doing so, monkeys find optimal outcomes
                    rather than impulsively reaching for the first available
                    option.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Humans are not the only animals capable of slow and
                    thoughtful deliberation," said senior author William
                    Stauffer, Ph.D., assistant professor of neurobiology at the
                    <a href="https://www.medschool.pitt.edu/"
                      >University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine</a
                    >. "Our work shows that monkeys have a rich mental state
                    that renders them capable of intelligent thinking. It's a
                    new paradigm for studying the neurophysiological basis for
                    deliberative thought."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Several decades ago, Nobel Prize laureate Daniel
                    Kahneman, Ph.D., revolutionized the field of behavioral
                    economics with Prospect Theory. In his book, "Thinking Fast
                    and Slow," he postulated that humans employ two distinct
                    systems of thinking — one nearly instantaneous that happens
                    automatically, and the other much slower, conscious, logical
                    reasoning that requires more mental effort.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kahneman dubbed the first, effortless, type of thinking as
                    'fast' and the second as 'slow.' Slow, effortful thinking
                    enables us to write music, develop scientific hypothesis and
                    balance our checkbooks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As it turns out, the slow thinking of humans is not unique.

                    [...] The coalition also argues there is no evidence of the
                    need for such an extraordinary network fee, claiming: "The
                    concept of the contribution stems from large internet
                    providers proposing a favourable solution for a problem that
                    has not been identified, justified nor clarified. This
                    'solution' would harm and discriminate against every other
                    part of European business and consumer good, to the single
                    benefit only of large telecom providers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They also raise antitrust concerns, suggesting additional
                    payments made direct to telco incumbents would only crank up
                    the "profitability gap" that already exists between
                    traditional telecom operators vs smaller alternative
                    operators and MVNOs; and vs other content services providers
                    which rely on telcos' networks to provide "vital competition
                    and choice for consumers", as their statement puts it.

                    The prospect of the Commission taking steps to cement Big
                    Telco's grip on connectivity does seems at odds with recent
                    moves by the Commission to regulate Big Tech's market
                    muscle, under the incoming

                    epicenter.works (another signatory to the coalition
                    statement), takes direct aim at Breton, writing in another
                    supporting statement that: "Never in the last decade has the
                    European Commission appeared so captured by special
                    interests and shown such disrespect for its own due
                    diligence principles. Former France Telecom CEO and current
                    commissioner Thierry Breton seems determined to sacrifice
                    consumer choice, competition and the open internet for the
                    profits of the telecom industry."

                    WTF?! Now you can bypass your hard drive and store your
                    whole operating system in your VRAM (should you want to).
                    Well-known Windows modder NTDEV has demonstrated how, and
                    it's surprisingly painless.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Step one is to create a RAM drive in your GPU's memory. A
                    VRAM drive, if you will. There's an open-source tool that
                    can do it for you called
                    <a href="https://github.com/prsyahmi/GpuRamDrive"
                      >GpuRamDrive</a
                    >. It only takes a couple clicks but the tool was abandoned
                    before it reached stability, so you might need to try it a
                    few times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Step two is to use your pick of tools to create a virtual
                    machine. NTDEV used Windows' baked-in Hyper-V manager, which
                    is a simple yet powerful tool for spawning virtual machines
                    available to Windows 10 and 11 Pro, Education, and
                    Enterprise users. You'll need to change just a couple of
                    defaults in Hyper-V, and you can pick those out in NTDEV's
                    video.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you have an RTX 4090 or RX 7900 XTX or a GPU with more
                    than 20 GB of VRAM then you should be able to squeeze a
                    vanilla Windows 11 installation onto the VRAM drive you
                    created. If you didn't drop a grand on a new GPU this past
                    year, you'll have to use an alternate operating system with
                    less demanding storage requirements. NTDEV uses Tiny11, a
                    stripped-down version of Windows 11 that he created.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I can't think of a single reason why anyone would want
                    to run Windows 11 on their VRAM. And yet, it's astonishingly
                    practical: quick to set up and seemingly as fast and stable
                    as a regular virtual machine. Why not, then, I suppose?

                    The best way to get a better look at the cold gas was to
                    view the system in the infrared spectrum, so De turned to
                    observational data from the Palomar Observatory's infrared
                    camera, as well as archival data collected by NASA's
                    <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/neowise"
                      >NEOWISE telescope</a
                    >, which images the night sky in the infrared every six
                    months. That data showed that even after the optical light
                    had faded, there was still a strong infrared glow from all
                    that cold dust. Nine months before the brightening, NEOWISE
                    had picked up an infrared glow from dust in the system. And
                    data from the
                    <a
                      href="https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/gemini-observatory/gemini-south/"
                      >Gemini South Telescope</a
                    >
                    provided high-resolution observations enabling De
                    <em>et al</em>. to pinpoint the location of the outburst, as
                    well as measurements of the star's brightness over time,
                    free of contaminating data from nearby stars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All that data gave De three key pieces of evidence: cold gas
                    detected in the outburst, dust formed after the outburst
                    giving off an infrared glow, and an infrared brightening
                    several months before the outburst. De thought it must be
                    the signature of two stars merging, but the event was 100 to
                    1,000 times fainter than any such merger known. So
                    whatever ZTF SLRN-2020 swallowed had to be something a
                    thousand times less massive than the star, based on what is
                    currently known about stellar dynamics. The most likely
                    object was a planet: a gas giant roughly the size of
                    Jupiter.

                    [...] "One of the reasons we do astronomy in the first place
                    is to answer the questions: Where do we come from? And where
                    are we going," said De. "This particular discovery shows us
                    where we are going. It's a testament to our eventual state
                    in the Universe. All that we see around us, all that we've

                    tunnels. The Las Vegas Loop will now feature a total of 69
                    stations and 65 miles, or 104 kilometers, of tunnels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Boring Company tweeted the news yesterday evening,
                    following a meeting with the Clarke County Zoning Commission
                    yesterday morning. The Las Vegas Loop was set to feature a
                    combined 34 miles, or 55 kilometers, of tunnels and had
                    stations that predominantly ran along the Las Vegas Strip.
                    The Boring Company then asked in March to expand the Las
                    Vegas loop, with the newly approved expansion adding 18 new
                    stations and about 25 miles, 40 kilometers, of additional
                    tunnels, according to a tweet from the county's official
                    account yesterday.

                    reduce traffic trips from our surface street public

                    Attorney Stephanie Allen, representing the Boring Company,
                    told county commissioners at yesterday's meeting that the
                    Las Vegas loop currently has 2.2 miles constructed with 5
                    operational stops—four at the Las Vegas Convention Center
                    and one at Resorts World. Allen further told commissioners
                    that 1 million passengers have ridden through the network so
                    far, with peak ridership in one day reaching over 32,000.

                    "The more opportunities we have on this map, the more
                    opportunities for success with this system," Allen said
                    during the meeting.

                    The French regulator, which has taken a preliminary view
                    that Meta's practices are likely to break competition rules,
                    notes in a

                      href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/communiques-de-presse/verification-publicitaire-sur-internet-lautorite-de-la-concurrence-prononce"

                    that Adloox's last request to Meta, in August 2022, went
                    unanswered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The Authority considers that Meta's practices are likely to
                    constitute an abuse of a dominant position," the regulator
                    writes in a statement [translated from French using machine
                    translation]. "In light of the investigation, the Authority
                    considered that Meta is likely to hold a dominant position
                    on the French market for online advertising on social media
                    as well as on the broader market for online advertising not
                    linked to search. Given the importance of the advertising
                    investments made on Meta's platform, Meta is perceived as a
                    key partner for independent auditors."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Practices by Meta that the regulator is calling out as
                    likely to constitute an abuse of a dominant position are 1):
                    The lack of defined and transparent objective,
                    non-discriminatory and proportionate criteria for accessing
                    and maintaining viewability and brand safety partnerships —
                    with the Autorité saying the company integrated its current
                    partners "following an opaque procedure initiated by Meta
                    alone". And while it notes Meta informed it of new
                    eligibility criteria for the partnerships at the start of
                    this year it points out these are still not public, nor do
                    they appear to pass muster in other aspects, with the
                    regulator pointing out they are still intended to be
                    implemented as part of an (i.e. opaque) invitation system
                    and suggesting they seem "both disproportionate and
                    unjustified".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Secondly, the Autorité says Meta's refusal of partnership
                    access to Adloox is likely to be discriminatory, given its
                    assessment that the third party is in an equivalent
                    situation to others that have been granted access by Meta.

                    Working out how exactly to deorbit the station is a mammoth
                    undertaking. Many large objects have burned up in the
                    Earth's atmosphere, most notably <a

                    >. The ISS represents a whole new problem, however, being
                    more than three times the size of Mir. "It is a significant
                    challenge," says Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the
                    Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in the US. "A
                    400-tonne object falling out of the sky is not great."

                    Beginning as the single Russian-built Zarya module in 1998,
                    the station today is enormous, boasting 16 modules, vast
                    solar panels mounted on a metallic truss, and radiators to
                    expel heat. At 109m (356ft) in length it is the size of a
                    football field, the largest human structure ever assembled
                    in space. "It's like the pyramids of Giza," says Laura
                    Forczyk, a space analyst at the US consulting firm
                    Astralytical. A rotating crew of seven inhabit the station
                    today.

                    about 320km (200 miles) in mid-2030. At this point a final
                    crew will be sent to the station, likely ensuring any
                    remaining equipment or items of historical significance that
                    have yet to be removed are done so, also reducing the weight
                    of the station. "That is still in discussion," says
                    Aschbacher.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once the final crew has left, the station's altitude will
                    drop further to 280km (175 miles), deemed the point of no
                    return – where the station could no longer be boosted back
                    above the drag caused by our planet's thickening atmosphere
                    – a process that will take several months. Here, Russian
                    Progress spacecraft are earmarked to then give the station a
                    final push back into the planet's atmosphere.

                  <p>
                    [...] Whatever spacecraft is used, after this final push,
                    the station will reach an altitude of 120km (75 miles),
                    where it will hit the Earth's thicker atmosphere at some
                    29,000km/h (18,000 mph), beginning re-entry in earnest.
                    First, the solar panels will be torn from the structure.
                    "The headwind will be so much," says McDowell. Based on

                    A recent MIT paper proposes a new method to "grow" 2D
                    transistors on top of wafers, potentially speeding the
                    production of ultrathin computing materials. The study
                    claims to solve the heating and assembly problems of other
                    methods, possibly opening new avenues for semiconductors.

                    Manufacturers like Intel, Samsung, and TSMC continually find
                    ways to make ever-smaller transistors to guarantee ongoing
                    increases in processing power each year. TSMC and Samsung
                    have started 3nm semiconductor production as Intel looks
                    forward to counting transistor size in Angstroms, while talk
                    has also shifted to "2D materials" that are only a few atoms
                    thick.

                    [...] One problem with building the 2D material molybdenum
                    disulfide is heat. Growing some of its components requires
                    temperatures over 550 degrees Celsius, but silicon wafer
                    circuits start decaying beyond 400. Normally, manufacturers
                    graft the 2D material onto the wafer after its production,
                    often leading to imperfections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers instead grew the material directly onto the
                    wafer with a new kind of kiln that separates part of the
                    cooking process. A high-temperature zone processes the
                    sulfur, after which it flows into the lower-temperature
                    region where the molybdenum and the wafer are kept below
                    400C. The system leads to more uniform surfaces and faster
                    production.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the prior method could take an entire day to grow a
                    layer, the new technique can grow a layer in under an hour.
                    The improvement could enable growth across larger surfaces,
                    and the researchers plan to explore stacking layers.

                    interventions. Neuroimaging revealed an increase in grey
                    matter in four brain regions involved in high-level
                    cognitive functioning in all participants, including

                    However, the researchers also found a difference between the
                    two groups. In the pianists, the volume of grey matter
                    remained stable in the right primary auditory cortex - a key
                    region for sound processing, whereas it decreased in the
                    active listening group. ''In addition, a global brain
                    pattern of atrophy was present in all participants.
                    Therefore, we cannot conclude that musical interventions
                    rejuvenate the brain. They only prevent ageing in specific

                    it, or rather it wants to have continued access to the huge

                    chipmakers over the rules governing what investments
                    companies will be able to make in China. These need to be

                Multiple sites have been reporting that former Audi CEO, Rupert
                Stadler, will plead guilty for his role in the 2015 emissions
                scandal where Audi and VW software was modified to evade
                emissions testing. The proprietary software embedded in the cars
                was modified to detect when the cars were being operated in
                testing conditions and modified the vehicle's operation to
                reduce emissions enough to pass the inspection. However, during
                normal operation, they polluted like crazy, up to 40x the NOx
                shown during testing conditions. The plea deal he has been
                offered to him in this trial which started 2020 is expected to
                be a €1.1 million fine and serve a suspended sentence of up to
                two years. Stadler has spent several months in pre-trial
                detention to prevent him from interfering with witnesses
                further.

                The scandal has cost those automakers tens of billions so far.
                There was an initial attempt to blame only low level employees.
                However, as the trial shows there was more to it than that and
                that plans came from the highest levels. Further documents show
                that the emissions software had been in cheat mode for many
                years.

                    no longer needed given that more than 99% of all web pages

                    China is also developing its own megaconstellation, but
                    Europe clearly did not want to hand over its secure
                    communications to a global rival with questionable intent.
                    That left OneWeb. But this network is partially owned by the
                    United Kingdom—which very publicly exited the European Union
                    a few years ago—and may not have the capacity to meet all of
                    Europe's needs.

                    are serious questions about how all of these big partners
                    can work together and whether the bureaucracy of the
                    European government can get this project moving forward

                    helping organizations identify where current public-key
                    algorithms will need to be replaced, as the National

                    Current goals outlined in the working draft include helping
                    entities locate where and how public key algorithms are
                    utilized in encryption schemes, developing a strategy to
                    migrate these algorithms to quantum-resilient substitutes
                    and performing interoperability and performance testing.

                    [...] A major theme of the document is to help organizations
                    understand the security architecture in their networks so
                    that they firmly grasp where post-quantum security measures
                    will need to be implemented and where to prioritize
                    modernization. NIST also aims to compile a definitive
                    inventory of software vendors to support post-quantum

                are there some stories that you think an animated movie would

                Photonic circuits are a very promising technology for neural
                networks because they make it possible to build energy-efficient
                computing units. For years, the
                <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en">Politecnico di Milano</a> has
                been working on developing programmable photonic processors
                integrated on silicon microchips only a few mm2 in size for use

                    "An artificial neuron, like a biological neuron, must
                    perform very simple mathematical operations, such as
                    addition and multiplication, but in a neural network
                    consisting of many densely interconnected neurons, the
                    energy cost of these operations grows exponentially and
                    quickly becomes prohibitive. Our chip incorporates a
                    photonic accelerator that allows calculations to be carried
                    out very quickly and efficiently, using a programmable grid
                    of silicon interferometers. The calculation time is equal to
                    the transit time of light in a chip a few millimeters in
                    size, so we are talking about less than a billionth of a
                    second (0.1 nanoseconds)," says

                    "The advantages of photonic neural networks have long been
                    known, but one of the missing pieces to fully exploit their
                    potential was network training.. It is like having a
                    powerful calculator, but not knowing how to use it. In this
                    study, we succeeded in implementing training strategies for
                    photonic neurons similar to those used for conventional
                    neural networks. The photonic 'brain' learns quickly and
                    accurately and can achieve precision comparable to that of a
                    conventional neural network, but faster and with
                    considerable energy savings. These are all building blocks

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Her parents signed up for a clinical trial of an in-utero
                    surgical treatment to see if doctors could intervene before
                    any of these outcomes materialized. It seems to have worked.
                    The team behind the operation now plans to treat more
                    fetuses in the same way. Other, similar brain conditions
                    might benefit from the same approach. For conditions like
                    these, fetal brain surgery could be the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The baby's condition, known as vein of Galen malformation,
                    was first noticed during a routine ultrasound scan at 30
                    weeks of pregnancy. The condition occurs when a vein
                    connects with an artery in the brain. These two types of
                    vessels have different functions and should be kept
                    separate—arteries ferry high-pressure flows of oxygenated
                    blood from the heart, while thin-walled veins carry
                    low-pressure blood back the other way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the two combine, the high-pressure blood flow from an
                    artery can stretch the thin walls of the vein. "Over time
                    the vein essentially blows up like a balloon," says Darren
                    Orbach, a radiologist at Boston Children's Hospital in
                    Massachusetts, who treats babies born with the condition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The resulting balloon of blood can cause serious problems
                    for a baby. "It's stealing blood from the rest of the
                    circulation," says Mario Ganau, a consultant neurosurgeon at
                    Oxford University Hospitals in the UK, who was not involved
                    in this particular case. Other parts of the brain can end up
                    being starved of oxygenated blood, causing brain damage, and
                    there's a risk of bleeding in the brain. The extra pressure
                    put on the heart to pump blood can lead to heart failure.
                    And other organs can suffer too—especially the lungs and
                    kidneys, says Ganau.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fetuses with the condition are thought to be protected by
                    the placenta to some degree. But that changes from the
                    moment the umbilical cord is clamped at birth. "All of a
                    sudden there's this enormous burden placed right on the
                    newborn heart," says Orbach. "Most babies with this
                    condition will become very sick, very quickly."

                    Monopoly Market has been seized by authorities, while 288
                    suspects have been arrested. These individuals are believed
                    to have bought or sold drugs on the dark web through this

                    The international operation – called SpecTor – involved
                    "separate complementary actions" in Austria, France,
                    Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Brazil, the UK, the US and
                    Switzerland. The information used to conduct the operation
                    stemmed from "troves of evidence provided by German
                    authorities", according to Europol which coordinated the
                    international law enforcement action. These German
                    authorities successfully seized "criminal infrastructure" in
                    December 2021, which was used to create evidence for
                    hundreds of national investigations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "A number of investigations to identify additional
                    individuals behind dark web accounts are still ongoing,"
                    Europol wrote in a statement. "As law enforcement
                    authorities gained access to the vendors' extensive buyer
                    lists, thousands of customers across the globe are now at
                    risk of prosecution as well."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The US Department of Justice claims that Operation SpecTor
                    led to more seizures "than any prior operation". The total
                    seizures include 117 firearms, 850kg of different drugs and
                    $53.4m in both cash and virtual currencies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Commenting on the successful operation, Europol executive
                    director Catherine De Bolle said the law enforcement
                    coalition proves that "we all do better when we work
                    together".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This operation sends a strong message to criminals on the
                    dark web: international law enforcement has the means and
                    the ability to identify and hold you accountable for your
                    illegal activities, even on the dark web," De Bolle said.

                    [...] "According to the measured meteorological data by
                    Zhurong and other Mars rovers, we inferred that these dune
                    surface characteristics were related to the involvement of
                    liquid saline water formed by the subsequent melting of
                    frost/snow falling on the salt-containing dune surfaces when
                    cooling occurs," Qin Xiaoguang, a geophysicist at the
                    Chinese Academy of Sciences, said in an academy
                    <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/987713"

                    Mars' atmosphere is only 1% the density of Earth's, making
                    it difficult for liquid water to exist on Mars today. But
                    frozen water crops up regularly, in the form of possible
                    subsurface lakes and even relict glaciers on the planet's
                    surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Based on the age of the dunes, they may have been
                    hydrated when water vapor moved from the planet's polar ice
                    sheet to its equator, making the planet's lower latitudes
                    more humid. Like the discovery of the glacial remnants on
                    Mars, these findings boost humankind's hopes for water's
                    ability to persist near Mars' relatively balmy equator,

                    that the company was pleased with the case. He claimed the
                    verdict "left no doubt" that Samsung had wilfully infringed
                    Netlist patents, and is "currently using Netlist technology

                    While reverse-engineering the 8086 from die photos, a
                    particular circuit caught my eye because its physical layout
                    on the die didn't match the surrounding circuitry. This
                    circuit turns out to implement special functionality for a
                    couple of instructions, subtlely changing the way they
                    interacted with interrupts. Some web searching revealed that
                    this behavior was changed by Intel in 1978 to fix a problem
                    with early versions of the 8086 chip. By studying the die,
                    we can get an idea of how Intel dealt with bugs in the 8086
                    microprocessor.

                    In modern CPUs, bugs can often be fixed through a microcode
                    patch that updates the CPU during boot.1 However, prior to
                    the Pentium Pro (1995), microprocessors could only be fixed
                    through a change to the design that fixed the silicon.

                    TSMC is said to be in wide ranging talks about the
                    significant investment required to open a new chip fab in
                    Saxony, Germany. Private investment may be as high as €10
                    billion (~$11 billion), according to "people familiar with
                    the matter" talking to
                    <a
                      href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-03/tsmc-plans-for-first-german-chip-fab-with-cost-up-to-10-billion?leadSource=uverify%20wall#xj4y7vzkg"
                      >Bloomberg</a
                    >
                    reporters. Public funds might end up matching that amount,
                    to reel in this strategic investment, but the European
                    Commission will have to greenlight any state aid. It is
                    understood that TSMC's first fab in Europe will concentrate
                    on 28nm production.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the plans reported upon by Bloomberg are correct, TSMC
                    will work in partnership with NXP Semiconductors, Robert
                    Bosch, and Infineon Technologies to provide a wide base for
                    the venture. The partnership will spread the €10 billion
                    (~$11 billion) investment risk. TSMC partners' local
                    business knowledge will help in both planning and the
                    raising of state aid. Public funds won't quite meet the
                    private investment level, at least initially. Bloomberg's
                    report says that state subsidy levels will start at around
                    the €7 billion mark ($7.75 billion), but could well rise to
                    match the private investment capital.

                    was designed to catch the biggest fish in semiconductors,
                    TSMC and its partners' plans will be hard to resist.
                    According to Bloomberg, it is typical for similar projects
                    to gain 40% funding through EU subsidies, as the region
                    strides to double its
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/eu-wants-to-consolidate-local-chip-makers"
                      >global semiconductor production</a
                    >
                    share by 2030. Approval for these state subsidies will have
                    to come from the European Commission, and negotiations over
                    the size of subsidies will understandably be intense.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the negotiations run smoothly, Bloomberg says that the
                    Saxony chip fab project could be approved by TSMC by August.
                    It won't be a leading edge facility, says the source,
                    instead it will be tasked with churning out 28nm chips. A
                    report shared by AnandTech last summer says that TSMC is
                    "strongly encouraging its customers," still using its oldest
                    nodes
                    <a
                      href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17470/tsmc-to-customers-time-to-stop-using-older-nodes-move-to-28nm"
                      >to migrate</a

                    their mature designs to 28nm, which will become a new base
                    level semiconductor component fab choice. While PC
                    enthusiasts might turn their noses up at 28nm, the output
                    will be welcomed by manufacturers who fared badly during the
                    chip drought of the early 2020s.

                    The plan basically involves charging users an extra $2-$3 a
                    month if it's found that someone is using your account
                    outside of your home. The problem: Netflix has already been
                    imposing blanket price hikes, and it already limits the
                    number of simultaneously streams per account, forcing users
                    to subscribe to more expensive tiers if they want to expand
                    the limit.

                  <p>
                    While the crackdown isn't expected to hit U.S. subscribers
                    until the end of the second quarter (aka soon), the effort
                    has generally been a hot mess in the smaller countries
                    Netflix first used as guinea pigs to test both the
                    underlying tech and company messaging.

                    The company had to suspend the efforts in countries like

                        of the password sharing clampdown. In a worrying sign
                        for the next quarter, 10% of remaining Netflix

                    [...] Newly released SpaceX video of the ViaSat-3 mission
                    shows stage separation, second stage engine startup, and the
                    jettisoning of the fairings, which split apart as two halves
                    and fell back to Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A second video provides a POV perspective of one fairing's
                    free fall through the atmosphere. In a tweet, SpaceX said
                    fairing reentry for this mission "was the hottest and
                    fastest we've ever attempted." Reaching 15 times the speed
                    of sound, the reentering fairing produced a "large trail of
                    plasma in its wake," the company wrote.

                    >
                    after discovering that attackers had access to the personal
                    information of hundreds of customers for more than a month,
                    starting late February 2023.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Compared to previous data breaches reported by T-Mobile, the
                    latest of which impacted 37 million people, this incident
                    affected only 836 customers. Still, the amount of exposed
                    information is highly extensive and exposes affected
                    individuals to identity theft and phishing attacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In March 2023, the measures we have in place to alert us to
                    unauthorized activity worked as designed and we were able to
                    determine that a bad actor gained access to limited
                    information from a small number of T-Mobile accounts between
                    late February and March 2023," the company said in data
                    breach notification letters sent to affected individuals
                    just before the weekend, on Friday, April 28, 2023.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    T-Mobile said the threat actors didn't gain access to call
                    records or affected individuals' personal financial account
                    info, but the exposed personally identifiable information
                    contains more than enough data for identity theft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the exposed information varied for each of the
                    affected customers, it could include "full name, contact
                    information, account number and associated phone numbers,
                    T-Mobile account PIN, social security number, government ID,
                    date of birth, balance due, internal codes that T-Mobile
                    uses to service customer accounts (for example, rate plan
                    and feature codes), and the number of lines."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After detecting the security breach, T-Mobile proactively
                    reset account PINs for impacted customers and now offers
                    them two years of free credit monitoring and identity theft
                    detection services through Transunion myTrueIdentity.

                    I have no mouth and I must scream—the AI workforce appears
                    to be full steam ahead. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said that the
                    company is planning to pause or slow hiring in the coming
                    years for roles in which AI could replace humans.

                    email. "IBM is being deliberate and thoughtful in our hiring
                    with a focus on revenue-generating roles, and we're being
                    very selective when filling jobs that don't directly touch
                    our clients or technology. We are actively hiring for
                    thousands of positions right now."

                    [...] What companies like IBM are willfully ignoring is that
                    AI could serve a supplement to labor by making menial tasks
                    easier or even non-existent, thereby optimizing the

                    Microsoft knew cloud gaming would be a key concern, and
                    that's why it has spent the past couple of months preparing
                    by signing deals with Boosteroid, Ubitus, and Nvidia to
                    allow Xbox PC games to run on rival cloud gaming services.
                    These 10-year deals will also include access to
                    <em>Call of Duty</em> and other Activision Blizzard games if
                    Microsoft's deal is approved by regulators. If it's not
                    approved, then the deals are off for Activision games, with
                    only access to Microsoft's Xbox PC games being supplied.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Most of this deal now rests on the European Union's
                    shoulders. The cloud deals Microsoft has been signing are
                    also designed to appease regulators in the EU.
                    <em>Reuters</em> reported last month that the Activision
                    deal is likely to be approved by EU regulators following the
                    Nvidia and Nintendo licensing agreements. The EU is due to
                    make a decision by May 22nd, and Microsoft is once again
                    trying to get out ahead of regulators by signing a fresh
                    deal with European cloud gaming platform Nware. Nvidia and
                    Boosteroid, which both signed Microsoft's 10-year cloud
                    deal, have
                    <a

                    >
                    the CMA's decision, with Microsoft hoping this kind of
                    backing will sway EU regulators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An EU approval could offer a glimmer of hope for Microsoft's
                    giant deal, as such a move would put pressure on the UK as
                    the only major market to outright block the acquisition.
                    Regulators in Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Chile, Serbia, Japan,
                    and South Africa have already approved the deal. Microsoft
                    does face trouble closer to home, though.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the US, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block
                    Microsoft and Activision Blizzard's deal late last year. The
                    FTC case is still at the document discovery stage, with an
                    evidentiary hearing scheduled for August 2nd. Microsoft and
                    Sony lawyers are already arguing over which (and how many)
                    documents should be presented as part of the legal discovery
                    process, and we're months away from knowing how the case
                    will proceed.

                    It may not work so well yet, but the experiment raises
                    ethical issues around the possible future use of brain
                    decoders for surveillance and interrogation. With this in
                    mind, the team set out to test whether you could train and
                    run a decoder without a person's cooperation. They did this
                    by trying to decode perceived speech from each participant
                    using decoder models trained on data from another person.
                    They found that they performed "barely above chance."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This, they say, suggests that a decoder couldn't be applied
                    to someone's brain activity unless that person was willing
                    and had helped train the decoder in the first place.

                    "We think that mental privacy is really important, and that
                    nobody's brain should be decoded without their cooperation,"
                    says Jerry Tang, a PhD student at the university who worked
                    on the project. "We believe it's important to keep
                    researching the privacy implications of brain decoding, and
                    enact policies that protect each person's mental privacy."

                    the web, and trying to interest commercial software
                    companies in the tech.

                    He next tried to convince the European Union to promote the

                    away thinking that the organization would take too long to
                    make that happen.

                    The decision to release code to the public domain was
                    therefore easy.

                    [...] CERN later decided an open source licence was a better
                    idea for the web than a complete free-for-all. But that
                    doesn't diminish the significance of the anniversary.

                    MindGeek, the owner of adult platforms such as Pornhub, has

                    Utah has been fighting against online pornography for years.
                    It called porn a public health crisis in 2016 and previously
                    proposed that all smartphones and tablets in the state

                    pornography. An age verification law was eventually passed
                    in March, requiring users visiting adult platforms deemed
                    "harmful to minors" to verify their age before being allowed
                    access.

                    >
                    writes that any companies that don't comply with the law
                    will be liable if they're sued over minors accessing their
                    content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now that the law has gone into effect, MindGeek has
                    responded by blocking anyone in Utah who tries to access
                    Pornhub. Those with Utah IPs will see only a video of adult
                    performer Cherie DeVille, a member of the Adult Performer
                    Advocacy Committee, explaining the reason for the block.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "As you may know, your elected officials in Utah are
                    requiring us to verify your age before allowing you access
                    to our website," DeVille says. "While safety and compliance
                    are at the forefront of our mission, giving your ID card
                    every time you want to visit an adult platform is not the
                    most effective solution for protecting our users, and in
                    fact, will put children and your privacy at risk."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    DeVille adds that "mandating age verification without proper
                    enforcement" drives users to other sites with fewer safety
                    measures in place.

                    Geoffrey Hinton, 75, announced his resignation from Google
                    in a statement to the New York Times, saying he now
                    regretted his work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He told the BBC some of the dangers of AI chatbots were
                    "quite scary". "Right now, they're not more intelligent than
                    us, as far as I can tell. But I think they soon may be."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr Hinton also accepted that his age had played into his
                    decision to leave the tech giant, telling the BBC: "I'm 75,
                    so it's time to retire." Dr Hinton's pioneering research on
                    neural networks and deep learning has paved the way for
                    current AI systems like ChatGPT.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In artificial intelligence, neural networks are systems that
                    are similar to the human brain in the way they learn and
                    process information. They enable AIs to learn from
                    experience, as a person would. This is called deep learning.
                    The British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer
                    scientist told the BBC that chatbots could soon overtake the
                    level of information that a human brain holds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Right now, what we're seeing is things like GPT-4 eclipses
                    a person in the amount of general knowledge it has and it
                    eclipses them by a long way. In terms of reasoning, it's not
                    as good, but it does already do simple reasoning," he said.
                    "And given the rate of progress, we expect things to get
                    better quite fast. So we need to worry about that."

                    many copies of the same set of weights, the same model of
                    the world. "And all these copies can learn separately but
                    share their knowledge instantly. So it's as if you had
                    10,000 people and whenever one person learnt something,
                    everybody automatically knew it. And that's how these

                    nothing more than make some noise and embarrass yourself.

                    This policy isn't in place because Mullvad wants to protect

                According to one of the relevant laws, the government can only
                grant the police permission to search the premises if it can be
                tangibly demonstrated that there is a reasonable expectation of
                finding items subject to seizure. Given that Mullvad neither
                collects that information nor is required to collect that
                information, there was no basis for the raid except, I
                conjecture, for possible harassment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore the Swedish authorities seem to have lost Mullvad's
                earlier inquiry.

                    [...] With Python 3.12, Snow and his cohort cleaned up
                    Python's internals enough to make subinterpreters useful,
                    and they are adding a minimal module to the Python standard
                    library called interpreters. This gives programmers a
                    rudimentary way to launch subinterpreters and execute code
                    on them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Another major set of performance improvements Shannon
                    mentioned, Python's new adaptive specializing interpreter,
                    was discussed in detail in a separate session by core Python
                    developer Brandt Bucher.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Python 3.11 introduced new bytecodes to the interpreter,
                    called <em>adaptive instructions</em>. These instructions
                    can be replaced automatically at runtime with versions
                    specialized for a given Python type, a process called
                    <em>quickening</em>. This saves the interpreter the step of
                    having to look up what types the objects are, speeding up
                    the whole process enormously. For instance, if a given
                    addition operation regularly takes in two integers, that
                    instruction can be replaced with one that assumes the
                    operands are both integers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Python objects have historically used a lot of memory.
                    A Python 3 object header, even without the data for the
                    object, occupied 208 bytes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the last several versions of Python, though, various
                    efforts took place to streamline the way Python objects were
                    designed, finding ways to share memory or represent things
                    more compactly. Shannon outlined how as of Python 3.12, the
                    object header's now a mere 96 bytes—slightly less than half
                    of what it was before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These changes don't just allow more Python objects to be
                    kept in memory, they also improve cache locality for Python
                    objects. While that by itself may not speed things up as
                    significantly as other efforts, it's still a boon.

                  <p>
                    [...] The default Python implementation, CPython, has three
                    decades of development behind it. That also means three
                    decades of cruft, legacy APIs, and design decisions that can
                    be hard to transcend—all of which make it hard to improve
                    Python in key ways.

                    [...] One key issue is the proliferation of C APIs found in
                    CPython, the reference runtime for the language. As of
                    Python 3.8,

                      >there are a few different sets of APIs</a
                    >, each with different maintenance requirements. Over the
                    last five years, Stinner worked to make many public APIs
                    private, so programmers don't need to deal as directly with
                    sensitive CPython internals. The long-term goal is to make
                    components that use the C APIs, like Python extension
                    modules, less dependent on things that might change with
                    each version.

                    to move carefully and methodically so that they don't stifle
                    innovation and so that they create long-lasting rules that

                    In a Twitter audio chat on Saturday, SpaceX's founder, Elon

                    rocket and Super Heavy booster launch in April. One of the
                    biggest revelations: The self-destruct setting took 40
                    seconds to work — a seemingly short time, except when you're
                    uncertain if the massive rocket you just launched will blow
                    up before hitting land. To recap the day's events, the
                    rocket and booster cleared the launch pad before being
                    unable to separate from each other, flipping and, finally,
                    blowing up. The automated command should have immediately
                    caused an explosion, but tumbled around for a bit first.

                    In one of many spins on the day's failures, Musk claimed it
                    was because "the vehicle's structural margins appear to be
                    better than we expected." While SpaceX previously said the

                    The delayed self-destruction wasn't the only issue following
                    the launch from SpaceX's facility in Boca Chica, Texas.
                    After the eventual explosion,

                    The latter resulted in a 3.5-acre fire. Musk's response? "To
                    the best of our knowledge there has not been any meaningful
                    damage to the environment that we're aware of."

                  <p>
                    The FAA has already announced it's investigating the events
                    and will ground Starship until "determining that any system,
                    process or procedure related to the mishap does not affect
                    public safety." Even with all of that, Musk went so far as
                    to call the launch "successful" and "maybe slightly
                    exceeding my expectations."

                    Bhutan's Ministry of Finance did not respond to a list of
                    questions from <em>Forbes</em> about the scope of the
                    enterprise. It's unclear when mining began, where it's
                    located and whether the scheme has turned a profit. (As for
                    the start date, bitcoin was valued at $5,000 in April 2019.)
                    It's also unclear why Bhutan never disclosed the project to
                    its citizens or international partners.

                    [...] Bhutan's government appears to have considered working
                    with other miners beyond Bitdeer. Insiders at rival services
                    and pools, where miners share compute power to unlock new
                    bitcoin blocks faster, said they have held advanced talks
                    with senior government officials, including Druk, about the
                    kingdom building and operating a hydro-powered operation.
                    Consultants who advised the government on its mining
                    strategy prior to Bitdeer's announcement told
                    <em>Forbes</em> that Bhutan had previously inquired about a
                    100 MW operation hooked into one of its hydroelectric
                    plants.

                    Researchers at Linköping University and the KTH Royal
                    Institute of Technology have developed the world's first
                    transistor made of wood. Their study, published in the
                    journal PNAS, paves the way for further development of
                    wood-based electronics and control of electronic plants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We've come up with an unprecedented principle. Yes, the wood
                    transistor is slow and bulky, but it does work, and has huge
                    development potential," says Isak Engquist, senior associate
                    professor at the Laboratory for Organic Electronics
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In previous trials, transistors made of wood have been able
                    to regulate ion transport only. And when the ions run out,
                    the transistor stops functioning. The transistor developed
                    by the Linköping researchers, however, can function
                    continuously and regulate electricity flow without
                    deteriorating.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers used balsa wood to create their transistor,
                    as the technology involved requires a grainless wood that is
                    evenly structured throughout. They removed the lignin,
                    leaving only long cellulose fibres with channels where the
                    lignin had been.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These channels were then filled with a conductive plastic,
                    or polymer, called PEDOT:PSS, resulting in an electrically
                    conductive wood material.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers used this to build the wood transistor and
                    could show that it is able to regulate electric current and
                    provide continuous function at a selected output level. It
                    could also switch the power on and off, albeit with a
                    certain delay – switching it off took about a second; on,
                    about five seconds.

                Hospital and university clinics have historically helped people
                post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and phobias using virtual
                reality to immerse them in simulations that help them reckon
                with the problem. It was the foundation of a US Army program
                called BraveMind (
                <a href="https://medvr.ict.usc.edu/projects/bravemind.html"

                ). It is a virtual version of the longstanding technique called
                exposure therapy, in which people confront memories or fears,
                such as fear of flying or confined spaces - done actively with a
                therapist. However, a limited number of virtual-reality
                scenarios are available, and many patients must go to a
                specialized clinic for such care. Last week in the Wall Street
                Journal, they covered that researchers are aiming to make
                immersive VR-based therapy more personal and bring it into
                people's homes.

                    warning on looming regulatory risk it's facing in Europe —
                    where a decision is expected in a matter of weeks (by May
                    12) that could see the tech giant ordered to suspend its

                    >. So regular TechCrunch readers will already know that a
                    key development Meta is hoping will save its bacon in Europe
                    is the adoption of a new high level data transfer pact which
                    aims to resolve the legal uncertainty around EU data
                    exports.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In its earnings report, Meta tells investors it's
                    hopeful the new EU-US data framework will arrive soon enough
                    to be implemented before the deadline for a suspension of
                    its EU transfers — meaning, were these stars to align, it
                    could reboot its claim to have an authorized mechanism for
                    its EU transfers and flick the suspension order away —
                    however the company also warns it "cannot exclude the
                    possibility" that adoption won't happen soon enough to
                    prevent such an order.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] During a call with investors, the social networking
                    giant was asked about the potential impact on revenues if it
                    is forced to suspend EU-US data flows on regulatory order.
                    Responding, CFO Susan Li began by reiterating its hope that
                    the new high level framework will save its bacon. However,
                    if this sought for escape hatch fails to open in time, she
                    warned investors Meta is facing a hit of around a tenth of
                    its worldwide ad revenue — saying "roughly 10%" of this
                    comes from ads delivered to Facebook users in EU countries.

                    Soil on the Moon contains compounds that could potentially
                    be used to produce oxygen with the help of radiation from
                    the Sun. In order to test that out, a team of scientists
                    from NASA's Carbothermal Reduction Demonstration (CaRD)
                    created fine-grained soil to simulate the material covering
                    the Moon's surface.

                    Using a high-powered laser that simulated heat from a solar
                    energy concentrator (which is similar to a magnifying lens),
                    the team then melted the lunar soil simulant, NASA
                    explained. After the soil was heated, the scientists
                    detected carbon monoxide using the Mass Spectrometer
                    Observing Lunar Operations (MSolo), a device that was
                    designed to help scientists look for water on the Moon.

                    [...] The process of heating the soil and extracting the
                    oxygen took place inside a carbothermal reactor, a device
                    that uses high temperatures to produce carbon monoxide or
                    dioxide on Earth to create items like solar panels and
                    steel, according to NASA. The test was the first time the
                    reactor was used inside the Moon-like chamber, providing
                    possible proof that it can in fact operate in the lunar
                    environment.

                    from the Qualcomm firmware known as AMSS. "This covert

                    [...] "While our business is profitable, our growth has been
                    slowing," Houston said. "Part of this is due to the natural
                    maturation of our existing businesses, but more recently,
                    headwinds from the economic downturn have put pressure on
                    our customers and, in turn, on our business. As a result,
                    some investments that used to deliver positive returns are
                    no longer sustainable."

                    [...] They concluded that the onggi's porous walls permitted
                    the carbon dioxide to escape the container, which
                    accelerated the speed of fermentation. The onggi's porosity
                    also functioned as a "safety valve," resulting in a slower
                    increase in carbon dioxide levels than the glass jar while
                    blocking the entry of external particles. Their data
                    revealed that the carbon dioxide level in onggi was less
                    than half of that in glass containers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They also found that the beneficial bacteria in the
                    onggi-made kimchi proliferated 26% more than in the glass
                    counterpart. In the glass jar, the lactic acid bacteria
                    became suffocated by their own carbon dioxide in the closed
                    glass container. It turns out that, because the onggi
                    releases carbon dioxide in small rates, the lactic acid
                    bacteria are happier and reproduce more.

                  <p>
                    [...] "It's amazing that, for thousands of years, people
                    have been building these special containers out of dirt, but
                    in many ways, they are very high tech," Hu said. "We
                    discovered that the right amount of porosity enables kimchi
                    to ferment faster, and these onggi provide that."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kim said that some artisans still use ancient methods when
                    making onggi, but their numbers are decreasing. Now, the
                    market is flooded with inauthentic versions of the vessels.

                    "We hope this study draws attention to this traditional
                    artisan work and inspires energy-efficient methods for
                    fermenting and storing foods," he said. "Also, the onggi are
                    quite beautiful."

                    Zhurong launched in July 2020 aboard China's first
                    interplanetary mission, Tianwen-1. It was designed to study
                    Martian geology, mapping and analyzing the terrain while
                    looking for materials useful to support future manned
                    missions. It did that, with aplomb, for an entire year after
                    it landed in May 2021.

                    NASA's Insight mission which was

                    The rate at which Mars landers succumb to dust is testament
                    to the success of the two rovers currently residing on Mars:
                    NASA's Perseverance and Curiosity. Perseverance has been in
                    operation for almost two years, and Curiosity has trundled
                    around for over a decade. In fact, one of Curiosity's
                    limitations has turned out to be not its power source, but
                    the wear and tear on its

                    Curiosity uses a radioisotope power system to generate
                    electricity from the heat of plutonium's radioactive decay.
                    It has two lithium ion rechargeable batteries for when power
                    demand temporarily exceeds the generator's output.
