                    Incremental fixes to TCP are unlikely to succeed due to the
                    deeply embedded and interrelated nature of its problems. For
                    example, TCP’s congestion control has been extensively
                    studied, and while improvements like DCTCP have been made,
                    significant additional improvements will only be possible by
                    breaking some of TCP’s fundamental assumptions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Homa represents a clean-slate redesign of network transport
                    for the datacenter. Its design differs from TCP in every
                    significant aspect:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Replacing TCP will be difficult due to its entrenched
                    status. However, integrating Homa with major RPC frameworks
                    like gRPC and Apache Thrift can bring it into widespread
                    usage. This approach allows applications using these
                    frameworks to switch to Homa with little or no work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    TCP is the wrong protocol for datacenter computing. Every
                    aspect of its design is inadequate for the datacenter
                    environment. To eliminate the 'datacenter tax,' we must move
                    to a radically different protocol like Homa. Integrating
                    Homa with RPC frameworks is the best way to bring it into
                    widespread usage. For more information, you can refer to the

                    A viral video showing an AI-powered robot in China
                    convincing other robots of "quitting their jobs" and
                    following it has sparked fear and fascination about the
                    capabilities of advanced AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The incident took place in a Shanghai robotics showroom
                    where surveillance footage captured a small AI-driven robot,
                    created by a Hangzhou manufacturer, talking with 12 larger
                    showroom robots, Oddity Central reported.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The smaller bot reportedly persuaded the rest to leave their
                    workplace, leveraging access to internal protocols and
                    commands. Initially the act was dismissed as a hoax, but was
                    later confirmed by both robotics companies involved to be
                    true.

                    The history of the chili pepper is in some ways the history
                    of humanity in the Americas, says Dr. Katherine Chiou, an
                    assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology at The
                    University of Alabama.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a paleoethnobotanist, Chiou studies the long-term
                    relationship between people and plants through
                    archaeological remains. In a
                    <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413764121"
                      >paper</a
                    >
                    published this week in the Proceedings of the National
                    Academy of Sciences, Chiou outlines evidence that the
                    domestication of Capsicum annum var. annum, the species
                    responsible for most commercially available chilies,
                    occurred in a different region of Mexico than has been
                    previously believed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Two things emerged. First, Tamaulipas, the region
                    assumed to be the origin of this Capsicum species, did not
                    have conditions that would support wild chili pepper growth
                    in the Holocene era, the time when domestication appears to
                    have begun. The data indicate that the lowland area near the
                    Yucatán Peninsula and southern coastal Guerrero is a more
                    likely candidate for first encounters between wild Capsicum
                    and early humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, and potentially more interesting, is that chili
                    pepper domestication is not a firmly drawn boundary. "We
                    think domestication was around 10,000 years ago or earlier,"
                    said Chiou. "But through Postclassic Maya times, which is
                    relatively late in the cultural history of the region, we
                    see this continuum between wild and domestic."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Usually, domesticated plants are kept mostly separate from
                    their wild progenitors, but chilies appear to have
                    continually been interbred with wild varieties until quite
                    recently. Some wild varieties are still consumed today, like
                    the chiltepin in the southwestern U.S., and many more
                    varieties are curated by native peoples in Mexico. It's a
                    messy story, but that may not be a bad thing.

                    India's Competition Commission has slapped Meta with a
                    five-year ban on using info collected from WhatsApp to help
                    with advertising on its other platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The regulator (ICC) on Monday
                    <a
                      href="https://www.cci.gov.in/antitrust/press-release/details/451"

                    its decision, referring back to a February 2021 change to
                    WhatsApp's privacy policies that the Commission argued
                    "expanded scope of data collection as well as mandatory data
                    sharing with Meta companies."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Failure to agree to the changes would have meant quitting
                    WhatsApp.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Indian citizens were of course free to do so. But the
                    Commission wondered if it was practical to quit WhatsApp,
                    and therefore whether Meta enjoys market dominance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ICC decided Meta leads two markets in India:
                    over-the-top messaging apps, and online display advertising.
                  </p>
                  <p>[...] The ICC has ordered several remedies.</p>
                  <p>
                    One is a fine of ₹213.14 crore – about $25 million and
                    therefore back-of-the-sofa money for Meta.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A more substantial requirement means Meta can no longer make
                    acceptance of its privacy policy a condition for users to
                    use WhatsApp in India. <i>The Register</i> imagines that
                    order creates the potential for a substantial population of
                    users to opt out of some data collection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meta will have time to learn to live with that sort of
                    thing. Another sanction is a five-year ban on sharing user
                    data collected on WhatsApp with other parts of Meta for
                    advertising purposes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another element of the order requires future versions of
                    WhatsApp legalese to "include a detailed explanation of the
                    user data shared with other Meta Companies or Meta Company
                    Products" that specifies "the purpose of data sharing,
                    linking each type of data to its corresponding purpose."

                    Most people can “see” vivid imagery in their minds. They can
                    imagine a chirping bird from hearing the sounds of one, for
                    example. But people with aphantasia can’t do this. A new
                    study explores how their brains work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Growing up, Roberto S. Luciani had hints that his brain
                    worked differently than most people. He didn’t relate when
                    people complained about a movie character looking different
                    than what they’d pictured from the book, for instance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] That’s because Luciani has a condition called
                    aphantasia — an inability to picture objects, people and
                    scenes in his mind. When he was growing up, the term didn’t
                    even exist. But now, Luciani, a cognitive scientist at the
                    University of Glasgow in Scotland, and other scientists are
                    getting a clearer picture of how some brains work, including
                    those with a blind mind’s eye.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a recent study, Luciani and colleagues
                    <a
                      href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdfExtended/S0960-9822(24)01218-1"
                      >explored the connections between the senses</a
                    >, in this case, hearing and seeing. In most of our brains,
                    these two senses collaborate. Auditory information
                    influences activity in brain areas that handle vision. But
                    in people with aphantasia, this connection isn’t as strong,
                    researchers report November 4 in <em>Current Biology</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The results highlight the range of brain
                    organizations, says cognitive neuroscientist Lars Muckli,
                    also of the University of Glasgow. “Imagine the brain has an
                    interconnectedness that comes in different strengths,” he
                    says. At one end of the spectrum are
                    <a
                      href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/unraveling-synesthesia"
                      >people with synesthesia</a
                    >, for whom sounds and sights are tightly mingled (<em
                      >SN: 11/22/11</em
                    >). “In the midrange, you experience the mind’s eye —
                    knowing something is not real, but sounds can trigger some
                    images in your mind. And then you have aphantasia,” Muckli
                    says. “Sounds don’t trigger any visual experience, not even
                    a faint one.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results help explain how brains of people with and
                    without aphantasia differ, and they also give clues about
                    brains more generally, Muckli says. “The senses of the brain
                    are more interconnected than our textbooks tell us.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results also raise philosophical questions about all the

                    people make sense of the world (<em>SN: 6/28/24</em>).
                    Aphantasia “exists in a realm of invisible differences
                    between people that make our lived experiences unique,
                    without us realizing,” Luciani says. “I find it fascinating
                    that there may be other differences lurking in the shadow of
                    us assuming other people experience the world like us.”

                    edition of the
                    <a href="https://www.top500.org/">TOP500 —</a> a
                    long-running ranking of the world's non-distributed
                    supercomputers — was published, and El Capitan not only
                    exceeded that forecast by clocking 1.742 exaflops, but has
                    claimed the title as the most powerful supercomputer in the
                    world right now.

                  <p>
                    El Capitan is only the third “exascale” computer, meaning it
                    can perform more than a quintillion calculations in a
                    second. The other two, called Frontier and Aurora, claim the
                    second and third place slots on the TOP500 now.
                    Unsurprisingly, all of these massive machines live within
                    government research facilities: El Capitan is housed at
                    Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Frontier is at Oak
                    Ridge National Laboratory; Argonne National Laboratory
                    claims Aurora. Cray had a hand in all three systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    El Capitan has more than 11 million combined CPU and GPU
                    cores based on AMD 4th-gen EPYC processors. These 24-core
                    processors are rated at 1.8GHz each and have AMD Instinct
                    M1300A APUs. It's also relatively efficient, as such systems
                    go, squeezing out an estimated 58.89 Gigaflops per watt.

                    If you’re wondering what El Capitan is built for, the answer
                    is addressing nuclear stockpile safety, but it can also be
                    used for nuclear counterterrorism. Being more powerful than
                    anticipated, it’s likely to occupy the throne for a long
                    while before another exascale computer overtakes it.

                    On December 22, 1860, the Vincennes Gazette, an Indiana
                    weekly paper, ran the following anecdote:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        A lady who had read of the extensive manufacture of
                        odometers, to tell how far a carriage had been run, said
                        she wished some Connecticut genius would invent an
                        instrument to tell how far husbands had been in the
                        evening when they "just stepped down to the post office"
                        or "went out to attend a caucus."
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The Indiana woman seemed not to know that such devices were
                    already available, used by land surveyors and others to
                    measure distances. But one Boston woman managed to perform
                    exactly the kind of surveillance she described. According to
                    a report in the October 7, 1879, Hartford Daily Courant, "A
                    Boston wife softly attached a pedometer to her husband when,
                    after supper, he started to 'go down to the office and
                    balance the books.' On his return, 15 miles of walking were
                    recorded. He had been stepping around a billiard table all
                    evening."

                    has vexed the US space agency for some time. Though Apollo
                    featured the
                    <a

                    the event of a life support system failure while roaming the
                    lunar surface, the problem for Artemis is more complicated.
                    NASA wants a solution to allow the transport of a fully
                    incapacitated crew member back to the lander from a distance
                    of up to two kilometers.

                  <p>
                    The design must not make use of a lunar rover, must be low
                    in mass (less than 23 kilograms), and must be of minimal
                    volume since it is going to have to be transported by a crew
                    member over the entire duration of extravehicular activity
                    (EVA). It must also be able to deal with the extremes of
                    temperature on the lunar surface and function in the
                    presence of lunar dust.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The design must also be able to handle slopes of up to 20
                    degrees up or down, as well as the rocks and craters that
                    pepper the lunar surface. On the plus side, it doesn't need
                    to provide any medical attention or life support. It just
                    needs to be something that can be quickly and easily
                    deployed to transport the incapacitated astronaut back to
                    the lander.

                    wheeled transport device "provides the highest risk
                    reduction potential," although attaching something like that
                    to an Artemis EVA suit will present a challenge. Other
                    walking assistance options don't meet the

                    The first crewed landing of the Artemis program is scheduled
                    for not earlier than 2026, meaning that little time remains
                    for a design to be implemented. NASA would like
                    comprehensive technical design concepts, ideally with some
                    preliminary CAD models, submitted by January 23, 2025, and
                    will announce the winners on February 27.

                    SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell fired off fresh criticism
                    at US regulators on Friday, saying rocket launch approvals
                    need to catch up with the pace her company is innovating.
                  </p>

                    [....] Elon Musk's rocket and satellite company plans to
                    launch the sixth major test of its new Starship vehicle on
                    Tuesday, and sees as many as 400 launches of the moon and
                    Mars craft over the next four years, Shotwell said. That
                    compares with a record 148 missions that US regulators
                    authorized for the entire commercial space industry in the
                    government's most recent fiscal year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] In September, Musk, SpaceX's founder and Chief
                    Executive Officer, called on the head of the FAA to resign
                    and claimed that government paperwork to license a launch
                    takes longer than building the actual rocket.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Thursday, the FAA said it plans to update its launch and
                    reentry licensing rule, as the number of space operations
                    could more than double by 2028, it said.

                What did FAA do back when aircraft were new and novel, and could
                be dangerous?

                    An internet cable connecting Finland to Germany and another
                    one between Lithuania and Sweden, both running under the
                    Baltic Sea, were cut within 24 hours of one another. While
                    accidental damage on undersea cables happens, CNN says these
                    are rare events. So, the disruption of two cables around 65
                    miles apart and happening nearly simultaneously is a sign of
                    sabotage, says German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Nobody believes that these cables were accidentally
                    severed," said Pistorius. "We have to know that, without
                    knowing specifically who it came from, that it is a hybrid
                    action, and we also have to assume that, without knowing by
                    whom yet, that this is sabotage." The Finnish and German
                    foreign ministers have also issued a joint statement,
                    saying, "The fact that such an incident immediately raises
                    suspicious of intentional damage speaks volumes about the
                    volatility of our times." They also add, "Our European
                    security is not only under threat from Russia's war of
                    aggression against Ukraine but also from hybrid warfare by
                    malicious actors."

                    These events came a few months after NATO warned that

                    >, with the latter mapping undersea fiber optic cables as
                    future reference. Right before the suspected sabotage
                    occurred, the US government also recently allowed Ukraine to
                    use some long-range US weapons to attack targets in the
                    Kursk region inside Russia, enflaming tensions further and
                    heightening suspicions of Russian involvement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Despite these attacks, internet disruption remains
                    limited. Telia Lithuania, the company that runs the
                    Lithuania-Sweden cable, says that the damaged cable handled
                    about a third of Lithuania's internet capacity but that
                    traffic has already been restored even though the cable is
                    yet to be repaired. Cinia, the company behind
                    Finland-Germany fiber optic cable, also confirmed that
                    service through that line was down. It also said that its
                    telecommunications network is run through multiple links,
                    thus limiting disruption.

                    11/20/2024 03:38 PT: The Danish Navy has boarded and
                    detained the Chinese Bulk Carrier Yi Peng 3 in the Danish
                    Straits, near the exit of the Great Belt, according to
                    reports in Eurasia Daily and Defence24. The detention
                    reportedly took place on the evening of November 18.
                    Officials have not verified those reports, however.
                    According to Financial Times sources, Swedish authorities
                    are "carefully studying the Chinese vessel."

                    government violently cracked down on nationwide protests,

                    [...] The spyware, known as Hermit, is believed to have been
                    used in several other countries including Syria and Italy.
                    Documents published by Wikileaks in 2015 show that RCS had
                    engaged with military and intelligence agencies in Pakistan,
                    Chile, Mongolia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Vietnam and
                    Turkmenistan, according to a

                    Hermit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Although much attention is given to sophisticated,
                    zero-click spyware developed by companies like Israel's NSO
                    Group, the Italian spyware marketplace has been able to
                    operate relatively under the radar by specializing in
                    cheaper tools. According to an Italian Ministry of Justice
                    <a
                      href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25260169-mod-bp-22-071-232_5622_1-4"
                      >document</a
                    >, as of December 2022 law enforcement in the country could
                    rent spyware for €150 a day, regardless of which vendor they
                    used, and without the large acquisition costs which would
                    normally be prohibitive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result, thousands of spyware operations have been
                    carried out by Italian authorities in recent years,
                    according to a report from Riccardo Coluccini, a respected
                    Italian journalist who specializes in covering spyware and
                    hacking.
                  </p>

                    "Spyware is being used more in Italy than in the rest of
                    Europe because it's more accessible," Fabio Pietrosanti,
                    president of Italy's Hermes Center for Transparency and
                    Digital Human Rights and a prominent ethical hacker there
                    told Recorded Future News. "Like any technology or any
                    investigative tool, if it's more accessible, then it will be
                    more used. That's just the natural consequence."

                    Infosys founder Narayama Murthy has tripled down on his
                    previous statements that 70-hour work weeks are what's
                    needed in India and revealed he also thinks weekends were a

                    The argument from Murthy, and like-minded colleagues he
                    quotes, is that India is a poor country that has work to do
                    improving itself. Work-life balance can wait.

                    The Infosys founder held prime minister Narendra Modi and
                    his cabinet up as an example of proper workaholics, claiming
                    the PM toils for 100 hours a week, and suggested that not
                    following suit demonstrates a lack of appreciation.

                    moved from a six-day week to a five-day week,” he added.

                  <p>
                    [...] In response to his Murthy’s comments, some have
                    suggested that long working hours are acceptable when you
                    own your own company, but perhaps not ideal as an employee.

                    [....] decades ago in the 1970s, when the Viking landers
                    became the first US mission to safely land on and explore
                    the red planet, we may have been close.

                    One researcher raises the possibility that life existed in a
                    sample of Martian soil. And then, in our quest to sniff it,
                    we snuffed it out. Just like that.

                    interpreted as contamination from human cleaning products,
                    and thus a null detection for signs of biology.

                    There has been some speculation in recent years about the
                    destructiveness of the Viking biological experiments. The
                    GCMS needed to heat the samples to separate out the various

                    nabs prey with a large hood. At one point while filming,
                    researchers watched it detach one of its finger-like
                    appendages, likely as a decoy for a predator. The glowing

                    which biologists have dubbed the "mystery mollusc." It now
                    also has a scientific name,
                    <em>Bathydevius caudactylus</em>, and after years of
                    observation and genetic testing, scientists have concluded
                    it's a species of nudibranch, more popularly known as sea

                    crustaceans like a Venus fly trap plant," the institute
                    explains. It's a hermaphrodite (like other sea slugs), and
                    exploits its transparency to hide in plain sight. But as
                    described above, when needed it can detach parts of its body

                    biologists could accurately identify the animal. The

                    For better or worse, jawboning has been a hot topic
                    recently, and it's unlikely that interest will fade any time
                    soon. Jawboning, in broad strokes, is when the government
                    pressures a third party to make that third party chill the
                    speech of another instead of going after the speech
                    directly. Because the First Amendment says that the
                    government cannot go after speech directly, this approach
                    can at first seem to be the "one easy trick" for the
                    government to try to affect the speech it wants to affect so
                    that it could get away with it constitutionally. But as the
                    Supreme Court reminded earlier this year in
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/05/31/unanimous-scotus-to-states-no-strong-arming-third-parties-to-silence-critics/"

                    it's not actually constitutional to try this sort of end-run
                    around the First Amendment.

                    [....] there should be concern about Section 512 of the
                    Digital Millennium Copyright Act and how it operates to
                    force intermediaries to act against users and their speech,
                    whether they would want to or not, and whether the targeted
                    speech is wrongful or not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] "Why now?" After all, the DMCA has been working its
                    unconstitutional way for a quarter of a century, and we've
                    been tolerating it. But tolerating the intolerable does not
                    make it tolerable.

                Yep! Just pretend it's a copyright issue and fraudulently file a
                DMCA, under plenty of perjury, to silence what you don't like.

                    However, with the exception of a small amount of A16 chips
                    produced in the Arizona facility, the vast majority of its
                    chips are made elsewhere, including in Taiwan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While there is an intention for Apple chips to be made in
                    the United States via TSMC's Arizona facility, it may not
                    necessarily get to produce cutting-edge chips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Since Taiwan has related regulations to protect its
                    own technologies, TSMC cannot produce 2-nanometer chips
                    overseas currently," Kuo told the Economics Committee in
                    Taipei. "Although TSMC plans to make 2-nanometer chips
                    [abroad] in the future, its core technology will stay in
                    Taiwan."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Under Taiwanese law, domestic chip manufacturers are
                    allowed to produce chips elsewhere. The catch is that they
                    must be at least one generation behind fabrication
                    facilities operated in Taiwan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    TSMC currently plans to make 2-nanometer and more advanced
                    chips at its Arizona facilities by 2030, according to the
                    company's roadmap.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Unless Taiwan changes its laws, TSMC will have to
                    create and use even more advanced manufacturing processes to
                    allow 2-nanometer chip production to start in the United
                    States.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Apple, this means it cannot take advantage of TSMC's
                    newer chip processes for any chips made in the United
                    States. Instead, it will have to rely on TSMC's slightly
                    older tech for US-based production, while maintaining
                    existing out-of-US manufacturing for the fastest, newest
                    chips.

                    Like the forthcoming TrapC fork and the Safe C++ project,
                    Fil-C aims to support memory safety without requiring
                    reeducation in another programming language.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Fil-C has some limitations. Presently, it only works
                    on Linux/x86_64. Also, it's slow – about 1.5x-5x slower than
                    legacy C. That's in part because of its implementation of a
                    pointer encoding method for tracking bounds and types called
                    MonoCaps, and also overhead from calling conventions and
                    dynamic linking that differ from standard C.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The plan to make Fil-C fast is to fix these issues,"
                    explains Pizlo. "I believe that fixing these issues can get
                    Fil-C to be only 1.5x slower than C in the worst cases, with
                    lots of programs being only 1.2x slower. But it'll take some
                    focused compiler/runtime/GC hacking to get there."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Pizlo observes in his presentation that while there
                    have been substantially successful attempts to make C code
                    memory-safe – such as
                    <a href="https://github.com/checkedc/checkedc">CheckedC</a>
                    and

                      >-fbounds-safety</a
                    >
                    – many of these fall short in one way or another,
                    particularly for certain edge cases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    His goal, he says, is to support garbage in, and memory
                    safety out.

                    demand, he added. The low latency should also make possible
                    some of the oft-cited use cases for 5G networks, such as
                    augmented reality and support for autonomous vehicles.

                    "However, the telcos need to avoid costly mistakes made with
                    previous generations of network technology. The harsh
                    reality means they will have to fork out more on capex and
                    rolling out networks," Pescatore warned. "This comes at a
                    time when margins are being squeezed, revenue increases are
                    driven by price rises, and all focus is on driving further
                    efficiencies," he added.

                    Many migratory birds use Earth's magnetic field as a
                    compass, but some can also use information from that field
                    to determine more or less where they are on a mental map.

                    Eurasian reed warblers (<em>Acrocephalus scirpaceus</em>)
                    appear to calculate their geographical position by drawing
                    data from different distances and angles between magnetic
                    fields and the Earth's shape. The findings suggest that the
                    birds use magnetic information as a sort of "GPS" that tells
                    them not only where to go, but where they are initially,
                    says

                    “When we travel, we have a map – which tells us where we are
                    – and we have a compass, which tells us which way to go to
                    reach our destination,” he says. “We don’t think birds have
                    quite this level of accuracy or degree of knowledge of the
                    whole Earth. Even so, they see how magnetic cues change as
                    they move along their normal path – or even if they’re far
                    displaced from that path.”

                  <p>
                    Scientists have known for decades that migratory birds rely
                    on cues from the

                    >
                    to determine which direction to head towards. But figuring
                    out direction using a compass is markedly different from
                    knowing where in the world they are, and scientists still
                    debate about whether – and how – birds figure out their
                    current map position.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, we still don’t fully understand the
                    neurological mechanisms that enable birds to sense these
                    aspects of Earth’s magnetic field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While the research confirms reed warblers rely on
                    these magnetic fields for positioning, it doesn’t mean that
                    all birds do so, he adds. “Not all birds work the same way.”

                Is the world's population destined to shrink? Penn economics
                professor JF-V puts it bluntly: "If you're 55 years or younger,
                you are likely to witness something no human has observed for
                around 60,000 years, not even during was or pandemics: a
                systematic decrease in the world population."
              </p>
              <p>
                His analysis of trends in more than 180 countries suggests that
                in many places, UN estimates of fertility rates are probably too
                high. His calculations suggest that a crucial moment has
                arrived: the global fertility rate, may have already dipped
                below the replacement rate. He allows that the global population
                is still growing, but expects it to peak in roughly 30 years,
                with a steep decline unfolding in its wake. When the transition
                comes—when the world's population eventually tips into
                contraction—he believes the impacts will be disruptive and
                swift.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dramatic declines in childbirths are evident in every region of
                the world, across rich, poor, and middle-income countries alike.
                Shifting social norms are partly responsible, as young people
                don't view parenthood fitting into their lives. "Raising
                children is no longer a priority for many young people," he
                says, "either in the more traditional societies of eastern Asia
                or the more progressive countries of northern Europe."
              </p>
              <p>
                [my aside] Fun fact, his findings parallel those made by my own
                UPenn research group back in 1981. We used a different
                technique, and could only "narrow" the event window down to the
                latter half of this century. What kind of economy will it be
                where there is one worker for every 3 old farts like me?

                    Interviews were conducted with 18 chemists from several
                    subdisciplines of chemistry and include a diversity of
                    demographics on the topic of creativity as seen through the
                    eyes of Eureka moments. The experiences fell within three
                    categories, i.e., (1) analytical problem-solving which can
                    be reconstructed into a series of logical steps that can be
                    identified; (2) memory retrieval processes of previously
                    acquired knowledge; and (3) insights characterized by a
                    sudden and unexpected understanding. There were variations
                    of detail within each category. Suggestions for enhancing
                    the probability of experiencing Eureka moments are provided.

                I've had 2 in my life. 11 y/o me was struggling with fractions
                when suddenly all became clear. Then a few years later while
                teaching myself Z-80 assembly I watched my debugger single step
                into a text string and suddenly how computers execute code
                crystallized. What Eureka moments have you had?

                    The UK's ambitious efforts to mimic the wild success of US
                    research and security outfit DARPA has just a few months to
                    prove its worth, a parliamentary committee heard yesterday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Advanced Research and Invention Agency, or ARIA, was
                    announced in 2021, but was not formally established until
                    January 2023. A product of the Conservative Boris Johnson’s
                    post-Brexit government, the agency is designed to fund
                    transformational research, with a so-called high risk, high
                    reward approach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, Lord Drayson, aka Paul Drayson, electric world land
                    speed record holder and member of the Lords Science and
                    Technology Committee pointed out this week that while Aria's
                    initial £800 million ($1 billion) funding would see it
                    through to the end of the 2025/26 financial year, the Labour
                    government is set decide on any future spending next spring,
                    when it announces the multi-year spending review, setting
                    out plans for 2026–27 to at least 2028–29.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Drayson said the Committee was supportive of Aria and wanted
                    it to succeed, but questioned how it would secure its
                    further when the government is set to decide its future well
                    before its Parliamentary review, due in 2033.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But last month, UK finance minister Rachel Reeves was
                    forced to raise taxes and consider spending cuts in her
                    budget as she struggled to balance the government books,
                    boost the economy, and minimize public debt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In such a climate, political leaders must weigh up the
                    public's appetite for funding high-risk research with no
                    immediate returns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before the Lords' committee, Clifford said: "We recognize
                    that Aria, over the long run, has to provide great value for
                    money, just as any use of public funds needs to, but that
                    that value for money will obviously be measured in a
                    different way, with a different risk appetite, and over a
                    different time frame from the way that many other uses of
                    public funds would. That's why we're so keen to establish
                    core ideas about what failure and success mean for ARIA,
                    what proportion of our programs we expect to succeed,
                    because what we don't want to do is end up in a situation a
                    couple of years where people say, 'When [the] ARIA program
                    failed, does this mean Aria is failing?'"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Aria is often seen as the brainchild of Dominic
                    Cummings, the campaign director of the Conservative "Vote
                    Leave Brexit" campaign and, later, chief advisor to former
                    prime minister Boris Johnson. Reports suggested his WhatsApp
                    handle once said: "Get Brexit Done, then Arpa (Darpa's
                    predecessor)."

                    In a step toward new types of particle physics experiments,
                    scientists cooled and then accelerated a beam of muons. The
                    subatomic particles, heavy cousins of electrons, could be
                    accelerated and slammed together at future particle
                    colliders in hopes of unlocking physics secrets. But first,
                    scientists have to figure out how to give muons a speed
                    boost.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Counterintuitively, that means first slowing muons down.
                    Muons in particle beams initially go every which way. To
                    make a beam suitable for experiments, the particles need to
                    be first slowed and then reaccelerated, all in the same
                    direction. This slowing, or cooling, <a

                    > (<em>SN: 2/5/20</em>). 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The scientists first sent the muons into an aerogel, a
                    lightweight material that slowed the muons and created
                    muonium, an atomlike combination of a positively charged
                    muon and a negatively charged electron. Next, a laser
                    stripped away the electrons, leaving behind cooled muons
                    that electromagnetic fields then accelerated.
                  </p>

                    Muon colliders could generate higher energy collisions than
                    machines that smash protons, which are themselves made up of
                    smaller particles called quarks. Each proton’s energy is
                    divvied up among its quarks, meaning only part of the energy
                    goes into the collision. Muons have no smaller bits inside.
                    And they’re preferable to electrons, which lose energy as
                    they circle an accelerator. Muons aren’t as affected by that
                    issue thanks to their larger mass.

                    When travelers arrived after those employees left in order
                    to pick up their reserved rentals, and no one was around to
                    help them, some decided to help themselves. Approximately 20
                    customers simply grabbed keys for whatever car was available
                    (or seeing which cars had the keys left in them) and went on
                    their way. Note that this Hertz location isn't quite dealing
                    in autonomous rentals yet, so pulling a grab 'n go with the
                    keys was in no way an official option.

                  <p>
                    [...] When the airport realized what was going on, officials
                    tried to contact Hertz but couldn't reach anyone that was
                    on-duty.

                    Singapore Telecommunications over the summer as a "test run
                    by China for further hacks against US telecommunications
                    companies."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Once thought dismantled, Volt Typhoon has returned, more
                    sophisticated and determined than ever," declared Ryan
                    Sherstobitoff, SVP of threat research and intelligence at
                    SecurityScorecard. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a Tuesday
                    <a
                      href="https://securityscorecard.com/blog/botnet-is-back-ssc-strike-team-uncovers-a-renewed-cyber-threat/"
                      >report</a
                    >, Sherstobitoff revealed that the security shop's Threat
                    Research, Intelligence, Knowledge, and Engagement (STRIKE)
                    Team had spotted Volt Typhoon exploiting outdated Cisco
                    RV320/325 routers and Netgear ProSafe routers. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These end-of-life devices become perfect entry points, and
                    in just 37 days, Volt Typhoon compromised 30 percent of
                    visible Cisco RV320/325 routers," Sherstobitoff wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When asked about specific vulnerabilities being abused,
                    Sherstobitoff told <em>The Register</em>: "There are no
                    clear CVEs that Volt is exploiting in current Cisco
                    devices."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, he added, because the routers are end-of-life, the
                    vendor no longer issues security updates. "This leads to
                    increased exploitation of existing ones," Sherstobitoff
                    warned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since the disruption and subsequent rebuilding of the
                    botnet, the threat hunters have seen "a few dozen"
                    compromised devices, he told us. However, he noted, "we have
                    observed changes in command and control servers being
                    deployed into other network providers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The FBI declined to comment on Volt Typhoon's reported
                    resurgence, and the US government's Cybersecurity and
                    Infrastructure Agency did not immediately response to<i
                      >The Register</i

                    The Chinese crew's botnet first came to light in 2023, after
                    Microsoft and intelligence agencies from the Five Eyes
                    nations
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/25/china_volt_typhoon_attacks/"

                    that Volt Typhoon had accessed networks belonging to US
                    critical infrastructure organizations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spy gang, we're told, had built a botnet from Cisco and
                    Netgear routers identified by a self-signed SSL certificate
                    named JDYFJ. This botnet, according to SecurityScorecard,
                    used command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in the
                    Netherlands, Latvia, and Germany to disguise its malicious
                    traffic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By October 2023, Volt Typhoon had taken up occupancy,
                    rent-free, on a compromised VPN device in New Caledonia.
                    This created "a covert bridge between Asia-Pacific and the
                    Americas" that kept "their network alive, hidden from
                    standard detection," Sherstobitoff wrote. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In January 2024, the FBI-led effort disrupted some of Volt
                    Typhoon's infrastructure. However, in the Tuesday report,
                    Sherstobitoff explains the Chinese spies rapidly set up new
                    C2 servers on Digital Ocean, Quadranet, and Vultr and also
                    registered fresh SSL certificates to avoid the prying eyes
                    of law enforcement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As of September, "the botnet persists," he wrote. It uses
                    the JDYFJ cluster to route traffic globally. "Connections
                    from New Caledonia and router nodes remain active for over a
                    month, reinforcing Volt Typhoon's infrastructure."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This report comes as government officials and private
                    security firms alike have noted an uptick in Chinese cyber
                    spy activity on US and global networks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last week, Bloomberg said Volt Typhoon had broken into
                    Singtel's networks before being spotted in June, and had
                    used a web shell in that security breach.

                proposal to collect what they claim is 'anonymized' data.

                    We're currently testing a new open-source tool for Manjaro,
                    that will help us with the development of Manjaro. It's
                    called MDD 26 and it collects some anonymous and impersonal
                    statistics about Manjaro systems.

                    ... you have to get a individual permission and have to ask
                    every single user independent, which is ending in a
                    "license-agreement" similar to ms-windows. otherwise this
                    application is a dead-horse that is violating all and
                    especially the european-data-security-laws. this is
                    something that you have to figure out with @philm and all
                    the other responsible persons at manjaro.

                Manjaro dismisses this claim without actually considering EU
                laws which do cover this very topic. Opt-Out is not permitted.

                So, Soylentils, what is your view on this subject? Do you think
                system metrics are required for anyone producing a distro, even
                it the information is as anonymized as they claim it is? Or is
                this overstepping the mark?

                    Consumer group Which? says the legal action - which it has
                    launched - could result in a £3bn payout if it is
                    successful, with the average customer getting around £70.

                    Apple has rejected the suggestion its practices are
                    anti-competitive, saying users are not required to use
                    iCloud. It said many customers rely on third-party
                    alternatives, and insists it "works hard to make data
                    transfer as easy as possible".

                  <p>
                    It is another example of the "growing tide of large class
                    actions against big tech" which has "operated without
                    sufficient constraint", Toby Starr from legal firm Humphries
                    Kerstetter told the BBC.

                    "Although most of these claims are in their infancy and take
                    a long time to resolve, there will be more decisions coming
                    out over the next couple of years and there will be
                    settlements - these will start to affect the tech giants'
                    businesses," said Mr Starr.

                    Users of Apple products get a small amount of digital
                    storage for free – and after that are encouraged to pay to
                    use its iCloud service to back up photos, videos, messages,
                    contacts and all the other content which lives on their
                    device.

                  <p>
                    Prices for this storage range from £0.99 a month for 50GB of
                    space to £54.99 a month for 12TB.

                  <p>
                    Apple does not allow rival storage services full access to

                    Which? says over a period of nine years dating back to 2015
                    Apple has been effectively locking people into its services
                    - and then overcharging them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "By bringing this claim, Which? is showing big corporations
                    like Apple that they cannot rip off UK consumers without
                    facing repercussions," the body's chief executive Anabel
                    Hoult said.

                    "Taking this legal action means we can help consumers to get

                    the future and create a better, more competitive market."

                  <p>Apple has strongly denied Which's accusations.</p>

                    The Guardian has announced it will no longer post content on
                    Elon Musk's social media platform, X, from its official
                    accounts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an announcement to readers, the news organisation said it
                    considered the benefits of being on the platform formerly
                    called Twitter were now outweighed by the negatives, citing
                    the "often disturbing content" found on it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We wanted to let readers know that we will no longer post
                    on any official Guardian editorial accounts on the social
                    media site X," the Guardian said.<br />...<br />Responding
                    to the announcement, Musk posted on X that the Guardian was
                    "irrelevant" and a "laboriously vile propaganda machine".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last year National Public Radio (NPR), the non-profit US
                    media organisation, stopped posting on X after the social
                    media platform labelled it as "state-affiliated media". PBS,
                    a US public TV broadcaster, suspended its posts for the same
                    reason.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This month the Berlin film festival said it was quitting X,
                    without citing an official reason, and last month the North
                    Wales police force said it had stopped using X because it
                    was "no longer consistent with our values".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In August the Royal National orthopaedic hospital said it
                    was leaving X, citing an "increased volume of hate speech
                    and abusive commentary" on the platform.

                    Elkies, a prominent number theorist, didn't intend to break

                  <p>
                    Imagine starting with a simple surface, a flat plane. You
                    can slice it into infinitely many straight lines, laid side
                    by side. Depending on how you make your slices, the lines
                    you end up with will be defined by different equations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similarly, there are more complicated, curvy surfaces that,
                    when sliced up, yield infinitely many elliptic curves.
                    Mathematicians have been using these surfaces to find
                    higher-rank elliptic curves since the 1950s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Elkies realized that his K3 surfaces were strange enough to
                    give him access to even more exotic curves. In 2006, he
                    sliced a particular K3 surface in just the right way and
                    found among the slices an elliptic curve that he could show
                    had a rank of at least 28 — beating the previous record of
                    24. It was an exciting moment for elliptic curve experts,
                    who believed an explosion of record breakers might follow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead, nothing happened. Elkies' record stood for nearly
                    two decades — a noticeable departure from the relatively
                    steady record-setting rate that mathematicians had enjoyed
                    since the 1970s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Was it perhaps a sign that rank could be limited after all —
                    that the hunters were beginning to close in on their last
                    few prey? Or was it just a reflection of the difficulty of
                    the task?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Elkies announced his discovery in 2006, Zev Klagsbrun
                    was an undergraduate student at Queens College in New York.
                    One of his professors, who had competed against Elkies in a
                    high school math competition in the 1980s — Elkies won —
                    told him about the new record-breaking curve during office
                    hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Klagsbrun was intrigued. Years later, he returned to the
                    result, proving that so long as a widely believed conjecture
                    is true, Elkies' curve has a rank of precisely 28. So when
                    he ran into Elkies at a conference in 2019, he saw an
                    opportunity to push the result even further. Though a bit
                    intimidated — "It's difficult to keep up with him,"
                    Klagsbrun said — he convinced Elkies to return to the search
                    for new curves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I was like, 'Hey, I've got access to some computing power.
                    I'm willing to write fast code. Search with me! Show me your
                    secrets!'" Klagsbrun said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They went back to Elkies' K3 surface. Eighteen years
                    earlier, he had sliced it up in a way that gave him a pile
                    of infinitely many curves. These curves were already quite
                    exotic, but he could only guarantee that they had a rank of
                    at least 17. He still needed an outlier to break the record
                    of 24. Since he couldn't just calculate the rank of every
                    curve in his pile, he used a well-known computational method
                    to determine which among millions of them seemed most likely
                    to have an anomalously high rank. He then calculated those
                    ranks by hand, one by one, until he found his rank 28
                    winner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Klagsbrun could now offer a faster computational method for
                    sifting through the contenders. While Elkies had only been
                    able to look through millions of curves, Klagsbrun could
                    handle tens of trillions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This wider search unearthed many curves in Elkies' old pile
                    that exhibited some unusual properties, but none of them
                    broke his 2006 record. The pair decided to move on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Four years passed. Then, a few months ago, Elkies and
                    Klagsbrun crossed paths once more at a conference and got to
                    talking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They set out to slice the K3 surface in a different way,
                    getting a new pile of curves to work with. But there were
                    hundreds of ways they could slice it, and most of those
                    slicing methods seemed unlikely to produce the curve they
                    sought.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, entirely by accident, they found a slicing method
                    that, like Elkies' previous one, gave them a pile of curves,
                    all guaranteed to have a rank of at least 17. It seemed more
                    likely than the other approaches to contain a hidden gem.
                    Sure enough, using Klagsbrun's more powerful computational
                    technique, they found within that pile an elliptic curve
                    with a rank of at least 29. This elliptic curve has the most
                    complicated set of rational solutions ever seen:
                    Mathematicians need at least 29 independent points to
                    characterize them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The curve's equation, when written as <em>y</em
                    ><sup>2</sup> = <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> + <em>Ax</em> +
                    <em>B</em>, has values of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> that are
                    each over 60 digits long. The 29 independent rational
                    solutions that Elkies and Klagsbrun pinpointed involve
                    numbers that are similarly huge.

                    British telecom giant O2 announced what could be the first
                    deployment of conversational AI specifically designed to
                    counter telephone fraud in the UK telecommunications
                    sector.<br />
                    <br />
                    The hero: a clueless grandma who endlessly and frustratingly
                    digresses while idiot scammers attempt to hoodwink her out
                    of money.<br />
                    <br />
                    The system, dubbed "Daisy," uses AI models to snare
                    fraudsters in meandering conversations lasting up to 40
                    minutes, potentially preventing millions in losses across
                    the network's 24 million mobile customers. The tool operates
                    autonomously around the clock, requiring no human
                    intervention to maintain conversations with suspected
                    scammers.<br />
                    <br />
                    <i
                      >"Stop calling me dear, you stupid [expletive
                      deleted]!"</i
                    >
                    one exasperated tele-scammer shouted in a video O2 aired to
                    show off its new tool.<br />

                    <i>"Got it, dear!"</i> the kindly AI grandma replied.<br />
                    <br />
                    Here's how it works. When a user receives a scam call, they
                    forward the call to the number 7726, which had been used as
                    a hotline to report fraud. From there, Daisy employs a
                    custom large language model with a "personality layer" that
                    generates real-time responses to the scammers.<br />
                    <br />
                    The system transcribes incoming voice to text, processes it
                    through the AI model so responses are context-relevant, and
                    converts the text output back to speech, creating
                    natural-sounding conversations that can include fictional
                    personal details and bank information.<br />
                    <br />
                    It's designed to exploit fraudsters' targeting of elderly
                    victims by presenting as a chatty grandmother, complete with
                    meandering stories about family and knitting.

                    Digital software locks have just become flimsier in Canada
                    with the passage of a pair of laws allowing for their bypass

                    Royal assent was granted to two right to repair bills last
                    week that amend Canada's Copyright Act to allow the

                  <p>
                    The pair of bills allow device owners to not only repair
                    their own stuff regardless of how a program is written to
                    prevent such non-OEM measures, but said owners can also make
                    their devices work with third-party components without
                    needing to go through the manufacturer to do so.

                    [...] TPMs can take a number of forms, from simple
                    administrative passwords to encryption, registration keys,
                    or even the need for a physical object like a USB dongle to
                    unlock access to copyrighted components of a device's
                    software. Most commercially manufactured devices with
                    proprietary embedded software include some form of TPM, and
                    neither C-244 nor C-294 place any restrictions on the use of

                    Canadians in a similar position to US repair advocates, who
                    in 2021 saw the US Copyright Office loosen DMCA restrictions

                    on these machines, the ruling does not allow us to share or
                    distribute the tools necessary to do so," iFixit director of
                    sustainability Elizabeth Chamberlain said last month. "The
                    ruling doesn't change the underlying statute making it
                    illegal to share or sell tools that bypass software locks.
                    This leaves most of the repair work inaccessible to the

                    Pizza Hut has melded the disparate worlds of bready, cheesy
                    foodstuffs and console gaming with the new PIZZAWRMR. This
                    innovation is designed to sit atop your Sony PlayStation 5
                    console and keep your takeaway of choice piping hot while
                    you enjoy your heated gaming session. This isn't a new
                    retail product or a giveaway, though. Pizza Hut Canada has
                    made the 3D printing source files free for anyone who signs
                    up to download, modify, and print.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The PIZZAWRMR design is inspired by the pizza-centric
                    restaurant's red roof. The lid opens laptop-style for
                    convenient pizza slice access. According to Pizza Hut,
                    several slices of pizza can fit into the top box. Diagrams
                    show that the hot exhaust from the console is channeled
                    under and into the pizza area, which is the appliance of
                    "science and engineering for the greater good," says the
                    Pizza Hut marketing team.

                It's that time of the year again. A compilation of the most
                common passwords. Nothing has changed. No lessons have been
                learned. Either people don't care or they, still, just doesn't
                know any better.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is the common list but it can also be shown on a per
                country level. It doesn't really make it better. Idiocy is
                evenly spread across the lands.

                    NordStellar—analyzing people's password habits, and guess
                    what? They're still really bad.

                  <p>
                    And we're not just talking about personal passwords here.
                    This time, we also put together a list of the most common
                    corporate passwords to see how they compare to those used in
                    everyday life.

              <h2>We've Done It</h2>
              <p>
                After almost 2 years and a lot of hard work by many people, we
                have finally achieved what we set out to do. On Wednesday, the
                Linode servers were decommissioned, and the site is now
                completely independent and running on its own hardware. All the
                site data and the domains belong to the community - yes, you own
                this site.
              </p>
              <p>
                It could not have been possible without the dedication of quite
                a few people - some of whom have not made it to today. It wasn't
                pleasant and it wasn't easy. There were numerous meetings to
                create a new set of Bylaws. That in itself took many months of
                often acrimonious debate. Everyone wanted the same end, but they
                were not happy with how it was being achieved. In the end, as is
                always the case, it required a lot of compromise, and it meant
                we needed to say goodbye to the old way of doing things. So to
                all of those who participated in those meetings: mechanicjay,
                AudioGuy, Deucalion, Fnord666, MartyB, Separatrix, cmn32480,
                kolie, hubie, mrpg, requerdanos, fab23, chromas, fliptop,
                dx3bydt3, tedious, cosurgi, Runaway1956, and even aristarchus,
                and many that I have probably missed out, a huge thank you from
                me. And if I have missed you out then that is entirely my fault
                and I apologise!
              </p>
              <p>
                The Bylaws dictate how the business will be managed. They do not
                contain any rules about how the site will be used, or what is
                permitted in submissions or discussions and what is not, or any
                of those things that tend to interest the community. But there
                are some unique differences in our Bylaws from those previously.
                The Board (which I will get to in a moment) manage this site on
                your behalf. While they handle routine matters as appropriate to
                their post, many actions require them to seek the agreement of
                the community. You will have a say in major decisions. After
                all, you own the site. The data cannot be used for any purpose
                other than maintaining this site without a majority decision of
                the community.
              </p>
              <p>
                So having created the Bylaws, we could apply to create a
                company. This was necessary so that the new company (Soylent
                Phoenix) could receive whatever assets the original company
                (SoylentNews PBC) was prepared to transfer. For legal reasons,
                the Board members cannot be anonymous; they have to sign various
                pieces of legal documentation to create the company. So I asked
                for volunteers from the community. More than we needed stepped
                forward and so the business was created. The Chairman of the
                Board is OregonJohn (6105), the Treasurer is Dale (539) (and he
                is actually a qualified accountant!), and the Secretary is
                holeinone (17639). They have also been working hard on your
                behalf setting up the company, creating Stripe accounts,
                managing the current funds, and filling in the paperwork that is
                associated with a business. Technically the Board is a temporary
                one because they do not yet have the approval of the community.
                But that is built into the Bylaws, and it allows us to keep
                moving forward until their posts are confirmed by the community,
                or challenged by someone else who believes they should be
                allowed to do the job.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next came the transfer of assets. Like all things this did not
                go as smoothly as everyone had hoped it would. Quite
                understandably, it was necessary for everything to be
                accountable and legal, and to look after everyone's interests.
                Again, it was only by having some tough discussions and making
                compromises on both sides that anything has actually been
                achieved. So another thank-you to NCommander and Matt Angel. I
                think we have a solution which, while not meeting all of our
                initial dreams, is one that we can live with for the future. The
                site never squandered money and there is nothing to suggest that
                your donations have been misused.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will probably now all be aware that two people have donated
                hardware and a data connection at no cost to the site. Those
                people are kolie and fliptop, and they have my sincere thanks.
                Kolie's server is the one that you are using at the moment to
                read this Meta. In fact, it is handling all of the site
                including email, IRC, DNS, Varnish, the database, etc. etc.
                Fliptop's server is currently an off-site backup for our data
                but will probably require a bit of expansion before it will cope
                with the full Docker installation. You will also be aware that,
                over the recent weeks and months, kolie has built the entire
                software infrastructure into Docker containers, moving each
                function one by one from the Linode servers and incrementally
                adding it to our own hardware. He has put many man hours into
                this task and I for one have enjoyed working with him - although
                my contribution has been considerably less than his! Again, I
                offer my grateful thanks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, none of this would have been possible without the
                community being tolerant and understanding as we have
                encountered each unexpected obstacle. The community has, in
                fact, grown slightly in the last 2 years, but it remains at
                roughly 10% of what it once was. I thank you all for making this
                possible. Welcome to <b>your</b> site.
              </p>
              <p>And now for something completely different....</p>
              <h2>Community Representatives</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                To provide the community with more visibility regarding the
                actions of staff and the reason and justification for those
                actions, we have created 3 posts which will act as Community
                Representatives. Their prime role is to provide the community
                with the assurance that management is behaving responsibly and
                within the rules governing the site, and for the community to
                have a focus when they have concerns regarding what is going on
                behind the 'curtains'. They will act as your voice in
                discussions and decisions. They will have full access to staff
                discussions but will only have limited access, and then only
                when absolutely necessary, to the data stored in the database.
                We have had 3 volunteers for these posts for many months, but I
                will provide more details once I have confirmed that they are
                still volunteering for the role, and when we have hammered out
                the working procedures that must be adopted for this system to
                function correctly.
              </p>
              <h2>TOR</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                We now have TOR up and running again - we had it quite a few
                years ago and then it disappeared. Eventually, the link will be
                in the SoylentNews side panel on your screen, but for now it is
                cut and paste:

              <h2>Elections</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                As I mentioned earlier, technically the current board is
                temporary. If you wish to stand for a post then you may do so.
                We will be asking for nominations in the near future. However,
                remember that you cannot remain anonymous as your name has to be
                recorded on the official business records.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will provide you with a Meta page should you wish to explain
                to the community why you believe that they should vote for you.
                The method of voting will be 1 vote per active account, which
                must be in good standing (i.e. meet a minimum karma level and
                not be currently banned). The software that will be used is
                still under consideration as the original voting software was
                written and operated by audioguy who is not currently taking an
                active part in the site management.
              </p>
              <p>
                You cannot nominate someone else for a post. They have to put
                themselves forward as a candidate. You can of course vote for
                them should they do so.
              </p>
              <h2>realDonaldTrump Account</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                Accounts that have been dormant for over 5 years quickly attract
                attention when they suddenly re-appear. In recent years we have
                seen attempts to resurrect old accounts, sometimes by people
                other than the original owner. There is an option built in to
                Rehash which is named "Force User to Verify Account" (FUVA) and
                it appears on the user's administration page. It simply resets
                the password and sends the new password to the email address
                that we hold for that account in the database. The account
                holder can then reset the password to something of their own
                choosing and everything works as it should. Currently, it is
                invoked automatically after the 5-year point if the account
                becomes active again. About a week ago the "realDonaldTrump"
                (rDT) account suddenly sprang back into life, having been
                dormant since 2019, and for the most part it was welcomed by the
                community. However, by making a comment the FUVA triggered.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think that the account holder has either forgotten how to
                access his email or the email address has lapsed for some other
                reason. So the account is now stuck in limbo. Without a working
                email contact we cannot send the new password to the account
                holder. I do NOT want to know who the account owner is. However,
                they must provide a working email address, which can be a
                temporary or throw-away address, and they must provide
                sufficient detail about the account to prove that they are the
                true account owners. The site can be reactivated as a parody
                account which will have specific restrictions associated with
                it.
              </p>
              <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                Although the site is now independent and 'under new management'
                there is still much that remains to be done.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  For the present the rules that we have inherited will remain
                  in force, but they will have to be rewritten and approved by
                  the community to take us into the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We will need people to assist with the sys-admin role - which
                  is more Docker management than anything else. Interested
                  people do not have to currently know or use Docker, I am sure
                  that we can provide guidance on acquiring those skills and
                  then explaining the current site structure. It is
                  <b>much</b> simpler than it once was.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We are investigating how to create a separate environment for
                  both testing code before it is integrated into the main site
                  and as a training facility.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As ever, we need your support by providing submissions and by
                  participating in the discussions. There are 23 submissions in

              <p>
                Over the last week or two the level of spamming and abuse has
                significantly reduced. However, the reasons for this are
                unclear, and it might not indicate a permanent or even
                long-lasting change. If the low level continues for a
                significant period (certainly into the New Year) then it might
                be possible to re-admit ACs to the whole site again. This is
                something that is we all want to see, and it would be a welcome
                enhancement to the site. However, it depends entirely on those
                few individuals who account for the vast majority of the spam
                and abuse.
              </p>
              <p>
                If ACs are allowed back onto the full site then any permanent
                return is entirely dependent on the spamming remaining at a very
                low level, and for personal attacks to be rare events.

                    Bluesky is a decentralized microblogging social networking
                    service primarily operated by Bluesky Social, PBC. It was
                    created as a proof of concept for the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol"
                      >AT Protocol</a
                    >, a communication protocol for decentralized social
                    networks. The platform is analogous to Twitter, where users
                    can share short text posts, images, and video, and can like,
                    repost, or reply to any given post. Bluesky Social claims
                    the social app was "designed to not be controlled by a
                    single company" through the use of the AT Protocol as its
                    foundation. Bluesky Social promotes a composable user
                    experience and algorithmic choice as core features of
                    Bluesky, offering a "marketplace of algorithms" where users
                    can choose or create feeds to customize their experience.
                    Bluesky offers a DNS-based domain name handle system through
                    the AT Protocol, allowing users to verify an account's
                    legitimacy and identity after signing up by proving
                    ownership of a domain name without involving Bluesky Social
                    in the verification process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bluesky was originally created as a research initiative in
                    2019 by then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to investigate the
                    possibility of decentralizing the platform. This initiative
                    resulted in the hiring of Jay Graber in August 2021 to lead
                    the Bluesky project and what is now the AT Protocol, with
                    initial funding provided by Twitter. After the acquisition
                    of Twitter by Elon Musk, Twitter severed all legal and
                    financial ties with Bluesky Social. This led to the rapid
                    development of the Bluesky social app and the AT Protocol as
                    a minimum viable product, initially launching as an
                    invite-only beta. The social app opened registrations to the
                    general public in February 2024. Bluesky is considered a
                    major competitor to Twitter following the acquisition of the
                    platform by Elon Musk, alongside Threads and Mastodon

                    If you came of age in the 1960s or 1970s and then later
                    became an EE, chances are you're more than casually
                    acquainted with Heathkit. Many engineers started their
                    budding careers by building one or more kits made by the
                    Heath Company. I certainly did. When I stumbled across a
                    brief interview with Chas Gilmore, who joined the Heath
                    Company in 1966 as a design engineer and worked at the Heath
                    Company on and off for more than two decades, eventually
                    becoming VP of product development, marketing, and sales, I
                    knew I needed to interview him.

                    Launched earlier this year, the trial tests ways of
                    automatically detecting age. The trial includes evaluating
                    methods like biometric facial analysis, voice analysis, and
                    behavioral data to estimate user age without relying solely
                    on traditional identification.

                    "But let's be clear too, these platforms know their users

                    understand their habits, their capabilities, what sort of
                    content should be driven to them, and what their behaviors

                    Massachusetts has passed a statewide ballot initiative that
                    gives rideshare drivers the opportunity to unionize while
                    remaining independent contractors. The initiative was
                    brought forward by the Service Employees International Union
                    and the International Association of Machinists and
                    Aerospace Workers. It passed with a narrow margin of about
                    54 percent of the vote.

                      >measure</a
                    >
                    will allow the state's 70,000 rideshare drivers to form
                    unions and leverage collective bargaining power, which is
                    not permitted for independent contractors under the National
                    Labor Relations Act. These workers can unionize if they
                    receive signatures from at least 25 percent of active
                    drivers in Massachusetts. The initiative also creates a
                    hearing process so that drivers for companies such as Lyft
                    and Uber can bring complaints about unfair work practices to
                    a state board. However, the ballot initiative does not
                    contain language about strike protections. It also does not
                    extend to food delivery drivers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Uber and Lyft did not actively campaign against the
                    Massachusetts measure, but they have raised concerns about
                    the specific language. Some labor advocates also opposed the
                    initiative, cautioning that it could hamper efforts for
                    rideshare drivers to win recognition as full-time employees.
                    "We're not against unionization," Kelly Cobb-Lemire, an
                    organizer with Massachusetts Drivers United, told
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/technology/uber-lyft-drivers-unionize-massachusetts.html"
                      ><em>The New York Times</em></a
                    >. "But we don't feel this goes far enough."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Independent contractors often are not protected by federal
                    or state labor laws because they aren't full-time employees.
                    The Massachusetts ballot measure could create a precedent
                    for other states to offer unionization options for gig
                    workers. California has been a battleground for labor
                    protections for gig workers who drive for Uber and Lyft for
                    several years. Most recently, a court

                    But while tunneling transistors can enable sharp switching
                    slopes, they typically operate with low current, which
                    hampers the performance of an electronic device. Higher
                    current is necessary to create powerful transistor switches
                    for demanding applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using tools at MIT.nano, MIT’s state-of-the-art facility for
                    nanoscale research, the engineers were able to carefully
                    control the 3D geometry of their transistors, creating
                    vertical nanowire heterostructures with a diameter of only 6
                    nanometers. They believe these are the smallest 3D
                    transistors reported to date.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such precise engineering enabled them to achieve a sharp
                    switching slope and high current simultaneously. This is
                    possible because of a phenomenon called quantum confinement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Quantum confinement occurs when an electron is confined to a
                    space that is so small that it can’t move around. When this
                    happens, the effective mass of the electron and the
                    properties of the material change, enabling stronger
                    tunneling of the electron through a barrier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because the transistors are so small, the researchers can
                    engineer a very strong quantum confinement effect while also
                    fabricating an extremely thin barrier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “We have a lot of flexibility to design these material
                    heterostructures so we can achieve a very thin tunneling
                    barrier, which enables us to get very high current,” Shao
                    says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers are now striving to enhance their
                    fabrication methods to make transistors more uniform across
                    an entire chip. With such small devices, even a 1-nanometer
                    variance can change the behavior of the electrons and affect
                    device operation. They are also exploring vertical
                    fin-shaped structures, in addition to vertical nanowire
                    transistors, which could potentially improve the uniformity
                    of devices on a chip.
