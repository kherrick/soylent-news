                    Microsoft has stopped developing VBScript after a 27-year
                    relationship and plans to remove the scripting language
                    entirely in a future Windows release.

                    "VBScript is being deprecated," Microsoft said. "In future
                    releases of Windows, VBScript will be available as a feature

                    Only a month ago, Microsoft announced the pending retirement

                  <p>
                    VBScript debuted in 1996 and its most recent release,
                    version 5.8, dates back

                    used among system administrators to automate tasks until it
                    was eclipsed by PowerShell, which debuted in 2006.

                    "Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition brings active
                    scripting to a wide variety of environments, including Web
                    client scripting in Microsoft Internet Explorer and Web
                    server scripting in Microsoft Internet Information Service,"
                    Redmond explains in its help documentation.

                  <p>
                    Unfortunately, Microsoft never managed to get other browser
                    makers to support VBScript, so outside of
                    Microsoft-exclusive environments, web developers tended to
                    favor JavaScript for client-side tasks.

                    One of the most vital parts of the Psyche mission will be
                    getting the spacecraft to this distant asteroid and then
                    keeping it in place so its scientific instruments can do

                    7.8 feet (4.9 by 2.2 by 2.4 meters), will depend on a solar
                    electric propulsion system that captures sunlight with its
                    large solar arrays and then converts it to electric and
                    magnetic fields. These fields accelerate charged atoms of
                    the propellant xenon ,  which is commonly found in plasma

                    frictionless environment of space, is enough to propel the
                    spacecraft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even with these revolutionary "Hall-effect thrusters" —
                    which, so far, have been used to get only as far as the moon
                    — the spacecraft's journey to the vicinity of Jupiter won't
                    be a 'straight shot." Instead, it will require a
                    gravity-assisted slingshot maneuver around Mars in 2026, and
                    Psyche will arrive at its metal-rich asteroid target in
                    August 2029.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spacecraft will then make orbits of the asteroid at a
                    distance of around 430 miles (700 km), which will decrease
                    as the mission proceeds. The spacecraft will use
                    progressively closer orbital periods ,  or "regimes ,"  to
                    investigate different characteristics of the asteroid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During its first orbital regime (A), lasting 56 days, the
                    spacecraft will use its magnetometer to search Psyche for an
                    ancient magnetic field, which would provide evidence that
                    the asteroid was once a planetary body. As the spacecraft
                    does this, its multispectral imager will assess the
                    topography of Psyche's surface. This will continue as the
                    NASA orbiter draws closer to the asteroid, hopefully
                    revealing more details of these characteristics,
                    particularly during the next two orbital regimes (B1 and
                    B2), which will last 192 days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moving even closer to the asteroid, during the 100-day
                    orbital regime C, Psyche's telecommunications system, which
                    sends data to Earth and receives commands from ground
                    control via radio waves, will be used to investigate the
                    gravitational influence of the metal-rich asteroid. This
                    could help better constrain its mass and density and thus
                    the asteroid's interior composition and structure.

                    In the short story Chains (1929), the Hungarian writer
                    Frigyes Karinthy described a game where a group of people
                    were discussing how the members of the human society were
                    closer together than ever before. To prove this point, one
                    participant proposes that any person out of the entire Earth
                    population (around 1.8 billion at that time) could be
                    reached using nothing except each personal network of
                    acquaintances, betting that the resulting chain would be of
                    no more than five individuals. The story coined the
                    expression "six degrees of separation" to reflect the idea
                    that all people of the world are six or fewer social
                    connections apart from each other. The concept was later
                    generalized to that of "small-world" networks, where the
                    maximal social distance (the diameter of the network) scales
                    logarithmically, rather than linearly, with the size of the
                    population.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] One of the most intriguing and captivating features of
                    social networks is that they are organized so that no
                    individual is more than six connections apart from any
                    other, an empirical regularity known as the six degrees of
                    separation. Why social networks have this ultrasmall world
                    organization—where the diameter of a graph of the network is
                    independent of the network size over several orders of
                    magnitude—is still unknown. Our study shows that this
                    property is the direct consequence of the dynamical
                    evolution of any network structure where individuals weigh
                    their aspiration to improve their centrality against the
                    costs incurred in forming or maintaining connections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We look at the evolution of a graph whose growth is governed
                    by a simple compensation rule. This rule balances the cost
                    incurred by nodes in maintaining connections and the benefit
                    accrued by the chosen links. In this case, the graph's
                    asymptotic equilibrium state (a Nash equilibrium, where no
                    further actions would produce more benefit than cost)
                    features a diameter that, irrespective of the network's
                    initial connectivity structure, does not depend on the
                    system's size and is equal to six.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our study points out that evolutionary rules of the kind
                    traditionally associated with human cooperation and altruism
                    can in fact account also for the emergence of the six
                    degrees of separation in social networks.

                    [...] Part of the draw of Imagetwin, specialists say, is
                    that it looks for duplications in two ways. The software
                    makes "something like a fingerprint" for every image in a
                    paper, says Patrick Starke, one of its developers. It then
                    scans the entire paper for repeats of that fingerprint. It
                    also scans its large database to see whether that
                    fingerprint appears in past papers — a process that takes
                    only five to ten seconds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The end goal, Christopher says, is to incorporate AI
                    tools such as Imagetwin into the paper-review process, just
                    as many publishers routinely use software to scan text for
                    plagiarism. But AI on its own isn't enough. "You have to use
                    your own expertise and question these things. None of the
                    flags you receive [from Imagetwin] are a definite 'This is
                    fraud,'" she says.

                  <p>
                    [...] Christopher hopes that the roll-out of more AI tools
                    could democratize the ability for journals to screen papers.
                    "I think we need to shed the idea that it's a luxury — it
                    actually adds value to the journal."

                    That sort of potential attack means that Microsoft needs to
                    be very careful exactly what to enable in Windows Copilot,
                    and how to enable it. Unfortunately, the strange-loop nature
                    of AI chatbots means that it's difficult – maybe even
                    impossible – to game out every possible attack scenario.
                    Human language is just too weird, and the AI chatbots
                    themselves are still very poorly understood.

                    Microsoft has rushed to get Copilot into its operating
                    system. Nadella and co. feel as though they've stumbled on
                    the best opportunity they've ever had to checkmate Google –
                    the boogeyman they imagine as their biggest competitor. But

              <h3>Copilot Deficit. MS Losing Money Per User.</h3>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                Microsoft is apparently losing $20 per user per month that
                installs and pays the subscription fee ($10/month) to use
                Copilot. You have got to be fairly desperate to gain market
                share if you are willing to sell it at a loss. Or they want to
                hook customers early to later hike the price, as per usual.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps more importantly, are you getting your subfees worth of
                code or help per month?<br />Is the loss real tho? After all
                they are hooking a developer to their service and they are
                gaining code and data every month to feed into their machine.
                Most of that code is probably from the Copilot so it's feeding
                itself on itself, creating delusions or AI induced
                hallucinations. Eventually it will start to believe it's own
                code.

                    As the WSJ notes, individuals pay $10 per month for GitHub
                    Copilot, but multiple sources told it that the service loses
                    an average of $20 per user per month, with some users
                    costing Microsoft as much as $80 per month. So it's likely
                    that this situation played a role in the company's decision
                    to charge a lot more for the AI capabilities it will soon
                    provide via Microsoft 365 Copilot. That service will cost
                    customers $30 per user per month on top of the normal
                    monthly Microsoft 365 subscription fee (which varies by
                    tier). It's not coincidental that Google will charge an
                    identical additional per-user fee for its similar Duet AI
                    offering.

                ATARI releasing a "new" game for the 2600 console. 46 years in
                development, there wasn't just active development, have got to
                be some kind of record in and by itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sold in the classic box and cartridge form. Clearly targeting
                the collector-market since it's just 500 copies. I'm not sure
                you'll get your $60 worth tho. It doesn't look very good or
                appear to be overly interesting as a game. It's not Pitfall.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps this isn't a surprise, or should come as one. After all
                it seems the game market today is in large just remaking the
                same titles over and over again, remaking and "updating"
                previous titles etc. In that sense starting to release games for
                long dead consoles is perhaps not that far fetched.

                    Scientists have for the first time observed the early
                    universe running in extreme slow motion, unlocking one of
                    the mysteries of Einstein's expanding universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Einstein's general theory of relativity means that we should
                    observe the distant – and hence ancient – universe running
                    much slower than the present day. However, peering back that
                    far in time has proven elusive. Scientists have now cracked
                    that mystery by using quasars as 'clocks'.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Looking back to a time when the universe was just over a
                    billion years old, we see time appearing to flow five times
                    slower," said lead author of the study, Professor Geraint
                    Lewis from the School of Physics and Sydney Institute for
                    Astronomy at the University of Sydney.

                    "If you were there, in this infant universe, one second
                    would seem like one second – but from our position, more
                    than 12 billion years into the future, that early time
                    appears to drag."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Thanks to Einstein, we know that time and space are
                    intertwined and, since the dawn of time in the singularity
                    of the Big Bang, the universe has been expanding," Professor
                    Lewis said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This expansion of space means that our observations of the
                    early universe should appear to be much slower than time
                    flows today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Professor Lewis worked with astro-statistician Dr
                    Brewer to examine details of 190 quasars observed over two
                    decades. Combining the observations taken at different
                    colours (or wavelengths) – green light, red light and into
                    the infrared – they were able to standardise the 'ticking'
                    of each quasar. Through the application of Bayesian
                    analysis, they found the expansion of the universe imprinted
                    on each quasar's ticking.

                  <p>
                    "With these exquisite data, we were able to chart the tick
                    of the quasar clocks, revealing the influence of expanding
                    space," Professor Lewis said.

                    Blanchard said the fees weren't for litigation "that's going
                    to go for several years," but instead were for "one day of

                    Tech jobs, once a fairly safe and lucrative bet, have become
                    more elusive. In 2022 and 2023, tech companies around the
                    world laid off more than 400,000 workers, according to
                    <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/">Layoffs.fyi</a>, a site that
                    tracks job losses across the industry. Tens of thousands of
                    those cuts have come from huge employers like Meta and
                    Amazon, and some firms have instituted hiring freezes. The
                    layoffs have been particularly brutal for immigrant workers,
                    who have been left scrambling for sponsorship in the US
                    after losing work.

                    The controversy at the Grace Hopper Celebration shows the
                    fallout of those job losses, as women and non-binary people
                    still struggle to find equal footing in an industry
                    dominated by men. Women made up just a third of those

                    Elias Ingebrand let ten dementia sufferers, eight of whom
                    lived in care facilities, try using computer tablets for the
                    first time in their lives. A staff member or a loved one was
                    there for support, but the only instruction given to
                    participants was to use the tablet as they wished. It soon
                    turned out that the device made them curious.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I was rather surprised at this. I may have expected that it
                    would just lie there and that they would talk about
                    something else, but we saw that they focused their attention
                    on it," he says.<br />[...] A woman who used to do
                    orienteering spontaneously started using the tablet to check
                    competition results. A man who used to be restless and
                    aggressive learned how to navigate to the Open Archive of
                    SVT, the Swedish public television broadcaster. After a
                    while, staff noted that he would sit and watch for a long
                    time, calmly and focused. This was a side of him they had
                    never seen before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Elias Ingebrand was surprised to find that people with
                    dementia could solve the mysteries of the tablet also
                    without help from staff or loved ones, by collaborating and
                    learning from each other. Also in this context, they managed
                    to focus on the task at hand. As far as he knows, no-one has
                    studied collaboration between dementia sufferers before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "My thesis has an impact on how we look at people with
                    dementia. They are not to be treated as children, but as
                    people who still have a will and an incentive to do things.
                    This is ultimately about having the opportunity to
                    participate in meaningful activities based on the person's
                    own interests and desires."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This of course presents a challenge to care facility staff,
                    who are often too busy to sit down with just one person for
                    any length of time. Letting people with dementia do things
                    in collaboration could be a solution worth trying. And even
                    though this study is about computer tablets, Elias Ingebrand
                    believes that its results are valid also for other forms of
                    learning.

                    University of Cambridge psychologists have developed the
                    first validated "misinformation susceptibility test".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The quick two-minute quiz gives a solid indication of how
                    vulnerable a person is to being duped by the kind of
                    fabricated news that is flooding online spaces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The test, proven to work through a series of experiments
                    involving over 8,000 participants taking place over two
                    years, has been deployed by polling organisation YouGov to
                    determine how susceptible Americans are to fake headlines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first survey to use the new 20-point test, called 'MIST'
                    by researchers and developed using an early version of
                    ChatGPT, has found that – on average – adult US citizens
                    correctly classified two-thirds (65%) of headlines they were
                    shown as either real or fake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the polling found that younger adults are worse
                    than older adults at identifying false headlines, and that
                    the more time someone spent online recreationally, the less
                    likely they were to be able to tell real news from
                    misinformation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This runs counter to prevailing public attitudes regarding
                    online misinformation spread, say researchers – that older,
                    less digitally-savvy "boomers" are more likely to be taken
                    in by fake news.

                    Up to half of consumers may decide to pour perfectly good
                    milk down the drain based solely on their glance at the date
                    label on the carton, a new study suggests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers using eye-tracking technology found that 50% of
                    study participants declared their intent to throw away milk
                    based on the date stamped on the container – without ever
                    even looking at the label phrasing in front of the date.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each participant saw one of three phrasing options: "Sell
                    by," "Best if used by" or "Use by" a given date, as well as
                    containers with no label at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We asked them if they intended to discard it, and if they
                    said yes, it didn't matter which phrase was there," said
                    senior study author Brian Roe, professor of agricultural,
                    environment and development economics at The Ohio State
                    University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "As soon as we changed the printed date, that was a huge
                    mover of whether or not they would discard or not. So we
                    documented both where their eyes were and what they said was
                    going to happen. And in both cases, it's all about the date,
                    and the phrase is second fiddle."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Policymakers and industry leaders are working toward
                    settling on a universal two-phrase system – one when
                    quality, but not safety, is the concern, and a second phrase
                    for items where safety may be a concern, Roe said. To date,
                    they haven't landed on what those phrases would be.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If you're going to have an education campaign, it helps to
                    have a set of phrases out there that people can cling to –
                    but in the end, so few actually look at the phrase. They
                    look at the date," he said. "The date signifies a point
                    after which you can expect quality to degrade. If you can
                    get firms to push that date further out, then people are
                    going to be willing to use the milk, or whatever it is, for
                    a few more days, and waste a lot less food."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "But we were a bit surprised that over half of the
                    viewing sessions featured no attention on the phrase
                    whatsoever," he said. "The date is more salient – you have
                    to reference it against the calendar. It's more actionable
                    than the phrase is.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For policy reasons, it's still important to narrow the
                    phrases down to two choices. But that's only the beginning –
                    there needs to be a broader conversation about pushing those
                    date horizons back to help minimize food waste."

                    Paleontologists at University College Cork (UCC) have found
                    the first molecular evidence of pheomelanin, the pigment
                    that produces ginger coloration, in the fossil record.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new study reports the preservation of molecular
                    fragments of the pigment pheomelanin in 10-million-year-old
                    frogs, adding molecular analysis to the paleontologists'
                    arsenal when reconstructing the original colors of extinct
                    organisms.

                  <p>
                    [...] Dr. Slater said, "This finding is so exciting because
                    it puts paleontologists in a better place to detect
                    different melanin pigments in many more fossils. This will
                    paint a more accurate picture of ancient animal color and
                    will answer important questions about the evolution of
                    colors in animals. Scientists still don't know how—or
                    why—pheomelanin evolved, because it is toxic to animals, but
                    the fossil record might just unlock the mystery."

                    First, Badbox. Cheap Android streaming boxes, usually
                    costing less than $50, are sold online and in
                    brick-and-mortar shops. These set-top boxes often are
                    unbranded or sold under different names, partly obscuring
                    their source. In the second half of 2022, Human Security
                    says in its report, its researchers spotted an Android app
                    that appeared to be linked to inauthentic traffic and
                    connected to the domain flyermobi.com. When Milisic posted
                    his initial findings about the

                    >, the research also pointed to the flyermobi domain. The
                    team at Human purchased the box and multiple others, and
                    started diving in.

                    [...] The TV devices are built in China. Somewhere before
                    they reach the hands of resellers—researchers don't exactly
                    know where—a firmware backdoor is added to them. This

                    [...] Then there's what Human Security calls Peachpit. This
                    is an app-based fraud element, which has been present on
                    both the TV boxes as well as Android phones and iPhones,
                    Reid says. The company identified 39 Android, iOS, and TV
                    box apps that were involved. "These are template-based
                    applications—not very high quality," says Joao Santos, a
                    security researcher at the company. Apps about developing
                    six-pack abs and logging the amount of water a person drinks
                    were included.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The apps performed a range of fraudulent behavior, including
                    hidden advertisements, spoofed web traffic, and
                    malvertising. The research says that while those behind
                    Peachpit appear different from those behind Badbox, it is
                    likely they are working together in some way. "They have
                    this SDK that did the ad fraud part, and we found a version
                    of this SDK that matches the name of the module that was
                    being dropped on the Badbox," Santos says, referring to a
                    software development kit. "That was another level of
                    connection that we found."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While the attackers have been slowed, the boxes are
                    still in people's homes and on their networks. And unless
                    someone has technical skills, the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/01/preinstalled-malware-infested-t95-tv-box-from-amazon"
                      >malware is very hard to remove</a
                    >. "You can think of these Badboxes as kind of like sleeper
                    cells. They're just sitting there waiting for instruction
                    sets," Reid says. Ultimately, for people buying TV streaming
                    boxes, the advice is to buy branded devices, where the
                    manufacturer is clear and trusted. As Reid says, "Friends
                    don't let friends plug in weird IoT devices into their home
                    networks."

                    The leader of Russia's space corporation, Yuri Borisov,
                    discussed his country's future ambitions in space on Tuesday
                    at the International Astronautical Congress. He spoke
                    expansively about Russia's plans to build a new space
                    station in low-Earth orbit, the Russian Orbital Station, as
                    well as other initiatives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are expecting to design, manufacture, and launch several
                    modules by 2027," Borisov said via a translator at the
                    conference, which is being held in Baku, Azerbaijan, this
                    year. The conference's plenary sessions are being
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FidfZ8iOxw"
                      >livestreamed on YouTube</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This space station will reside in a polar orbit, Borisov
                    added, allowing it to observe the entire planet's surface.
                    Its purpose will be to test new materials, new technologies,
                    and new medicines. “It will be like a permanently
                    functioning laboratory,” he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It all may have looked and sounded good on the
                    international stage, but the presentation had something of
                    the feel of a Potemkin Village, which refers to fake
                    villages designed to impress the Russian empress Catherine
                    the Great two centuries ago. Put another way, most (if not
                    all) of the presentation was based on vaporware rather than
                    hardware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shortly before Borisov took the stage, Russian media sources
                    revealed that the country's budget for space activities is
                    due to drop over the next two years—rather than rise to meet
                    the challenge of these ambitious new space programs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] No one doubts the ability of Russia to build space
                    stations, as the country has a long history of assembling
                    successful orbital outposts. However, since the dissolution
                    of the Soviet Union, Russia has struggled to build new
                    hardware for spaceflight activities. Both its Nauka space
                    station module and Luna 25 spacecraft that recently crashed
                    into the Moon were essentially mothballed projects largely
                    constructed decades ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea that Russia will now build a new space station and
                    launch it within the next four years at a reduced budget is
                    especially difficult to comprehend in the current situation.
                    The country's main focus is on financing and fighting its
                    unprovoked war against Ukraine, and as the space budget
                    story shows, resources for the space program are likely to
                    be reduced rather than increased.

                    SpaceX said last month its Starlink network, with more than
                    4,000 operational satellites, has surpassed 2 million active
                    customers and is available on all seven continents. SpaceX
                    continues to launch satellites, sometimes multiple times per
                    week, to add capacity to the Starlink network. OneWeb, which
                    recently merged with the French satellite company Eutelsat,
                    has more than 600 satellites beaming broadband signals from
                    orbit. The slightly higher altitude of OneWeb's satellites
                    means that its network doesn't require as many spacecraft
                    for global coverage.

                    Amazon's Kuiper constellation will number 3,236 satellites,
                    spread out in 98 orbital planes, or pathways, crisscrossing
                    the planet at an average altitude of about 380 miles (610
                    kilometers). In its license application with the Federal
                    Communications Commission, Amazon said the Kuiper satellites
                    will fly in mid-inclination orbits, enabling Internet
                    service for customers between 56 degrees north and south
                    latitude.

                    originally to be single-user, and they weren't set up to be
                    multi-user," Green told Ars. "The fact that VAX and VMS in

                    The VAX served DEC well throughout the '80s and into the
                    '90s, but as the latter decade went on, DEC began to face
                    stiff competition from UNIX vendors, particularly Sun
                    Microsystems. DEC struggled to change with the times, and
                    the company ultimately failed. In 1998, DEC was acquired by
                    Compaq, and in 2001, Compaq was acquired by Hewlett-Packard.
                    The DEC line, including the VAX/VMS system, was discontinued
                    and faded from the market.

                    Evidence from Gough's Cave already suggests that the eating
                    of the bodies there was of a more ritualistic form. This is
                    because there is ample evidence that the people responsible
                    were hunting and eating lots of other animals, such as deer
                    and horses, while the careful preparation of some of the
                    human remains like the skull cup and an engraved bone show
                    that some was thought was being put into the cannibalism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The fact that we find cannibalism being practiced
                    often on multiple occasions in over a short period of time,
                    in a fairly localized area and solely by individuals
                    attributed to the Magdalenian culture, means we believe this
                    behavior was one that was performed widely by the
                    Magdalenian, and was therefore a funerary behavior in
                    itself," says William.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this context, the eating of the dead can be seen as
                    different in practice, but perhaps not meaning, to
                    cremations, burials or mummification.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Building on this, William and Silvia were then able to look
                    at whether any genetic analysis had been done on the human
                    remains from these sites. This would enable the researchers
                    to see if there were any links between who was practicing
                    which funerary behaviors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Remarkably, the genetic evidence seems to suggest that the
                    two groups practicing different funerary behaviors were
                    genetically distinct populations. All the sites from which
                    evidence of cannibalism has been found show that the people
                    were part of a genetic group known as "GoyetQ2," while all
                    of the more ordinary burials were of people who belonged to
                    the "Villabruna" genetic group.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While both groups were living in Europe at the same time,
                    individuals showing GoyetQ2 ancestry are associated with the
                    region spanning the French-Spanish border, while Villabruna
                    ancestry was carried by individuals who inhabited the
                    Italian-Balkan region. This implies that when the practice
                    of eating the dead ended and more conventional burials
                    became common place in north-western Europe, it wasn't
                    through a spreading of ideas but rather Epigravettian people
                    replacing the Magdalenian.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "At this time, during the terminal period of the
                    Paleolithic, you actually see a turnover in both genetic
                    ancestry and funerary behavior," explains William. "The
                    Magdalenian associated ancestry and funerary behavior is
                    replaced by Epigravettian associated ancestry and funerary
                    behavior, indicative of population replacement as
                    Epigravettian groups migrated into north-western Europe."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Questions still remain about the funerary practices of
                    these ancient humans. For example, William and his
                    colleagues are now trying to can figure out whether these
                    cannibalized humans were related to one another, or whether
                    they were eating people from outside their immediate groups.

                    Humans and primates have brain regions in the temporal lobe
                    that are specialised in perceiving faces and bodies. Dogs
                    also possess a temporal lobe that evolved independently of
                    the primate brain. In recent years, behavioural research has
                    shown that dogs, like humans, are experts in perceiving
                    facial expressions and bodily gestures such as hand signals.
                    "Whether this behavioural expertise is also reflected in the
                    dog brain was the content of our study. Only a few research
                    groups can conduct comparative magnetic resonance imaging
                    studies with dogs," explains first author Magdalena Boch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The study with 40 human participants and 15 pet dogs
                    now provided the first evidence that dogs, like humans, have
                    a brain region in the temporal lobe that is specialised in
                    the visual perception of body postures. In addition, further
                    regions in the dog brain are equally involved in perceiving
                    faces and bodies. In contrast to humans, however, this did
                    not only affect visual brain regions. When dogs look at
                    faces and bodies, there are also differences in activation
                    in areas responsible for processing smells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In humans, the authors additionally identified already known
                    regions specialised exclusively in face perception. "We
                    humans often focus on the face when communicating with
                    others. Our results suggest that faces are also an important
                    source of information for dogs. However, body postures and
                    holistic perception seem to play a superior role," Magdalena
                    Boch explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The specialised brain regions were equally active in dogs
                    when they looked at pictures of conspecifics or humans. This
                    underlines the close bond between dogs and humans, says
                    Ludwig Huber. "Dogs and humans may not be closely related,
                    but they have been close companions for thousands of years.
                    Therefore, comparing dogs and humans also gives us new
                    insights into the so-called convergent evolution of social
                    perception and information processing processes," Claus Lamm
                    concludes.

                    People can be prone to believe in conspiracy theories due to
                    a combination of personality traits and motivations,
                    including relying strongly on their intuition, feeling a
                    sense of antagonism and superiority toward others, and
                    perceiving threats in their environment, according to
                    research published by the American Psychological
                    Association.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Conspiracy theorists are not all likely to be
                    simple-minded, mentally unwell folks—a portrait which is
                    routinely painted in popular culture," said Bowes. "Instead,
                    many turn to conspiracy theories to fulfill deprived
                    motivational needs and make sense of distress and
                    impairment."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers found that overall, people were
                    motivated to believe in conspiracy theories by a need to
                    understand and feel safe in their environment and a need to
                    feel like the community they identify with is superior to
                    others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even though many conspiracy theories seem to provide clarity
                    or a supposed secret truth about confusing events, a need
                    for closure or a sense of control were not the strongest
                    motivators to endorse conspiracy theories. Instead, the
                    researchers found some evidence that people were more likely
                    to believe specific conspiracy theories when they were
                    motivated by social relationships. For instance,
                    participants who perceived social threats were more likely
                    to believe in events-based conspiracy theories, such as the
                    theory that the U.S. government planned the Sept. 11
                    terrorist attacks, rather than an abstract theory that, in
                    general, governments plan to harm their citizens to retain
                    power.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers also found that people with certain
                    personality traits, such as a sense of antagonism toward
                    others and high levels of paranoia, were more prone to
                    believe conspiracy theories. Those who strongly believed in
                    conspiracy theories were also more likely to be insecure,
                    paranoid, emotionally volatile, impulsive, suspicious,
                    withdrawn, manipulative, egocentric and eccentric.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Big Five personality traits (extraversion,
                    agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism)
                    had a much weaker relationship with conspiratorial thinking,
                    though the researchers said that does not mean that general
                    personality traits are irrelevant to a tendency to believe
                    in conspiracy theories.

                      ><strong>no idea</strong></a

                    <em>was</em> the entire Universe. Yes, big, but not crazy
                    big. Others thought that maybe those spirals and smudges we
                    could see were in fact other galaxies altogether, which
                    would mean the Universe is unfathomably large.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the night of October 5-6, 1923 — 100 years ago tonight —
                    Edwin Hubble made an observation that would settle the
                    question once and for all. He took a 45-minute exposure of
                    Andromeda, one of the largest and thus apparently nearest
                    "spiral nebulae", and within it he spotted a single
                    compelling star that we now call Hubble V1. We here on Earth
                    will forever have a very special relationship with that
                    star, because Hubble used its characteristics to show
                    conclusively that Andromeda was not a "spiral nebula" within
                    the Milky Way at all, but rather an entirely separate galaxy
                    which he later estimated to be about 1 million (now
                    understood to be closer to 2.5 million) light-years away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Hubble's time, many other "spiral nebulae"
                    <a href="https://www.astronomy.com/observing/an-ngc-primer/"
                      ><strong>were known</strong></a
                    >
                    that appeared much smaller than Andromeda and were therefore
                    presumably quite a bit farther away. Because of his
                    observation a hundred years ago tonight, Hubble realized
                    that even Andromeda, close enough to be seen with the naked
                    eye, is on the order of 10 quintillion
                    (10,000,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from Earth. And that
                    must mean that the Universe is absurdly, almost comically,
                    huge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Imagine what Edwin Hubble felt like sitting there at Mt.
                    Wilson Observatory, probably by himself late one evening,
                    when he became the first person ever to know that for sure.
                    His use of red ink and an exclamation point in the main
                    figure of this diary illustrates that he knew darn well the
                    significance of what he had found the minute he realized
                    what it was.

                    those pleasant, low-frequency rumblings has been a matter of

                    Purring is mostly exclusive to cats, although certain other

                    have a completely ossified hyoid, although the purring snow
                    leopard is a rare exception.

                    Resin printer company Peopoly created quite a buzz with the
                    unveiling of a
                    <a href="https://peopoly.net/products/magneto-x"
                      >prototype beltless FDM 3D printer, the Magneto X,</a
                    >
                    at the East Coast RepRap Festival. The new printer is a desk
                    top machine with a huge 400 x 300 x 300 mm build volume and
                    print speeds up to 800mm/s. It borrows a design feature seen
                    on CNC machines: magnetic linear motors. Normally, 3D
                    printers move their components with rotating stepper motors
                    attached to gears and pulleys. The linear motor can be
                    thought of as a flat, unrolled motor with the "rotor"
                    attached to the moving component – the tool head – and the
                    stator forming a track along one axis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dubbed the "MagXY" system, the tool head seems to levitate
                    across the gantry without obvious means. It has a top print
                    speed of 800 mm/s with a max acceleration of 22,000 mm/s²,
                    which would make it faster than modern

                    [...] Peopoly is known for high end, large scale, liquid
                    resin 3D printers and the Magneto X will be it's first
                    plastic pushing printer. The printer will likewise be a
                    premium machine with a price tag starting at $1999,
                    currently on sale for $1399 during the pre-order phase. The
                    optional enclosure will cost $79 more. Printers are expected
                    to begin shipping in late November.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Peopoly is leaning hard into the Open Source
                    community. Not only have they become backers of Klipper
                    firmware, they are also using – and supporting – Open Source
                    OcraSlicer. The Magneto X's nozzles are compatible with the
                    popular E3D's V6 volcano which suggests the machine will be
                    open to modification by users. Peopoly also states its
                    machine can be used without joining a cloud-based system and
                    promises customer data will not be collected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 3D printer will have a load cell sensor for precise auto
                    leveling and four independent Z-axis stepper motors for
                    dynamic adjustments. The hotend is rated to 300 degrees
                    Celsius, and with an available enclosure will be able to
                    print engineering grade materials. Prints will be monitored
                    with an included camera which can also take time lapses.

                    Science is a collaborative effort. What we know today would
                    have never been, had it not been generations of scientists
                    reusing and building on the work of their predecessors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, in modern times, academia has become increasingly
                    competitive and indeed rather hostile to the individual
                    researchers. This is especially true for early-career
                    researchers yet to secure tenure and build a name in their
                    fields. Nowadays, scholars are left to compete with each
                    other for citations of their published work, awards and
                    funding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, understandably, many scientists have grown unwilling to
                    cooperate and help their peers by sharing their work. They
                    would "hide" their raw data, despite having taken years-long
                    efforts to collect it. They would also conceal experiments
                    that have failed or proved insignificant. All these
                    practices would then result in different teams wasting
                    precious time in running the same useless studies, rather
                    than making further progress and contributing to the world's
                    knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to their findings, a specific personality
                    trait called "victim sensitivity" predicted knowledge hiding
                    in science. Researchers with this personality trait are
                    characterized by a latent fear of being exploited by others,
                    and thus, are more suspicious about their colleagues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The good news, point out the authors of the study, is
                    that—among the participants—the intention to hide knowledge
                    was rather low.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the authors warn about a potential bias. It is
                    likely that researchers who volunteered to take part in
                    these studies were more cooperative to begin with.
                    Additionally, it might be that in the context of
                    self-reporting, the participants tried to present themselves
                    as more likable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We may need to change the stereotypical way we think about
                    ourselves as researchers, in order to build trust and create
                    a sharing environment among scientists," concludes the
                    research team. "Identifying as a researcher should include
                    being cooperative, other-oriented, and trustworthy: a social
                    identity that stands for knowledge sharing—not knowledge
                    hiding."

                    Despite leading AI companies' attempts to block users from

                    many 4chan users are still turning to these tools to

                    404 Media uncovered one 4chan thread where users recommended
                    various AI tools, including Stable Diffusion and DALL-E, but
                    specifically linked to Bing AI's text-to-image generator
                    (which is powered by DALL-E 3) as a "quick method." After
                    finding the right tool—which could also be a more old-school
                    photo-editing tool like Photoshop—users are instructed to
                    add incendiary captions and share the images on social media
                    to create a blitz of racist images online.<br />[...]<br />Perhaps
                    because Bing AI's tool has seemingly been deemed the
                    quickest method, it has potentially become the most popular
                    tool in the thread. 404 Media concluded that—"judging by the

                    either "Allow YouTube ads" or subscribe to YouTube Premium.

                  <p>

                    promising news for advertisers in terms of extending your

                    ads onto people who have no interest may not yield great
                    results, as they're less likely to convert into customers.

                    on Monday that it will use Samsung's foundry to manufacture
                    its next generation of products, with both partners alluding
                    to potential future RISC-V collaborations.

                    "Samsung Foundry's commitment to advancing semiconductor
                    technology aligns with our vision for advancing RISC-V and

                  <p>
                    Samsung's head of US Foundry business echoed those
                    sentiments: "Samsung's advanced silicon manufacturing nodes
                    will accelerate Tenstorrent's innovations in RISC-V and AI
                    for datacenter and automotive solutions."

                    Tenstorrent hopes to become an alternative to Nvidia for AI
                    hardware. It builds some of its products – such as its 2023
                    standalone ML computer, Black Hole – on RISC-V CPU cores.
                    Sixteen of them, to be exact.

                    it was an official member of the RISC-V Software Ecosystem,
                    which develops code to run on open processor architecture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The current deal for next-gen products, however, has the
                    Korean megalith manufacturing Tenstorrent's Quasar chiplet
                    using Samsung's SF4X process and 4nm architecture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We leave the decision to them where the chips get
                    made," said [Tenstorrent vice president of strategy and
                    corporate communications Bob] Grim. The veep noted that his
                    current customers – LG Electronics and Hyundai – are both in
                    Korea.

                    Samsung is a licensee of Arm processor designs – a rival to
                    RISC-V. Working with Tenstorrent gives Samsung potential
                    exposure to the open processor design that could help it to
                    win more fabrication work from other RISC-V players.

                    terror" and hundreds of bugs being uncovered throughout the
                    codebase. In 2023 new X.Org security vulnerabilities
                    continue to be uncovered, two of which were made public
                    today and date back to X11R2 code from the year 1988.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Made public today was CVE-2023-43785 as an out-of-bounds
                    memory access within the libX11 code that has been around
                    since 1996. A second libX11 flaw is stack exhaustion from
                    infinite recursion within the PutSubImage() function of
                    libX11... This vulnerability has been around since X11R2 in
                    February of 1988.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A third libX11 vulnerability made public today is an integer
                    overflow within XCreateImage() that leads to a heap
                    overflow... That too has been around since X11R2 in 1988.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Two libXpm vulnerabilities were also disclosed today related
                    to out-of-bounds reads and both of those date back to 1998.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due to these issues coming to light, libX11 1.8.7 and libXpm
                    3.5.17 were released today with the necessary security
                    fixes. More details on these latest X.Org security

                    To lead the spin off, Intel tapped 23-year veteran Rivera as

                    following Gelsinger's return to the fab giant in 2021.
                    Rivera is due to make the transition to the standalone PSG
                    biz in January, and will continue to head up Intel's

                  <p>
                    [...] While Intel is still working to fill out PSG's
                    executive suite, Rivera will be joined by Shannon Poulin as
                    chief operating officer. Poulin previously served as VP of

                    within the next two to three years. But much like Softbank's

                    Humans are increasingly settling in areas highly exposed to
                    dangerous flooding, a study warned Wednesday, with China
                    helping drive the rise in risky urban expansion into exposed
                    areas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research, led by a World Bank economist, warns that
                    settlement growth in flood zones has vastly outpaced growth
                    in safe areas since 1985.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In a time when human settlements should be adapting to
                    climate change, many countries are actually rapidly
                    increasing their exposure to floods," author Jun Rentschler
                    told AFP.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study analyzed 30 years of satellite imagery tracking
                    the expansion of human settlement globally, along with flood
                    maps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] East Asia and the Pacific region are among the most
                    exposed, driven particularly by urban expansion in China, as
                    well as Vietnam and Bangladesh.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In Vietnam, where almost one-third of the coastline is now
                    built up, the safest and most productive locations are
                    increasingly occupied," the authors wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Thus, new developments are disproportionately forced onto
                    hazardous land and previously avoided areas, such as
                    riverbeds or floodplains."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The analysis does not incorporate potential increases in
                    flood risks caused by climate change, deforestation or
                    changes to features such as riverbeds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Rentschler said there was little evidence flood zones
                    were expanding at a rate similar to human settlement in
                    known risk areas, suggesting settlement patterns remain the
                    key factor for policymakers to address.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Rentschler argues understanding the settlement trend
                    should be the first step in shifting urbanization policies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is where you want to start: before reducing risks,
                    countries need to stop increasing it," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Local authorities can actually do much more to protect
                    people and prevent future climate change impacts."

                    [...] This collection and sharing of biometric information
                    is what enables the passport-free immigration process –
                    passenger and crew information will need to be disclosed to
                    the airport operator to use for bag management, access
                    control, gate boarding, duty-free purchases, as well as
                    tracing individuals within the airport for security

                  <p>
                    The shared biometrics will serve as a "single token of

                    Members of Singapore's parliament have raised concerns about
                    shifting to universal automated clearance, including data
                    privacy, and managing technical glitches.

                    According to Teo, only Singaporean companies will be allowed
                    ICA-related IT contracts, vendors will be given
                    non-disclosure agreements, and employees of such firms must
                    undergo security screening. Traveler data will be encrypted
                    and transported through data exchange gateways.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for who will protect the data, that role goes to CAG,
                    with ICA auditing its compliance.

                    In case of disruptions that can't be handled by an
                    uninterruptible power supply, off-duty officers will be
                    called in to go back to analog.

                    And even though the ministry is pushing universal coverage,
                    there will be some exceptions, such as those who are unable
                    to provide certain biometrics or are less digitally

                    Set your watches! Scientists have set the clock ticking for
                    the development of a new generation of timepieces with
                    accuracy of up to 1 second in 300 billion years or about 22
                    times the age of the universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers working at European XFEL X-ray have examined the
                    potential of scandium as the basis for nuclear clocks, long
                    seen as the next step forward in accuracy over the current
                    generation of atomic clocks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most atomic clocks rely on oscillators such as caesium,
                    which can oscillate at very reliable frequencies when
                    excited by microwave radiation. For example, the US
                    Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and
                    Technology's NIST-F2 clock would neither gain nor lose one
                    second in about 300 million years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But scientists have held the ambition of going one step
                    further by using the oscillation of the atomic nucleus –
                    rather than the electron shell – to create the next level in
                    timekeeping.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ralf Röhlsberger, researcher at Germany's Deutsches
                    Elektronen-Synchrotron, was part of the team. He said the
                    level of accuracy possible from a nuclear clock using
                    scandium could be equivalent to one second in 300 billion
                    years, according

                    In other words, if your watch loses a second a year, it will
                    be 9,512 years slow by the time a nuclear clock based on
                    scandium is a second out.

                    With every new infection, the pandemic coronavirus gets new
                    chances to mutate and adapt, creating opportunities for the
                    virus to evolve new variants that are better at dodging our
                    immune systems and making us sicker.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Anti-viral drugs, such as Paxlovid and remdesivir, aim to
                    halt this incessant evolution in individual
                    patients—shortening illnesses, snuffing out opportunities
                    for mutation, and reducing transmission. But one antiviral
                    appears to be backfiring—allowing SARS-CoV-2 more
                    opportunities to mutate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06649-6"
                      >a new peer-reviewed study in the journal Nature</a
                    >, the anti-viral drug dubbed molnupiravir is linked to
                    specific SARS-CoV-2 mutation signatures that happened to
                    spring up in 2022 when the drug was introduced.<br />[...]<br />Beyond
                    simply finding molnupiravir-linked mutations, the
                    researchers noted concerning features of them. The
                    researchers found evidence that some of the
                    molnupiravir-linked mutations were under positive
                    selection—that is, they increased in frequency, suggesting
                    that they were advantageous to the virus in some way. They
                    also noted that some viruses with molnupiravir-linked
                    mutations were passed on from person to person in clusters,
                    which suggested onward transmission of these drug-induced
                    mutations.<br />[...]<br />When
                    <a
                      href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-additional-oral-antiviral-treatment-covid-19-certain"
                      >molnupiravir was authorized in the US</a
                    >, there was concern about its potential to cause mutations
                    in people's DNA, rather than the virus. For this reason, it
                    is
                    <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/155055/download"
                      >not recommended for use in pregnant people</a
                    >. But the new data gives birth to more concern about
                    mutations. And this risk is coupled with lackluster efficacy
                    data. In a final data analysis for the Food and Drug
                    Administration, molnupiravir's maker, Merck, combined two
                    sets of trial data to come up with an estimate of just 30
                    percent efficacy at preventing hospitalization and death.<br />[...]<br />FDA
                    advisers summarized the data at the time as "not
                    overwhelmingly good" and "modest at best." They voted in
                    favor of authorizing the drug in a narrow 13 to 10 vote. The
                    drug has never gained a foothold in Europe. Earlier this
                    year, the European Medicines Agency
                    <a
                      href="https://www.merck.com/news/merck-and-ridgeback-provide-update-on-eu-marketing-authorization-application-for-lagevrio-molnupiravir/"

                      molnupiravir</a
                    >. Upon the EMA's rejection, Merck said it was confident of
                    the drug's role in fighting COVID-19 and that it would
                    appeal the decision. In addition to the US, molnupiravir is
                    approved for use in over two dozen countries, including
                    Australia, China, Japan, and the UK, though use of the drug
                    has been scaled back in many places.

                The problem with capturing energy from exhaust heat is that the

                has also sought to cut costs for teams, meaning that adding a
                component like an MGU-H to capture energy while on throttle
                seems unlikely.

                At least in the short term, racing series that have long races
                are likely to use hybrid engines instead of going fully
                electric. If nothing else, this will attract more OEMs to the
                sport. NASCAR currently has only three OEMs, which are Ford,
                Chevrolet, and Toyota. Despite frequent rumors of Dodge
                returning, this has yet to occur, and NASCAR has also failed to
                attract other new OEMs. It is also likely that hybrid engines
                would allow for increased overall power despite the internal
                combustion engine currently being limited to 670 horsepower, and
                more power may well improve the quality of racing on some
                tracks. Switching to hybrid engines is likely to benefit both
                NASCAR teams and fans, and would be a step closer to once again
                racing true stock cars. However, it's much less obvious how to
                go about capturing energy on oval tracks where there is little
                braking, meaning that hybrid engines might not make a meaningful
                impact at a large percentage of NASCAR tracks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Given the cost and technical limitations, how can NASCAR
                actually make hybrid engines work and have a meaningful impact
                on most of their tracks? It might not be practical to boost
                power through hybrid engines on NASCAR's fastest superspeedways,
                where engine power is greatly restricted to keep speeds down and
                improve safety. But how can NASCAR make hybrid engines work for
                the other 30-32 races each year?

                    Reddit said Wednesday that the platform is revamping its
                    privacy settings with an aim to make ad personalization and
                    account visibility toggles consistent. Most notably though,
                    it is removing the ability to opt out of ad personalization
                    based on Reddit activity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company said that it will still have opt-out controls in
                    "select countries" without specifying which ones. It
                    mentioned in a blog post that users won't see more ads but
                    they will see better-targeted ads following this change.

                    "Reddit requires very little personal information, and we
                    like it that way. Our advertisers instead rely on
                    on-platform activity—what communities you join, leave,
                    upvotes, downvotes, and other signals—to get an idea of what

                    [...] The company noted that ad-limiting controls will
                    possibly show you fewer ads from mentioned categories if the
                    toggles are turned off, but won't possibly filter out all
                    ads. Reddit justified this by saying it uses manual tagging
                    and machine learning to label ads, so there is a chance that
                    it is not 100% accurate.

                    is allowed to continue, a situation, he said, that starts
                    with searches on desktop and mobile but extends to the
                    emerging battleground of artificial intelligence.

                    against Google, now into its 14th day. He is the most senior
                    tech executive yet to testify during the trial that focuses
                    on the power of Google as the default search engine on
                    mobile devices and browsers around the globe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] even more worrisome, Nadella argued, is that the
                    enormous amount of search data that is provided to Google
                    through its default agreements can help Google train its AI
                    models to be better than anyone else's — threatening to give
                    Google an unassailable advantage in generative AI that would
                    further entrench its power.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In addition to training its models on search queries,
                    Google has also been moving to secure agreements with
                    content publishers to ensure that it has exclusive access to
                    their material for AI training purposes, according the
                    Microsoft CEO. In Nadella's own meetings with publishers, he
                    said that he now hears that Google "wants ... to write this
                    check and we want you to match it." (Google didn't
                    immediately respond to questions about those deals.)

                  <p>
                    The requests highlight concerns that "what is publicly
                    available today [may not be] publicly available tomorrow"
                    for AI training, according to the testimony.

                    Another problem is the semantic difference that occurs when
                    developers install open source outside of distros and
                    package databases. Modern security scanners all rely on this
                    metadata, so security vulnerabilities go undetected for open
                    source that is installed outside of the distro or package
                    database.

                    [...] We’ve seen great progress the past few years in better
                    establishing the security of open source projects. From the
                    previously mentioned SSDF framework, to Sigstore and SLSA,
                    multiple complementary projects have created developer
                    toolchains for establishing where open source comes from,
                    whether it has been tampered with, and other more reliable
                    trust signals. This range of concerns is frequently referred
                    to as “provenance,” and these open source projects have been
                    aggressively baked into the major programming language
                    registries such as npm, Maven and PyPi, as well as
                    Kubernetes itself supporting software signing with Sigstore.

                    Chainguard, whose founders were cocreators of Sigstore and
                    SLSA. Wolfi strips down the distro to its most essential
                    components and introduces a novel rolling-release cadence so
                    that only updated packages are available for download, and
                    developers no longer need to download open source software
                    outside of the distro.

                  <p>
                    This distro seeks to clear out all the nonessential packages
                    so that when you see a CVE or CVSS score, you know it is a
                    real vulnerability and don’t miss out on false negatives.
                    With less code, fewer bugs, and fewer vulnerabilities, this
                    slim-down of the distro also lets Wolfi give its users more
                    severity-level data CVSS scores, plus support for new
                    versions of open source software packages. On its one-year
                    anniversary, Wolfi supports 1,300 package configurations and
                    has gained the support of scanners from the major container
                    security players such as Docker Scout, Grype, Snyk, Trivy,
                    Wiz, and Prisma Cloud.

                    source code forever,” says Lorenc. “Software doesn’t work
                    like that anymore. You need a plan to constantly update
                    every piece of software because of the rate of
                    vulnerabilities being found. Software expires, and this is
                    no longer a static problem, it’s dynamic.”

                    Today we're announcing Google-Extended, a new control that
                    web publishers can use to manage whether their sites help
                    improve Bard and Vertex AI generative APIs, including future
                    generations of models that power those products. By using
                    Google-Extended to control access to content on a site, a
                    website administrator can choose whether to help these AI
                    models become more accurate and capable over time.

              <p>
                Just like you could previously modify your robots.txt file to
                not be included in Googles webcrawling you are now supposed to
                be able to opt out of being used as language model fodder for
                their AI. So adding those two lines should apparently do the
                trick. No word on if other models will adhere to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                No word on if they will remove content already gathered, don't
                bet on it, or how this will be punished in the future. The
                current claim is that it will not effect ranking in the search
                engine. But that could always change.
              </p>
              <p>
                I like how they phrase it as you "help these AI models" and by
                then opting out of that you are not being helpful or nice. You
                help and they reap all the rewards of your work, that sounds
                like a good deal .. right!?

                    In a time of income inequality and ruthless politics, people
                    with outsized power or an unrelenting willingness to
                    browbeat others often seem to come out ahead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    New research from Dartmouth, however, shows that being
                    uncooperative can help people on the weaker side of a power
                    dynamic achieve a more equal outcome—and even inflict some
                    loss on their abusive counterpart.

                      >in the latest issue of PNAS Nexus</a
                    >, the study takes a fresh look at what are known in game
                    theory as "zero-determinant strategies" developed by
                    renowned scientists William Press, now at the University of
                    Texas at Austin, and the late Freeman Dyson at the Institute
                    for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Zero-determinant strategies dictate that "extortionists"
                    control situations to their advantage by becoming less and
                    less cooperative—though just cooperative enough to keep the
                    other party engaged—and by never being the first to concede
                    when there's a stalemate. Theoretically, they will always
                    outperform their opponent by demanding and receiving a
                    larger share of what's at stake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Unbending players who choose not to be extorted can
                    resist by refusing to fully cooperate. They also give up
                    part of their own payoff, but the extortioner loses even
                    more," says Chen, who is now an assistant professor at the
                    Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our work shows that when an extortioner is faced with an
                    unbending player, their best response is to offer a fair
                    split, thereby guaranteeing an equal payoff for both
                    parties," she says. "In other words, fairness and
                    cooperation can be cultivated and enforced by unbending
                    players."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The empirical evidence to date suggests that people
                    do engage in these extortionate behaviors, especially in
                    asymmetric situations, and that the extorted party often
                    tries to resist it, which is then costly to both parties,"
                    Hilbe says.
