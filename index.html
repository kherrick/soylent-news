                    Archive.org, possibly one of the only entities to preserve
                    the entire history of the Internet, was recently compromised
                    in a hack that revealed data of roughly 31 million users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A little after 2 PM California time, social media blew up
                    with screenshots showing what the archive.org homepage
                    displayed.
                  </p>
                  <p>It read:</p>
                  <blockquote>

                      <p>
                        Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on
                        sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a
                        catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31
                        million of you on HIBP!

                  <p>
                    HIBP is short for Have I been Pwned, the authoritative site
                    for breach notifications that help people protect their
                    accounts after they've been compromised.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The message didn't last long. Soon after it appeared,
                    archive.org, when it loaded at all, displayed a message
                    saying the site was temporarily down. Later, the site
                    returned. Archive.org's Brewster Kahle said on on a social
                    media site that the archive had come under a DDoS attack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, Have I Been Pwnd is reporting that archive.org was
                    hacked. HIBP said the compromise occurred last month and
                    exposed 31 million records containing email addresses,
                    screen names, and bcrypt-hashed passwords.

                    Earlier this month, the Italian energy company Enel X
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/if-you-own-a-juicebox-ev-charger-you-need-to-read-this/"

                    >
                    from the North American market. For its residential
                    customers—owners of the popular Juicebox level 2 home
                    chargers—the physical hardware will continue to work, but
                    from tomorrow Enel X will have ended all software support,
                    including updates and its apps. But Enel X also had
                    commercial clients, and they're even more out of luck—from
                    tomorrow those stations "will lose functionality in the
                    absence of software continuity," Enel X
                    <a href="http://www.juiceboxnorthamerica.com/">says</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Juicebox customers, the loss of Enel X's servers and
                    apps isn't great—they will lose the ability to remotely
                    manage the charger, or schedule charging sessions from it.
                    But most electric vehicles—both battery EVs and plug-in
                    hybrid EVs—have their own built-in software to schedule
                    charging sessions, and to hear some owners tell it, Enel X's
                    software was a poor substitute for the original Juicebox
                    software written by eMotorworks, which was bought by Enel X
                    in 2017.

                    [...] Meanwhile, a number of companies and open source
                    projects are working on offering third-party support for
                    Juiceboxes. Unfortunately, only newer Juiceboxes support the

                    As might be expected, lots of charging solution providers
                    are interested in helping Enel X's stranded commercial
                    customers become their newest happy, smiling customers. But
                    it's going to be up to those stranded by Enel X to find a
                    new company and platform to work with.

                  <p>
                    In some cases that might mean migrating existing hardware
                    over, but
                    <a
                      href="https://sustainablecareers.sae.org/article/juicebox-owners-enel-x/"
                      >as SAE notes</a
                    >, Enel X has done little to make that migration simple. And
                    many businesses may find what were functioning level 2
                    chargers today are just beige-colored bricks tomorrow. For
                    example, with Enel X gone, there are no contracts in place
                    for the SIM cards embedded in each charger that provide the
                    connectivity those devices expect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When that goes dead, the only way you can really get those
                    chargers going again is you physically send someone out
                    there, or you ask the person on the property to take out the
                    SIM card, replace it," said Joseph Schottland, CEO of EV+
                    Charging. "It's a big ask, because they've got to get the
                    screwdriver out, take the back of the charger off... They've
                    got to know where to look."

                    Jason Allen—a synthetic media artist whose
                    Midjourney-generated work "Théâtre D'opéra Spatial" went
                    viral and incited backlash after winning a state fair art
                    competition—is not giving up his fight with the US Copyright
                    Office.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last fall, the Copyright Office refused to register Allen's
                    work, claiming that almost the entire work was AI-generated
                    and insisting that copyright registration requires more
                    human authorship than simply plugging a prompt into
                    Midjourney.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Allen is now appealing that decision, asking for judicial
                    review and alleging that "the negative media attention
                    surrounding the Work may have influenced the Copyright
                    Office Examiner's perception and judgment." He claims that
                    the Examiner was biased and considered "improper factors"
                    such as the public backlash when concluding that he had "no
                    control over how the artificial intelligence tool analyzed,
                    interpreted, or responded to these prompts."

                A working Turing Machine was submitted to Lego Ideas, consisting
                of approximately 2,900 parts and a bucketload of extreme
                cleverness. The Lego builder first came across the concept a few
                years ago and, despite it being an abstract model, decided to
                attempt making one out of the plastic components of Lego
                Technic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Talking to <i>El Reg</i>, the submitter "The Bananaman" stated:
                "My first few ideas [on] how to do this would be very big and
                inefficient if they were ever [to be] built, but I usually
                stopped developing them very early. The first one that could
                possibly work was three years ago and I built a part of the tape
                with the symbol reader and a very bad unfinished prototype of
                the 'truth table' that would use a 32-speed gearbox instead of
                the 'searching' mechanism. Later I realized that the 'truth
                table' can be made way more easily (it was my fourth idea on how
                to build the table and it still had a dozen revisions later on),
                and I came up with using the registers which made everything
                easier. I started building the prototype last vacation, then
                took a break and I've finished it this vacation."
              </p>
              <p>
                There was also the challenge of fitting into the limits imposed
                by Lego Ideas. At the time of submission, this was 3,000 parts,
                and The Bananaman's contraption finally managed to come in at
                around 2,900. The limit has since been raised to 5,000 parts.
                Should it get to 10,000 supporters on the Lego Ideas site, it
                will go into Expert Review, where Lego's professionals will
                decide if it should be approved for production. The evaluation
                will depend on a range of criteria, including feasibility and
                strength of idea.

                    Governor Gavin Newsom over the weekend signed into law a
                    bill amending the California Consumer Privacy Act, the
                    state's spin on the GDPR in Europe, to classify "neural
                    data" as protected personal information along the lines of
                    precise geolocation, genetics and biometrics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Neurorights Foundation medical director Sean Pauzauskie
                    called the Califoria law "an enormous victory" for patients
                    suffering from mental health disorders as well as for
                    consumers simply looking to enhance their lives with new
                    technologies.
                  </p>
                  <p>The NGO co-sponsored the bill with a state senator.</p>
                  <p>
                    "The essential privacy guardrails it ensures should only
                    boost confidence in all varieties of these revolutionary
                    neurotechnologies, the great majority which are based in
                    California," Pauzauskie said in a release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    California is the second state to extend data protections to
                    brainwaves, on the heels of Colorado putting in place a law
                    requiring privacy safeguards along the lines of what is done
                    for fingerprints.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The California law sends "a clear signal to the fast-growing
                    neurotechnology industry" to protect people's mental
                    privacy, NeuroRights Foundation general counsel Jared Genser
                    said in a release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Protections under the California law include the right to
                    know what brain data is being collected, limit its
                    disclosure, and to be able to opt-out or have it deleted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The law applies to devices capable of recording or altering
                    nervous system activity, whether they be implanted or worn,
                    the NGO said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The potential for devices to tap into how people feel or
                    think has raised concerns they could be used to manipulate
                    feelings or thoughts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In the coming years, the sensitivity of neural data will
                    increase alongside surging investments...resulting in
                    increased resolution of brain scans and larger datasets of
                    brain data being collected," the NGO predicted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Meanwhile generative artificial intelligence will continue
                    accelerating the ability to accurately decode these scans."

                    TV and streaming stick manufacturers and streaming service
                    providers, have developed a "surveillance system" that has

                    to a report from the Center for Digital Democracy (CDD)
                    published today and sent to the Federal Trade Commission
                    (FTC). Unprecedented tracking techniques aimed at pleasing
                    advertisers have resulted in connected TVs (CTVs) being a
                    "privacy nightmare," according to Jeffrey Chester, report

                    user rights under the E.U.'s GDPR," the advocacy group said.
                    "In reality, this tracking option doesn't replace cookies

                    Getting into arguments with strangers online or family
                    members at the dinner table can feel a bit like debating
                    with a brick wall. We are probably all guilty of feeling
                    like we are right, even if we don't have all the facts.
                    According to a recent psychology study, people tend to
                    assume that they have all of the information that they need
                    to make a decision or support their position–even if they
                    don't. This phenomenon dubbed the "illusion of information
                    adequacy" is detailed in a study published October 9 in the
                    journal PLoS ONE.

                    "Interpersonal conflict is on the rise, driving increases in
                    anger, anxiety, and general stress," Angus Fletcher, a study
                    co-author and narrative theorist and neurophysiologist at
                    the Ohio State University, tells Popular Science. "We wanted
                    to look into those misunderstandings and see if they could
                    be mitigated."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team calls this belief that we are correct–even when we
                    don't have all of the information–<b

                  <p>
                    Fletcher describes the illusion of adequacy as, "The less
                    that our brain knows, the more confident it is that it knows
                    all it needs to know. This makes us prone to thinking that
                    we have all the crucial facts about a decision, leaping to
                    confident conclusions and decisive judgments, when we are
                    missing necessary information."

                    Before you can write an exploit, you need a bug. When there
                    are no bugs, we have to get creative—that's where Fault
                    Injection comes in. Fault injection can take many forms,
                    including software-controlled data corruption, power
                    glitching, clock glitching, electromagnetic pulses, lasers,
                    and more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hardware fault injection is something that typically
                    requires specialized (and expensive) equipment. The costs
                    stem from requiring a high degree of precision in terms of
                    both when and where the fault is injected. There are many
                    valiant attempts at bringing down the costs, with notable
                    projects ranging from the RP2040-based PicoEMP, all the way
                    to "Laser Fault Injection for The Masses". (The RP2040 crops
                    up a lot due to its low cost combined with the "PIO"
                    peripheral, which can do I/O with tight timings and latency)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A while back I read about using a piezo-electric BBQ Igniter
                    coupled to an inductor as a low-budget tool for
                    electro-magnetic fault injection (EMFI), and I was
                    captivated. I wondered, how far can you take such a
                    primitive tool? At the time, the best thing I could come up
                    with was exploiting a software implementation of AES running
                    on an Arduino, using DFA—it worked!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But I wasn't fully satisfied. I wanted to exploit something
                    more "real," but I was out of ideas for the time being....

                adding them. By adding more commercials and shoppable ads,
                Amazon is trying to see how much ads people will tolerate while
                watching their favorite shows.

                    As for the conversion, it looks fairly well-executed, though
                    it does make the Cayenne look somewhat like a sea mammal
                    with wheels. It's weird, but we don't hate it. It's unclear
                    how long it took West Coast Customs to do the conversion or
                    how much it cost, though we assume the answer is "a long
                    time" and "expensive."

                It's bad enough that Porsche took a turn to the ordinary when
                they started making SUVs, as a cash grab to suppliment their
                traditional expertise in sports and racing cars. But a minivan
                is a step too far...

                    Starting a new car company isn't easy—just ask Henrik
                    Fisker, whose second bite at that particular cherry ended
                    the same way as his first when it filed for bankruptcy this
                    July. At the time, Fisker said it wanted to try to "preserve
                    certain customer programs," but Ars wondered what this
                    actually meant, particularly now that electric vehicles are
                    so dependent on software support and cloud connectivity.
                    Now, thanks to a recent court filing spotted by TechCrunch,
                    we know the answer: nothing good.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Car publications were already warning consumers to steer
                    clear of the Ocean as early as this March, despite massive
                    price cuts that saw these electric SUVs being offered for
                    less than $25,000. A New York-based company called American
                    Lease was less deterred by this warning and in June agreed
                    to purchase the remaining Fisker inventory—approximately
                    3,300 cars for a total of $46.3 million dollars. By October,
                    American Lease had paid Fisker $42.5 million and had taken
                    delivery of about 1,100 Oceans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That was the plan until the end of last week, at least. Last
                    Friday evening, Fisker informed American Lease that the
                    Oceans "cannot, as a technical matter, be 'ported' from the
                    Fisker server to which the vehicles are currently linked to
                    a distinct server owned and/or controlled by" American
                    Lease.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] American Lease says it "cannot overstate the
                    significance of this unwelcome news," particularly since it
                    had already paid Fisker the vast majority of the agreed
                    price. American Lease is also more than a little unhappy
                    that the news was delivered a few days before a court
                    hearing scheduled for today and says it's unclear how long
                    Fisker has known that its cars cannot be ported to a new
                    server.

                        John Hopfield invented a network that uses a method for
                        saving and recreating patterns. We can imagine the nodes
                        as pixels. The Hopfield network utilises physics that
                        describes a material's characteristics due to its atomic
                        spin – a property that makes each atom a tiny magnet.
                        The network as a whole is described in a manner
                        equivalent to the energy in the spin system found in
                        physics, and is trained by finding values for the
                        connections between the nodes so that the saved images
                        have low energy. When the Hopfield network is fed a
                        distorted or incomplete image, it methodically works
                        through the nodes and updates their values so the
                        network's energy falls. The network thus works stepwise
                        to find the saved image that is most like the imperfect
                        one it was fed with.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Geoffrey Hinton used the Hopfield network as the
                        foundation for a new network that uses a different
                        method: the Boltzmann machine. This can learn to
                        recognise characteristic elements in a given type of
                        data. Hinton used tools from statistical physics, the
                        science of systems built from many similar components.
                        The machine is trained by feeding it examples that are
                        very likely to arise when the machine is run. The
                        Boltzmann machine can be used to classify images or
                        create new examples of the type of pattern on which it
                        was trained. Hinton has built upon this work, helping
                        initiate the current explosive development of machine
                        learning.

                    Months ago, 13-year-old Willis "Blue Scuti" Gibson

                      >became the first person to "beat" NES Tetris</a
                    >, crashing the game after a 1,511-line, 157-level
                    performance. Over the weekend, 16-year-old Michael
                    "dogplayingtetris" Artiaga became the first to reach an even
                    more impressive plateau in the game,
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXhbti5SneE"
                      >looping past Level 255</a
                    >
                    and instantly rolling the game all the way back to the
                    ultra-slow Level 0.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It took Artiaga a bit over 80 minutes and a full 3,300
                    cleared lines to finally achieve the game's first
                    near-mythical "rebirth"
                    <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2268738212"
                      >live in front of hundreds of Twitch viewers</a
                    >.<br />[...]<br />Artiaga's record does come with a small
                    asterisk since he used a version of the game that was
                    modified to avoid the crashes that stopped Blue Scuti's
                    historic run.<br />[...]<br />NES Tetris was never designed
                    for play past Level 29, though, which means unintended
                    glitches start to get in the way of any truly endless Tetris
                    sessions. At Level 138,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Lp2yA2wYKI&amp;t=0s"
                      >a memory overflow error</a
                    >
                    causes the Tetris pieces to show up in some increasingly
                    funky colors, including palettes that are incredibly hard to
                    make out at Levels 146 and 148.<br />[...]<br />Even with a
                    modified game, though, Artiaga faced another massive
                    mountain of a glitch before he could achieve rebirth: Level
                    235. While the Tetris Level counter usually cycles every 10
                    lines,
                    <a
                      href="https://cohost.org/rgmechex/post/5264863-rgme-article-33-81"
                      >vagaries of the game's binary-coded decimal line
                      counter</a
                    >
                    cause the level count to get stuck on 235 for a whopping 810
                    lines. To make matters worse, the Level 235 glitched color
                    palette is a dull green that is hard to see against the
                    game's black background, making the level a true test of
                    endurance.<br />[...]<br />Artiaga—who started playing
                    high-level Tetris competitively at the age of 10 in 2019—has
                    won the Classic Tetris World Championship two times, in
                    addition to setting multiple records in the game and
                    dominating many smaller tournaments. Despite all that, he
                    said during his stream that "this is the best thing I've
                    ever done in Tetris, bro."<br />[...]<br />"Oh my god, I'm
                    so glad that game is over, bro," Artiaga said on stream. "I
                    never want to play this game again, bro... I was starting to
                    lose my mind."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now that the Tetris rebirth has been proven humanly possible
                    (with crash-avoidance mods, at least), the community will no
                    doubt move on to see who, if anyone, can complete a double
                    rebirth in a single uninterrupted Tetris session.<br />[...]<br />One
                    thing's for sure: The classic Tetris scene has certainly
                    come a long way since the days of the Level 29 "kill
                    screen."

                    Concern about deceptively edited photos feels like a very
                    modern anxiety, yet a century ago similar worries were being
                    litigated...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Portrait photography gave rise to an industry of photo
                    'retouching' – analog 'beauty filters' – to flatter subjects
                    in a way portrait painters once did. This trend lead to
                    questions about technology distorting our perceptions of
                    beauty, reality and truth:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other commercial applications of photo retouching emerged:
                    in 1911 tourists visiting Washington D.C. could acquire fake
                    photographs of themselves posing with then President of the
                    United States William Taft. This troubled Government
                    officials. Upon discovering the practice in 1911, a United
                    States Attorney ordered it stopped.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The following year a fugitive - wanted for people
                    trafficking - was found in possession of a fake photo posing
                    with President Taft, it was reported he'd used it to buy the
                    trust of his victims:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That this seemingly benign practice had been weaponized
                    prompted some to demand it be regulated against abuse. The
                    justice department prepared a law, that was introduced by
                    then Senator Henry Cabot Lodge - who'd similarly been
                    troubled after reportedly finding a photograph of himself
                    with someone he'd never met.

                    NERD HARDER! has been the answer ever since CALEA – and
                    related Clinton-era initiatives, like the failed Clipper
                    Chip program, which would have put a spy chip in every

                    America may have invented NERD HARDER! but plenty of other
                    countries have taken up the cause. The all-time champion is
                    former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who, when
                    informed that the laws of mathematics dictate that it is
                    impossible to make an encryption scheme that only protects
                    good secrets and not bad ones, replied, "The laws of
                    mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that
                    applies in Australia is the law of Australia":

                    CALEA forced a redesign of the foundational, physical layer
                    of the internet. Thankfully, encryption at the protocol
                    layer – in the programs we use – partially counters this
                    deliberately introduced brittleness in the security of all
                    our communications. CALEA can be used to intercept your
                    communications, but mostly what an attacker gets is
                    "metadata" ("so-and-so sent a message of X bytes to such and
                    such") because the data is scrambled and they can't
                    unscramble it, because cryptography actually <em>works</em>,
                    unlike back doors. Of course, that's why governments in the
                    EU, the US, the UK and all over the world are
                    <em>still</em> trying to ban working encryption, insisting
                    that the back doors they'll install will only let the good
                    guys in:

                    The Chinese sponsored hacking group know as Salt Typhoon
                    intercepted the communications of hundreds of millions of
                    American residents, businesses, and institutions. From that
                    position, they could do NSA-style metadata-analysis, malware
                    injection, and interception of unencrypted traffic. And they
                    <em>didn't have to hack anything</em>, because the US
                    government insists that all networking gear ship
                    <em>pre-hacked</em> so that cops can get into it.

                    This isn't even the first time that CALEA back doors have
                    been exploited by a hostile foreign power as a matter of
                    geopolitical skullduggery. In 2004-2005, Greece's
                    telecommunications were under mass surveillance by US spy
                    agencies who wiretapped Greek officials, all the way up to
                    the Prime Minister, in order to mess with the Greek Olympic
                    bid:

                    This is a wild story in <em>so many</em> ways. For one
                    thing, CALEA isn't law in Greece! You can totally sell
                    working, secure networking gear in Greece, and in many other
                    countries around the world where they have not passed a
                    stupid CALEA-style law. <em>However</em> the US telecoms
                    market is so fucking <em>huge</em> that all the
                    manufacturers build CALEA back doors into their gear, no
                    matter where it's destined for. So the US has effectively
                    exported this deliberate insecurity to the whole planet –
                    and used it to screw around with <em>Olympic bids</em>, the
                    most penny-ante bullshit imaginable.

                  <p>
                    Now Chinese-sponsored hackers with cool names like "Salt
                    Typhoon" are traipsing around inside US telecoms
                    infrastructure, using the back doors the FBI insisted would
                    be safe.

                    evaluated the remains of the aircraft for clues to the cause
                    of the tragedy. Then came the task of cleaning the site and
                    leaving no pieces of the highly classified aircraft for
                    scavengers, the media, or others to find. A clean-up team
                    moved out a thousand feet from the last of the recognizable
                    debris and then dug and sifted all the dirt in the area.

                    'On Jul. 23, controlled explosive charges were detonated on

                    Then, according to Knowledge Stew, the Air Force brought in
                    a crashed F-101A Voodoo, an aircraft that had been out of
                    service with the Air Force since 1972 and with the Air
                    National Guard since 1982. The crashed Voodoo had been in
                    storage at the secretive Area 51 in Nevada for more than 20
                    years, and it was broken up and put in place of the F-117
                    debris. Almost a month later, the Air Force said the area
                    was no longer restricted.

                  <p>
                    The move will come as a blow for any organizations that have
                    built IoT deployments using LoRaWAN that may have considered
                    Cisco to be a safe and dependable supplier. The networking

                  <p>
                    LoRaWAN is a low power, wide area network specification,
                    specifically designed to connect devices such as sensors
                    over relatively long distances. It is built on LoRa, a form
                    of wireless communication that uses spread spectrum
                    modulation, and makes use of license-free sub-gigahertz
                    industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio bands. The
                    tech is overseen by the
                    <a href="https://lora-alliance.org/">LoRa Alliance</a>.

                  <p>
                    [...] One analyst we spoke to who covers the IoT space said
                    this likely isn't a profitable part of the business as far
                    as Cisco is concerned. Since LoRa has a long range, fewer
                    gateways are required than in Wi-Fi deployments, for
                    example, and there are many vendors making LoRa sensors and
                    hardware, resulting in a competitive market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Exiting the LoRaWAN market is probably part of a more
                    focused look at networking, paring away areas where they
                    either weren't dominant, they don't see growth potential or
                    that isn't in line with their overall networking roadmap."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Any Cisco LoRaWAN customers can perhaps take comfort from
                    the fact that the final date to receive applicable service
                    and support as stipulated in active service contracts is
                    December 31, 2029. However, the last date that Cisco
                    Engineering may release a planned maintenance release or
                    software patch is much nearer – December 31, 2026.

                    It's worth noting that while nuclear may be hot right now,
                    it's far from the only option datacenter operators can
                    consider – even it if is one of the cleaner alternatives.

                This watch was issued for a coronal mass ejection (CME) that
                occurred around 03 UTC on October 9 and is expected to reach
                Earth around 12-15 UTC on October 10. An

                states that the speed of the CME, around 2.5 million miles per
                hour, is the fastest that a CME has been ejected toward Earth
                during the current solar cycle. From my very limited

                least up to X28. The high speed of the CME, however, seems to be
                a factor in the potential for a severe geomagnetic storm.

                One of the main questions that we can't answer until the CME
                gets to within about a million miles of Earth is the orientation
                of its magnetic field.

                concerned about the possibility of viewing auroras or potential
                disruptions to the power grid, so hopefully some of the comments
                can explain a bit more about what it means. I don't know a whole
                lot about space weather, but I'll try to offer a cursory
                explanation of what I believe some of it means.

                occur. A CME will appear like an explosion outward from the
                sun's corona. The data is input into a model called
                <a

                the sun) of solar wind plasma. A higher plasma density or a
                faster radial velocity should result in a stronger geomagnetic
                storm. This is also useful for estimating when a CME will reach
                Earth. I believe the

                is used to measure how much the Earth's magnetic field is
                compressed or stretched and can identify the onset of
                geomagnetic storms. The

                data are satellite-derived measurements of the solar wind. In
                addition to showing the plasma speed, temperature, and density,
                the Bz and Phi variables show the orientation of the magnetic
                field in the solar wind. If Bz is positive, it's a
                northward-oriented magnetic field. However, a negative Bz
                indicates a southward-oriented magnetic field, the opposite
                direction of Earth's magnetic field, and this can result in more
                severe geomagnetic storms. Basically, a strongly negative Bz
                around -10 or even -20 would be more favorable for a strong
                geomagnetic storm. The aurora forecast is a short-term forecast
                (~30 minutes to an hour) of the probability of auroral activity
                over a location, though auroras may be visible near the horizon
                in areas equatorward of what the forecast shows.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's a lot of data on NOAA's space weather dashboard that can
                be useful for anyone hoping to see the auroras. My understanding
                of space weather is very limited, so if anyone else has a better
                understanding of what the data means, please share the
                information in the comments. Although a G4 or even a G5
                geomagnetic storm is possible, but there's still a lot of
                uncertainty until the CME gets very close to Earth.

                    [...] Although only a simulation, the outcome of the
                    experiment suggests that using a nuclear X-ray pulse on an
                    asteroid could potentially change its trajectory enough to
                    prevent a collision with the Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I knew right away that this was a huge success," said
                    Moore.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is a significant difference between planting a nuclear
                    bomb on an asteroid and directing a nuclear X-ray pulse to
                    part of an asteroid to nudge it onto a different trajectory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If a space agency were to successfully detonate a nuclear
                    bomb on an asteroid, scientists have cautioned that the
                    asteroid would be likely to break into smaller chunks,
                    potentially causing multiple asteroid impacts on Earth
                    instead of just one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even if the trajectory of the biggest chunk of the asteroid
                    was changed, there would be no guarantee that the other
                    fragments of the asteroid would travel away from Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using an X-ray pulse, scientists can generate energy to
                    vapourise enough material from the surface of the asteroid
                    to result in a push that would change the trajectory of the
                    asteroid rather than blasting it into smaller fragments.

                    price hike of a life-saving anti-parasitic drug has ended
                    with a flat denial from the highest court in the land.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Monday, the Supreme Court rejected Shkreli's petition to
                    appeal an order to return $64.6 million in profits from the
                    pricing scheme of Daraprim, a decades-old drug used to treat
                    toxoplasmosis. The condition is caused by a single-celled
                    parasite that can be deadly for newborns and people with
                    compromised immune systems, such as people who have HIV,
                    cancer, or an organ transplant.<br />[...]<br />In a lawsuit
                    filed in 2021, the Federal Trade Commission and seven state
                    attorneys general accused Shkreli of building a "web of
                    anticompetitive restrictions to box out the competition." In
                    January of 2022, US District Court Judge Denise Cote agreed,
                    finding that Shkreli's conduct was "<a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cotes banned Shkreli from the pharmaceutical industry for
                    life and found him liable for $64.6 million in disgorgement.

                    with the Supreme Court arguing that the ill-gotten profits
                    from Daraprim's price hike went to corporate entities, not
                    Shkreli personally, and that federal courts had issued
                    conflicting rulings on disgorgement liabilities.

                    compiled by Jon Peddie Research (JPR) reveals a significant
                    surge in global AIB [add-in board] volumes, up 47.9 percent
                    year-on-year to 9.5 million units and up 9.4 percent
                    quarter-over-quarter from 8.7 million.

                  <p>
                    Yet since Intel introduced its first dedicated AIB – or
                    graphics card – via the
                    <a

                    >
                    microarchitecture in March 2022, the company has seemingly
                    failed to capture meaningful market share from either Nvidia
                    or AMD, at least according to JPR.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When Intel first teased its Arc GPUs, there was a lot
                    of buzz. Could Chipzilla translate its experience in
                    processors to AIBs and perform as well in the dedicated
                    graphics market as it has elsewhere?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On launch, the company talked a big game about disrupting
                    the duopoly of Nvidia and AMD. Intel promised its products
                    would be affordable and competitive, with options for
                    gamers, creators, and enterprise users. Just over two years
                    in, the reality hasn't lived up to the hype. Intel has
                    suffered some technical setbacks, including driver
                    instability and immaturity, which is a given for a new
                    player in the market. The other stumbling block is
                    performance related, although Intel has consistently
                    released new driver updates looking to address this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From here, Intel's movement into the AIB market seems to
                    have been a dud, particularly considering the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/23/intel_apollo_investment/"

                    >
                    and

                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/27/arm_intel_takeover/"
                      >rivals expressing interest in acquiring assets</a
                    >. If Intel can't even dent a full percentile of AMD's
                    market share, it seemingly doesn't stand a chance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unless Intel can recapture some of that earlier buzz with
                    the upcoming Battlemage AIBs between now and the end of
                    2025, its goal of being a major player in dedicated graphics
                    appears more likely to be a pipe dream.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Intel needs to focus on its pedigree in microprocessors
                    rather than trying to enter a market locked down by Nvidia
                    because the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/26/intel_0x12b_raptor_lake/"

                    >
                    haven't done its reputation any favors. Nvidia's dominance
                    in the broader graphics market looks unlikely to change as
                    we enter the age of AI, nor will its chokehold on the AIB
                    industry, at least not any time soon.

                    Will enough people and groups support Berners-Lee's vision
                    to make it viable? Or has the pendulum swung so much towards
                    the corporate web that his vision will remain an unfulfilled

                    These electrons produce more electrons, and so on. When
                    electrons in this avalanche collide with air molecules,
                    gamma rays result. But although this process is well
                    understood, scientists don’t understand the details behind
                    the different types of gamma-ray outbursts, or how they are
                    related.

                    The newfound flickering gamma-ray flashes could be a missing
                    link between terrestrial gamma-ray flashes and gamma-ray
                    glows, as their brightness and duration fell in between
                    those of the other two classes. Like high-energy strobe
                    lights, these outbursts consisted of <a

                  <p>
                    In addition, many of the flickering gamma-ray flashes were
                    followed by a type of outburst called a narrow bipolar
                    event, which was then followed by lightning. This could mean
                    that the flickering gamma-ray flashes help initiate
                    lightning, <a

                    Gamma rays might also be involved in limiting how strong
                    electric fields can get in thunderclouds, says coauthor
                    Steven Cummer, an electrical engineer at Duke University.
                    That means that “this whole gamma ray–generating process
                    that was interesting and uncommon before, now actually
                    appears to be quite central in all of atmospheric
                    electricity.”

                    This time, the argali material looked good, so Schubarth
                    signed a "cell storage agreement" with an unnamed cloning
                    firm in January 2013 and shipped the somatic cells off to
                    storage. It took until 2015, perhaps for financial reasons,
                    before Schubarth signed an "Ovine Cloning Contract" with the
                    same firm, which required a $4,200 deposit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2016, Schubarth received 165 cloned argali embryos at his
                    Montana ranch, and in 2017, the first pure Marco Polo argali
                    sheep was born to him. Schubarth named it "Montana Mountain
                    King."<br />[...]<br />came to the attention of the feds,
                    who charged Schubarth in early 2024 with animal trafficking
                    and conspiracy. He pled guilty and "exhibited remorse and
                    has been compliant" ever since, said the government. He
                    allowed officials onto his ranch to do genetic testing and
                    to quarantine or remove animals as necessary, and
                    Schubarth's beloved Montana Mountain King was confiscated.
                    The government did end up killing some of the animals on the
                    ranch, though it notes that "the meat from those animals has
                    been donated to Montana families in need."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yesterday, Schubarth was sentenced to six months in prison
                    along with a $20,000 fine and a $4,000 payment to the
                    National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.

                    Microsoft's senior director of IT, Keith Boyd, says remote
                    work can be

                    as long as it's done right.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If you make the time to do it right, your employees will be
                    more engaged, more productive, and more connected, even when
                    they're miles away," Boyd wrote in an August blog post. "And
                    they'll be far less likely to leave for a competitor who has
                    a more sophisticated and flexible model than you do."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The remote model has advantages from both the employee's and
                    employer's perspectives. For example, a company that covers
                    daycare costs can save money with a remote work program,
                    while the employee can reap the benefits of not having to
                    commute daily.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunately, the risks and disadvantages of remote
                    employees primarily lie on the company's shoulders. Loss of
                    productivity due to workers taking care of personal business
                    or even napping is a genuine concern. It's not surprising to
                    learn that there are actual products that
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techspot.com/news/103403-wells-fargo-fired-dozen-employees-simulating-keyboard-activity.html"
                      >circumvent</a
                    >
                    monitoring measures employers frequently use to be sure
                    their employees are working while on the clock.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, there are not many disadvantages for the remote
                    employee, which is probably the most contributing factor to
                    workers fighting tooth and nail to stay out of the office.
                    Protests and unionizing efforts are more prevalent
                    post-pandemic, and much of the bellyaching relates to
                    employers reversing stay-at-home mandates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That said, Microsoft thinks it has the remote work dynamic
                    figured out. We'll have to see if its reassurances about
                    continuing with the model help keep its workers in line
                    without direct supervision.

                    Europol, the law enforcement agency of the European Union,
                    writes that it supported a new series of actions against
                    LockBit members, leading to the four arrests and seizures of
                    servers critical for the group's infrastructure.

                  <p>
                    Ransomware criminals in Russia are often safe from arrest as
                    the local authorities tend to ignore their actions as long
                    as they don't attack organizations within the country. But
                    one of those arrested, a LockBit developer, had gone on
                    vacation in August to a territory that has an extradition
                    agreement with France. The French Gendarmerie were alerted,
                    leading to his arrest. The individual and the country where
                    he was apprehended have not been revealed.

                  <p>
                    August also saw two more people arrested in connection to
                    the operation, both in the UK. One is reported to be
                    associated with a LockBit affiliate, and the other is
                    suspected of money laundering. Britain's National Crime
                    Agency identified them using data seized during the

                  <p>
                    The final arrest was made at Madrid airport, where Spain's
                    Guardia Civil arrested an administrator of a Bulletproof
                    hosting service used by the ransomware group. Bulletproof
                    hosting companies provide hosting services that are
                    deliberately designed to be resistant or immune to takedown
                    requests, law enforcement, or other forms of interference.
                    They are often linked to criminal activities because they
                    allow or tolerate hosting illegal content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Spanish officers also seized nine servers, part of the
                    ransomware's infrastructure.

                  <p>
                    In addition, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United
                    States implemented sanctions against an actor identified as
                    a prolific affiliate of LockBit and strongly linked to
                    ransomware group Evil Corp.

                  <p>
                    16 members of Evil Corp, once believed to be the most
                    significant cybercrime threat in the world have been
                    sanctioned in the UK with their links to the Russian state
                    and other ransomware groups, including LockBit, exposed.
                    Sanctions have also been imposed by Australia and the US

                  <p>
                    The LockBit ransomware-as-a-service has been behind over
                    1,700 attacks on organizations in the United States from
                    virtually every sector, from government and financial to
                    transport, healthcare, and education.

                    Investigators also seized 34 servers containing over 2,500
                    decryption keys and used the data gathered from those

                        Imagine if your boss called a meeting in May to announce
                        that he's committing 10 percent of the company's revenue
                        to the development of a brand-new mass-market consumer
                        product, made with a not-yet-ready-for-mass-production
                        component. Oh, and he wants it on store shelves in less
                        than six months, in time for the holiday shopping
                        season. Ambitious, yes. Kind of nuts, also yes.

                        But that's pretty much what Pat Haggerty, vice president
                        of Texas Instruments, did in 1954. The result was the
                        Regency TR-1, the world's first commercial transistor
                        radio, which debuted 70 years ago this month. The
                        engineers delivered on Haggerty's audacious goal, and I
                        certainly hope they received a substantial year-end
                        bonus.

                      <p>
                        [...] TI was still a small company, with not much in the
                        way of R&amp;D capacity. But Haggerty and the other
                        founders wanted it to become a big and profitable
                        company. And so they established research labs to focus
                        on semiconductor materials and a project-engineering
                        group to develop marketable products.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Haggerty made a good investment when he hired Gordon
                        Teal, a 22-year veteran of Bell Labs. Although Teal
                        wasn't part of the team that invented the germanium
                        transistor, he recognized that it could be improved by
                        using a single grown crystal, such as silicon. Haggerty
                        was familiar with Teal's work from a 1951 Bell Labs
                        symposium on transistor technology. Teal happened to be
                        homesick for his native Texas, so when TI advertised for
                        a research director in the New York Times, he applied,
                        and Haggerty offered him the job of assistant vice
                        president instead. Teal started at TI on 1 January 1953.

                Between February 14 and February 26, 2024, FBCS [Financial
                Business and Consumer Solutions] experienced a cyberattack where
                someone unauthorized got into their computer network and took
                some data. Comcast told customers about this in a letter, saying
                that customer information might have been taken during this
                time. Another company, CF Medical, also had a similar situation
                where customer data was accessed by a cybercriminal in July and
                they notified their customers too.

                  <p>
                    However, that changed in July, when the collections outfit
                    got in touch again to say that, actually, the Comcast
                    subscriber data it held had been pilfered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among the data types stolen were names, addresses, Social
                    Security numbers, dates of birth, and the Comcast account
                    numbers and ID numbers used internally at FBCS. The data
                    pertains to those registered as customers at "around 2021."
                    Comcast stopped using FBCS for debt collection services in
                    2020.

                AI-powered cameras on cars and trucks have been used to capture
                images of political signs, individuals wearing T-shirts with
                text, and vehicles displaying pro-abortion bumper stickers. The
                data, reviewed by WIRED, shows how a tool originally designed
                for traffic enforcement has evolved into a system capable of
                monitoring 'speech' protected by the US Constitution.

                    vehicle shows a "Steelworkers for Harris-Walz" sign stuck in
                    the lawn in front of someone's home. A construction worker,
                    with his face unblurred, is pictured near another Harris
                    sign. Other photos show Trump and Biden (including "Fuck
                    Biden") bumper stickers on the back of trucks and cars
                    across America. One photo, taken in November 2023, shows a
                    partially torn bumper sticker supporting the Obama-Biden
                    lineup.

                    These images were generated by AI-powered cameras mounted on
                    cars and trucks, initially designed to capture license
                    plates, but which are now photographing political lawn signs
                    outside private homes, individuals wearing T-shirts with
                    text, and vehicles displaying pro-abortion bumper
                    stickers—all while recording the precise locations of these

                The detailed photographs all surfaced in search results produced
                by DRN Data, a license-plate-recognition (LPR) company owned by
                Motorola Solutions. The LPR system can be used by private
                investigators, repossession agents, and insurance companies.
                However, files shared with WIRED by artist Julia Weist show that
                those with access to the LPR system can search for common
                phrases or names, such as those of politicians, and be served
                with photographs where the search term is present, even if it is
                not displayed on license plates. The research also reveals the
                extent to which surveillance is happening on a mass scale in the
                quiet streets of America, and how people's personal political
                views and homes can be recorded into vast databases that can be
                queried.

                A lot of security myths have acquired lives of their own and
                taken as facts. Dr. Andy Farnell over at the
                <a href="https://cybershow.uk/blog/">Cyber Show's blog</a> has
                posted an item about
                <a href="https://cybershow.uk/blog/posts/secrets/"
                  >where passwords can still fit in as a part of general
                  authentication</a
                >
                despite what fleets of salesmen selling authentication gimmicks
                tell us.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>Security models: password or tracker?</p>
                  <p>
                    Indeed people do not discriminate two vastly different
                    security models that should really be obvious with a moments
                    thought. The question is, "who is the security <i>for</i>?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Security schemes that ask that you carry around a device
                    which is connected permanently to a network and uses a
                    mechanism that is entirely opaque to you is a
                    <i>different kind of security</i>. It is more than a mere
                    <i>access control</i>. It is not security <i>for you</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It may pass for "something you have" but also has a function
                    to act as a location or close proximity biometric remote
                    sensor for an observer elsewhere. It's a
                    <i>tracking device</i>.

                  <p>
                    [...] Partly it's because we've been using passwords wrong
                    for about the past 40 years. The new NIST document partially
                    puts that right. It's also because there's a massive
                    "security industry" that sells things - and you can't sell
                    people the ability to think up a new password in their own
                    head. Where's the profit in that?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead they'll tell you that you need a fangled security
                    system of gadgets and retina scans, and that you're too
                    stupid to be trusted with your own security. They are wrong.
                    In most cases passwords are just fine if not better than
                    alternatives, and in this post we're going to explain why.

                    Thus another theme of this essay is
                    <i>personal responsibility</i> and the crux of the argument
                    is that all security solutions which are not passwords
                    <i>solve problems that are not yours</i>.

                    Like self-service checkouts at the supermarket that make
                    customers into employees, they are a way of passing blame,
                    liability, and work onto you in order to solve someone elses
                    security problem. As Prof. Ross Anderson bluntly puts it;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <i>
                      "If Alice guards a system but Bob pays the cost of
                      failure, you can expect trouble."

                Cybersecurity has become more harmful than helpful in many cases
                and biometrics are more of a user name than a password despite
                the constant misuse as the latter.

                    All told, there’s now 400 community-owned broadband networks
                    serving more than 700 U.S. towns and cities nationwide, and
                    the pace of growth shows no sign of slowing down.

                    Some of these networks are directly owned by a municipality.
                    Some are freshly-built cooperatives. Some are extensions of
                    the existing city-owned electrical utility. All of them are
                    an organic, popular, grass-roots community-driven reaction

                    Widespread frustration with substandard U.S. broadband drove
                    a big boost in such networks during COVID lockdowns. Since
                    January 1, 2021, more than 47 new networks have come online,
                    with dozens in the planning or pre-construction phases. Many
                    are seeing a big financial boost thanks to 2021 COVID relief
                    (ARPA) and infrastructure bill (IIJA) legislation funding
                    (the latter of which hasn’t even arrived yet).

                    have worked tirelessly to outlaw such efforts, regardless of
                    voter intent. 16 states still have protectionist state laws,

                LG Chem has developed a thin membrane said to greatly reduce the
                chance of fire in Li-Ion batteries. From the abstract,
              </p>

                    Integrating safety features to cut off excessive current
                    during accidental internal short circuits in Li-ion
                    batteries (LIBs) can reduce the risk of thermal runaway.
                    However, making this concept practical requires overcoming
                    challenges in both material development and scalable
                    manufacturing. Here, we demonstrate the roll-to-roll
                    production of a safety reinforced layer (SRL) on current
                    collectors at a rate of 5 km per day. The SRL, made of
                    molecularly engineered polythiophene (PTh) and carbon
                    additives, interrupts current flow during voltage drops or
                    overheating without adversely affecting battery performance.
                    Impact testing on 3.4-Ah pouch cells shows that the SRL
                    reduces battery explosions from 63% to 10%.

                    ... The only catch, now, is that testing has only truly
                    begun. Scaling up to larger capacity battery packs—ones used
                    in EVs, as highlighted by the study—are to begin in 2025. It
                    seems that the CTO of LG Chem, Lee Jong-gu, believes this
                    safety feature will come sooner rather than later: "This is
                    a tangible research achievement that can be applied to mass
                    production in a short period of time. We will enhance safety
                    technology to ensure customers can use electric vehicles
                    with confidence and contribute to strengthening our
                    competitiveness in the battery market." We're sure that many
                    firefighters and motorsports events are probably begging LG
                    Chem to make this technology a top priority.

                    China also has plans to loft thousands of satellites in the

                    and largely for domestic use, in contrast to other network

                    Earlier sessions have traced how OceanGate first developed a
                    carbon-fiber hull for Titan that cracked during deep-sea
                    testing in the Bahamas in 2019, and then commissioned a
                    second hull that was used for dives to the Titanic starting
                    in 2021.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rest of today's hearing focused on the Coast Guard's
                    response after authorities learned that the sub had gone
                    missing a year ago. Capt. Jamie Frederick, who was one of
                    the leaders of the search effort and is now the commander of
                    Coast Guard Sector Boston, recapped the effort to find
                    Titan.

                  <p>
                    [...] Other highlights from the hearing:<br />OceanGate has
                    permanently wound down its operations, an attorney for the
                    company told the investigative board. "The company's primary
                    task has been to cooperate fully with the investigations
                    conducted by the Coast Guard and the NTSB, including in
                    connection with this public hearing," said the attorney,
                    Jane Shvets. "Our law firm, Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, was
                    engaged by OceanGate shortly after the tragedy to assist
                    with that process."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Just after the Titan sub implosion, OceanGate said it was
                    suspending all exploration and commercial operations, but
                    Shvets' comments made clear that the Everett-based company's
                    shutdown is permanent.

                    The Coast Guard doesn't have the resources needed for
                    conducting a subsurface search-and-rescue operation on its
                    own, said Scott Talbot, a search-and-rescue specialist at
                    the Coast Guard.."We only have the capability to do surface
                    search and rescue," Talbot told the board. He is part of a
                    team that reviewed the Titan case to determine how the Coast
                    Guard's capabilities could be improved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is a field that, obviously, the DOD [Department of
                    Defense] is an expert in, but even they don't operate at
                    some of these depths that these commercial companies are
                    doing exploration at," Talbot said. "So to say the Coast
                    Guard is going to effect subsurface search and rescue at
                    these depths ... I don't see it happening."

                      Scientists announced on Thursday a milestone in
                      neurobiological research with the mapping of the entire
                      brain of an adult fruit fly, a feat that may provide
                      insight into brains across the animal kingdom, including
                      people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The research detailed more than 50 million connections
                      between more than 139,000 neurons - brain nerve cells - in
                      the insect, a species whose scientific name is Drosophila
                      melanogaster and is often used in neurobiological studies.
                      The research sought to decipher how brains are wired and
                      the signals underlying healthy brain functions. It also
                      could pave the way for mapping the brains of other
                      species.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      "You might be asking why we should care about the brain of
                      a fruit fly. My simple answer is that if we can truly
                      understand how any brain functions, it's bound to tell us
                      something about all brains," said Princeton University
                      professor of neuroscience and computer science Sebastian
                      Seung, one of the co-leaders of the work published in a
                      series of studies in the journal Nature
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      [...] "And flies are an important model system for
                      neurosciences. Their brains solve many of the same
                      problems we do... They're capable of sophisticated
                      behaviors like the execution of walking and flying,
                      learning and memory behaviors, navigation, feeding and
                      even social interactions, which is a behavior that we
                      studied in my lab at Princeton," Murthy added.

                    During the summer US Mobile announced it is now a “super
                    carrier”, offering the ability to connect to all three major
                    US cellular networks. There’s been a lot of confusion about
                    this new change and how it works. I’ve spent a few months
                    with the carrier getting to know it for that very reason. In
                    this short guide, we explain US Mobile carrier switching and
                    how it works, as well as if it’s as good as it sounds on
                    paper and who it’s best suited for.

                    [...] This process is basically like fully transferring to
                    another network. Though it’s possible to physically swap
                    SIMs for the transfer, an<a

                    is essential if you want this experience to be as simple and
                    painless as possible. Even then, it’s not exactly an instant
                    procedure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It’s a bit both, frankly. While it’s true that US
                    Mobile on paper might sound like it can seamlessly switch
                    between carriers anytime you need better coverage, the
                    reality is more mundane, tedious, and restricted than users
                    might assume initially. The answer to whether it is worth it
                    really depends on your needs. If you travel outside of your
                    home region at least once or twice a month on average and
                    have run into carrier issues, then yes this is a great deal.
                    It’s also nice having the piece of mind to be able to switch
                    anytime there’s extra congestion or a network outage, like
                    the big Verizon outage that recently was in the news.

                    First, they ignored direct instructions telling the officers
                    not to detain the driver. Then they kept him detained for 91
                    minutes which, if nothing else, definitely violates the
                    Supreme Court’s <em>Rodriguez</em> decision — the one that
                    says officers cannot prolong traffic stops without the
                    reasonable suspicion to do so.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The State Police officers didn’t have any of that. All they
                    had was a “no fly” hit that came coupled with instructions
                    stating that his mere presence on this list did not justify
                    further detention. And none of that justified the
                    warrantless search of his truck.

                  <p>
                    And, according to the allegations in the lawsuit, the
                    <em>only</em> reason Meshal was on the FBI’s “no fly” list
                    was because he had refused to become an FBI snitch.

                    people with deportation or further disruption of their
                    travel plans. That a state officer would feel comfortable
                    detaining someone in contravention of direct instructions
                    otherwise makes it clear anyone the government merely wants
                    to <em>pretend</em> is a terrorist is justification enough
                    for any further violation of their rights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the district court level, all involved officers (Janufka,
                    Oglesby, and Wright) were denied qualified immunity for this
                    prolonged, suspicionless detention of Meshal, as well as for
                    the completely unjustified search of his vehicle. They
                    appealed. And the 11th Circuit says, too bad. Maybe don’t
                    violate rights if you don’t like being sued.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The court first cites the <em>Rodriguez</em> decision in
                    response to the officers’ arguments that the stop was not
                    “unreasonably” prolonged. It also addresses their claim that
                    detaining Meshal was necessary, even though the original
                    stop was (allegedly) for him following another driver too
                    closely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for the claim that it was the <em>FBI’s</em> fault the
                    detention took 90 minutes due to officers waiting for a
                    return call from the agency (after ignoring the agency’s
                    direct instructions not to detain the driver), the court is
                    even less sympathetic. An extended stop can’t be justified
                    just because officers chose to involve an outside agency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Driving the point home, the Appeals Court says all of this
                    is stuff officers should know — so clearly established they
                    can’t plausibly claim they weren’t “on notice” that
                    detaining someone on a no fly list (much less searching his
                    truck) for driving isn’t acceptable under the US
                    Constitution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit will continue. And rights that were always
                    present have been reaffirmed, something that’s going to help
                    plenty of people who have been placed on the FBI’s “no fly”
                    list (as this lawsuit alleges) for purely vindictive
                    reasons. I would expect the state of Georgia to settle soon,
                    rather than just wait around for more precedent curbing
                    officer misconduct to be solidified.

                    What is cyber resiliency? And why is it different than cyber
                    protection?<br />A prevention mindset means doing all you
                    can to keep the bad guys out. A resilience mindset adds a
                    layer: while you do all you can to prevent an attack, you
                    also work with the expectation that they still might break
                    through your defenses and invest heavily preparing to
                    respond and recover when the worst happens. Resilient
                    organizations specifically devote significant resources to
                    drawing up plans for what they will do if an attack happens,
                    designing processes to execute them when the time comes, and
                    practicing how to put these plans into action. Prevention is
                    critical — but it's not enough.<br />[...]<br />Yet in my
                    work as a researcher in conversation with chief information
                    security officers and other cyber experts, I have noticed
                    that many leaders focus most, if not all, of their security
                    resources on prevention and leave recovery to business
                    continuity plans that aren't usually designed with cyber
                    incidents in mind. Instead, leaders need to embrace a
                    mindset of cyber-resilience.

                The HBR readership is (I believe) tilted toward C-class
                executives, so this may well filter down into IT departments.
                Anyone here seen any signs of a push toward "resilience"

                    United States from 1930 to 2015. They measured changes in
                    mortality for up to 20 years after each of these storms.
                    Their analysis suggests that an individual hurricane may
                    indirectly lead to thousands of lives lost. And taken
                    together, the storms could have spurred as many as 5 percent
                    of all deaths over that time period. Infants were
                    particularly vulnerable, as were Black populations, the team
                    found.

                    Young and Hsiang don’t know all the ways hurricanes may
                    contribute to mortality, but they have some ideas. It’s
                    possible the stress of a surviving such a storm,
                    or the pollution left in the

                    local governments have less money to spend on health care
                    after rebuilding ravaged infrastructure. It could be some
                    combination of these and other factors, Young says. She’s
                    interested in digging into what’s going on.

                  <p>
                    In the meantime, Young thinks her team’s work highlights the
                    need for new disaster response polices — ones that account
                    for hurricanes’ impact long term. “We really pull together
                    after these disasters to help people immediately in the
                    aftermath,” she says. But “we need to be thinking about
                    these folks long after those initial responses are over.”

                    California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill that
                    requires automakers selling internet-connected cars to do
                    more to protect domestic abuse survivors, a move that may
                    expand such safeguards nationwide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As automakers add ever more sophisticated technology to
                    their cars, instances of stalking and harassment using
                    features such as location tracking and remote controls have
                    begun to emerge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The bill passed the California state legislature with
                    overwhelming support, and Newsom signed it on Friday along
                    with several other measures intended to protect domestic
                    violence survivors. The law could lead to the new standards
                    being implemented beyond California, as automakers tend to
                    avoid producing different cars for different states.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Legislative analysts cited reporting from Reuters and the
                    New York Times about carmakers which did not help women who
                    alleged they were being targeted by their partners. One
                    woman unsuccessfully sued Tesla, alleging the company failed
                    to act after she repeatedly complained that her husband was
                    stalking and harassing her with the automaker's technology
                    despite a restraining order.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among its provisions, the California bill requires
                    automakers to set up a clear process for drivers to submit a
                    copy of a restraining order or other documentation and
                    request termination of another driver's remote access within
                    two business days. It also mandates that carmakers enable
                    drivers to easily turn off location access from inside the
                    vehicle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No carmaker officially opposed the law. The Alliance for
                    Automotive Innovation, which counts several car
                    manufacturers as members, said it supports the goal of
                    protecting victims of domestic abuse. The Alliance raised
                    some concerns about technical feasibility during the
                    legislative process, and a spokesman said in an email on
                    Monday it has discussed ways to potentially address those
                    issues next year.

                While Perfctl and some of the malware it installs are detected
                by some antivirus software, Aqua Security researchers were
                unable to find any research reports on the malware. They were,
                however, able to find a wealth of threads on developer-related
                sites that discussed infections consistent with it.

                    that two servers were infected with a cryptocurrency

                    in the April 2023 post. "However, the process would stop
                    immediately when I logged in via SSH or console. As soon as

                    After exploiting a vulnerability or misconfiguration, the
                    exploit code downloads the main payload from a server,
                    which, in most cases, has been hacked by the attacker and
                    converted into a channel for distributing the malware
                    anonymously. An attack that targeted the researchers'
                    honeypot named the payload httpd. Once executed, the file

                    and deletes the downloaded binary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once moved to the /tmp directory, the file executes under a
                    different name, which mimics the name of a known Linux
                    process. The file hosted on the honeypot was named sh. From
                    there, the file establishes a local command-and-control
                    process and attempts to gain root system rights by
                    exploiting CVE-2021-4043, a privilege-escalation
                    vulnerability that was patched in 2021 in Gpac, a widely
                    used open source multimedia framework.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The malware goes on to copy itself from memory to a handful
                    of other disk locations, once again using names that appear
                    as routine system files. The malware then drops a rootkit, a
                    host of popular Linux utilities that have been modified to
                    serve as rootkits, and the miner. In some cases, the malware
                    also installs software for "proxy-jacking," the term for
                    surreptitiously routing traffic through the infected machine
                    so the true origin of the data isn't revealed.
                  </p>
                  <p>The researchers continued:</p>

                        As part of its command-and-control operation, the
                        malware opens a Unix socket, creates two directories
                        under the /tmp directory, and stores data there that
                        influences its operation. This data includes host
                        events, locations of the copies of itself, process
                        names, communication logs, tokens, and additional log
                        information. Additionally, the malware uses environment
                        variables to store data that further affects its
                        execution and behavior.

                        All the binaries are packed, stripped, and encrypted,
                        indicating significant efforts to bypass defense
                        mechanisms and hinder reverse engineering attempts. The
                        malware also uses advanced evasion techniques, such as
                        suspending its activity when it detects a new user in
                        the btmp or utmp files and terminating any competing
                        malware to maintain control over the infected system.

                    In addition to new funding sources and deployment
                    strategies, the study uncovered overlooked challenges that
                    aren't being widely addressed. Many early GenAI efforts
                    failed due to issues with data quality and the processes
                    used for model training and tuning – topics directly related
                    to provenance (determining the source and characteristics of
                    the model and data) and governance (procedures to ensure
                    output quality and mitigate potential risks).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among medium-sized businesses, a staggering 84% reported
                    having no provenance policies, and 64% lacked governance
                    policies. Large enterprises fared better, but even there,
                    about a quarter had no provenance policies, and a fifth had
                    no governance procedures. (See "<a
                      href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/two-words-critical-genais-future-bob-o-donnell-bhapc/"
                      >Two Words That Are Critical to GenAI's Future</a
                    >" for more on provenance and governance.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The number one benefit that organizations hope to get from
                    their GenAI initiatives is increased efficiency and
                    productivity followed by improved quality and accuracy of
                    output.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While some of the study's findings were surprising, others
                    confirmed what many in the industry have been thinking. The
                    number one benefit that organizations hope to get from their
                    GenAI initiatives, for example, is increased efficiency and
                    productivity followed by improved quality and accuracy of
                    output.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When asked to the rank the importance of the potential
                    outcomes of their GenAI efforts, however, the results showed
                    more pragmatic, measurable results. Most importantly,
                    companies said they wanted to create new products or
                    services with the help of GenAI, and reducing costs was
                    their second most important outcome. Not only does this
                    reflect the fact that benefits and importance don't always
                    align when it comes to these initiatives, but it also
                    indicates that organizations recognize what GenAI can offer
                    now, yet still have more aspirational goals for the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In terms of the GenAI-powered applications that
                    organizations are using, as Figure 3 illustrates, the first
                    and third top choices are text-related with Text-Based
                    Document Creation number one and Text-based Summarization
                    number three.

                    Collaboration-based applications came in second, reflecting
                    the popularity of GenAI features such as meeting
                    summarizations, automatic note-taking, language translation,
                    and other capabilities integrated into messaging platforms.
                    Despite their heavy usage, satisfaction with collaboration
                    tools was found to be lower than with other product
                    categories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study also dives into more detailed aspects of the
                    companies' GenAI efforts, including which foundation models
                    and platforms they're using, why they chose them, techniques
                    for data preparation and model fine-tuning, the deployment
                    of GenAI applications at the edge, on PCs, and on
                    smartphones, as well as the types of partners companies are
                    working with and the specific services they need.

                  <p>
                    Finally, returning to the original theme, GenAI-powered
                    summarization and sentiment analysis of the survey
                    respondents' comments highlight that we're still in the
                    early stages of the GenAI revolution. While companies
                    expressed legitimate concerns about GenAI and its impact,
                    they also made it clear that they understand the long-term
                    potential of the technology and are eager to integrate it
                    into their organizations.

                    Over time, the opportunists may end up convincing
                    themselves. After all, they will eventually have to come to
                    terms with why they are engaging in unethical and deceptive,
                    if not destructive, behavior.<br />[...]<br />So be aware
                    that the next time you share an unfounded conspiracy theory,
                    online or offline, you could be helping an opportunist. They
                    don't buy it, so neither should you.

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Back in February, we celebrated our victory at trial in the
                    U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas
                    against patent trolls Sable IP and Sable Networks. This was
                    the culmination of nearly three years of litigation against
                    Sable, but it wasn't the end of the story.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today we're pleased to announce that the litigation against
                    Sable has finally concluded on terms that we believe send a
                    strong message to patent trolls everywhere — if you bring
                    meritless patent claims against Cloudflare, we will fight
                    back and we will win.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While Sable's technical expert tried his hardest to
                    convince the jury that various software and hardware
                    components of Cloudflare's servers constitute "line cards,"
                    his explanations defied credibility. The simple fact is that
                    Cloudflare's servers do not have line cards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ultimately, the jury understood, returning a verdict
                    that Cloudflare does not infringe claim 25 of the '919
                    patent.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    In the end, Sable agreed to pay Cloudflare $225,000, grant
                    Cloudflare a royalty-free license to its entire patent
                    portfolio, and to dedicate its patents to the public,
                    ensuring that Sable can never again assert them against
                    another company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Let's repeat that first part, just to make sure everyone
                    understands:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sable, the patent troll that sued Cloudflare back in March
                    2021 asserting around 100 claims across four patents, in the
                    end wound up paying Cloudflare. While this $225,000 can't
                    fully compensate us for the time, energy and frustration of
                    having to deal with this litigation for nearly three years,
                    it does help to even the score a bit. And we hope that it
                    sends an important message to patent trolls everywhere to
                    beware before taking on Cloudflare.

                    Officials in Ireland have fined Meta $101 million for
                    storing hundreds of millions of user passwords in plaintext
                    and making them broadly available to company employees.

                    >
                    in early 2019. The company said that apps for connecting to
                    various Meta-owned social networks had logged user passwords
                    in plaintext and stored them in a database that had been
                    searched by roughly 2,000 company engineers, who
                    collectively queried the stash more than 9 million times.<br />[...]<br />When
                    Meta disclosed the lapse in 2019, it was clear the company
                    had failed to adequately protect hundreds of millions of
                    passwords.

                    "It is widely accepted that user passwords should not be
                    stored in plaintext, considering the risks of abuse that
                    arise from persons accessing such data," Graham Doyle,
                    deputy commissioner at Ireland's Data Protection Commission,
                    <a

                    >. "It must be borne in mind, that the passwords, the
                    subject of consideration in this case, are particularly
                    sensitive, as they would enable access to users' social
                    media accounts."<br />[...]<br />To date, the EU has fined
                    Meta more than $2.23 billion (2 billion euros) for
                    violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
                    which went into effect in 2018. That amount includes last

                    Louisiana Democratic political consultant Steven Kramer was
                    indicted in May over the robocalls. The 39-second message,
                    which told people to 'save their votes' for the November
                    presidential election, was created using a text-to-speech
                    tool called ElevenLabs. The calls were spoofed so they
                    appeared to originate from the former chairwoman of the New
                    Hampshire Democratic Party, writes
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/us/politics/biden-robocalls-steve-kramer-democratic-primary.html"
                      >The New York Times</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kramer had worked for Biden's primary rival, Rep. Dean
                    Phillips, who condemned the calls. Kramer claimed that he
                    paid $500 to have the calls sent to voters as a way of
                    raising awareness about the dangers artificial intelligence
                    can pose to election campaigns, which sounds like a
                    questionable justification.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For me to do that and get $5 million worth of exposure, not
                    for me," Kramer told
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bngnTezR7s"
                      >CBS New York</a
                    >. "I kept myself anonymous so the regulations could just
                    play themselves out or begin to play themselves out. I don't
                    need to be famous. That's not my intention. My intention was
                    to make a difference."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Making a strange story even weirder, Kramer hired an actual
                    New Orleans magician named Paul Carpenter to make the
                    robocalls. Carpenter said creating the recording only took
                    about 20 minutes and cost $1, and that Kramer paid him $150
                    via Venmo. He believed what he was doing had been authorized
                    by President Biden's campaign. Carpenter's account has since
                    been shut down by ElevenLabs.

                  <p>
                    The FCC writes that Kramer violated the Truth in Caller ID
                    Act, which makes spoofed calls illegal when made with the
                    intent to defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything
                    of value. The FCC this year
