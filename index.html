                    But isn't that just magnification, then? No—because
                    magnification only makes things bigger! This is easy to
                    demonstrate with a photograph: you can zoom in on the
                    photograph as much as you'd like, but past a certain limit,
                    you're just magnifying the pixels, and you can't get any
                    more information out of it. To break through that wall, you
                    have to gain resolution rather than magnification.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] At its best, Hubble's resolution is about 0.05
                    arcsecond—a <em>very</em> tiny angle! But how much detail it
                    can see in real terms depends on the target's distance and
                    physical size. For example, 0.05 arcsecond is equivalent to
                    the apparent size of a dime seen from about 140 kilometers
                    away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That brings us back to the conspiracy theorists and their
                    gripe about spotting boot prints on the moon. Galaxies are
                    typically tens of millions or even billions of light-years
                    from Earth. At those distances, Hubble can resolve objects a
                    few light-years across—tens of <em>trillions</em> of
                    kilometers—at best. So while it looks like we're seeing
                    galaxies in great detail in those spectacular Hubble images,
                    the smallest thing we can see is still tremendously huge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile the moon is only about 380,000 km from us—and from
                    Hubble. At that distance, Hubble's resolution surprisingly
                    limits it to resolving objects no smaller than about 90
                    meters across. So not only can we <em>not</em> see the
                    astronauts' boot prints in Hubble images but we also can't
                    even see the Apollo lunar landers, which were only about
                    four meters across!

                    In the spring of 2023, when the new planting season was to
                    start, Tope’s company, Carmi Agro Foods, had used
                    GPS-enabled software to map the boundaries of its farm. Its
                    setup on the EOS crop monitoring platform was also
                    completed. Tope used the platform to determine the
                    appropriate spacing for the stems and seeds. The rigors and
                    risks of manual monitoring had disappeared. His
                    field-monitoring officers needed only to peer at their
                    phones to know where or when specific spots needed attention
                    on various farms. He was able to track weed breakouts
                    quickly and efficiently. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This technology is gaining traction among farmers in other
                    parts of Nigeria and the rest of Africa. More than 242,000
                    people in Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, the United
                    States, and Europe use the EOS crop-monitoring platform. In
                    2023 alone, 53,000 more farmers subscribed to the service.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of them is Adewale Adegoke, the CEO of Agro Xchange
                    Technology Services, a company dedicated to boosting crop
                    yields using technology and good agricultural practices.
                    Adegoke used the platform on half a million hectares (around
                    1.25 million acres) owned by 63,000 farmers. He says the
                    yield of maize farmers using the platform, for instance,
                    grew to two tons per acre, at least twice the national
                    average.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Adegoke adds that local farmers, who have been struggling
                    with fluctuating conditions as a result of climate change,
                    have been especially drawn to the platform’s early warning
                    system for weather. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As harvest time draws nearer this year, Tope reports, the
                    prospects of his cassava field, which now spans a thousand
                    hectares, is quite promising. This is thanks in part to his
                    ability to anticipate and counter the sudden dry spells. He
                    spaced the plantings better and then followed advisories on
                    weeding, fertilizer use, and other issues related to the
                    health of the crops. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “So far, the result has been convincing,” says Tope. “We are
                    no longer subjecting the performance of our farms to chance.
                    This time, we are in charge.”

                    Starbuck, a former Hollywood music video director turned
                    conservative activist, has claimed credit for these moves.
                    But business experts have told CNN that Starbuck's activism
                    alone does not fully explain these decisions, and some
                    companies' commitments to diversity and inclusion were thin

                    The Human Rights Campaign criticized Ford's announcement,
                    saying the company was "abandoning inclusive employees
                    policies and support" and "cowering" to Starbuck.

                    Motor Company is abandoning its financial duty to recruit
                    and keep top talent from across the full talent pool. In
                    making their purchasing decisions, consumers should take
                    note that Ford Motor Company has abandoned its commitment to
                    our communities."

                    [...] This vulnerability was originally discovered by
                    examining our honeypot logs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The vulnerability lies in the brightness function within the
                    file /cgi-bin/supervisor/Factory.cgi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the exploit examples we observed, essentially what
                    happened is this: The exploit of this vulnerability allows
                    an attacker to execute remote code on a target system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Figure 3 is an example of a threat actor exploiting this
                    flaw to download and run a JavaScript file to fetch and load
                    their main malware payload. Similar to many other botnets,
                    this one is also spreading a variant of Mirai malware to its
                    targets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this instance, the botnet is likely using the Corona
                    Mirai variant, which has been referenced by other vendors as
                    early as 2020 in relation to the COVID-19 virus.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Upon execution, the malware connects to a large number of
                    hosts through Telnet on ports 23, 2323, and 37215. It also
                    prints the string “Corona” to the console on an infected
                    host (Figure 4).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Static analysis of the strings in the malware samples shows
                    targeting of the path /ctrlt/DeviceUpgrade_1 in an attempt
                    to exploit Huawei devices affected by CVE-2017-17215. The
                    samples have two hard-coded command and control IP
                    addresses, one of which is part of the CVE-2017-17215
                    exploit code:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The botnet also targeted several other vulnerabilities
                    including a Hadoop YARN RCE, CVE-2014-8361, and
                    CVE-2017-17215. We have observed these vulnerabilities
                    exploited in the wild several times, and they continue to be
                    successful.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Given that this camera model is no longer supported, the
                    best course of action for anyone using one is to replace it.
                    As with all Internet-connected devices, IoT devices should
                    never be accessible using the default credentials that
                    shipped with them.

                    Accounts that the platform previously has shut down on
                    Brazilian orders include lawmakers affiliated with former
                    President Jair Bolsonaro's right-wing party and activists
                    accused of undermining Brazilian democracy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Musk, a self-proclaimed "free speech absolutist," has
                    repeatedly claimed the justice's actions amount to
                    censorship, and his argument has been echoed by Brazil's
                    political right. He has often insulted de Moraes on his
                    platform, characterizing him as a dictator and tyrant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    De Moraes' defenders have said his actions aimed at X have
                    been lawful, supported by most of the court's full bench and
                    have served to protect democracy at a time in which it is
                    imperiled. His order Friday is based on Brazilian law
                    requiring foreign companies to have representation in the
                    country so they can be notified when there are legal cases
                    against them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Given that operators are aware of the widely publicized
                    standoff and their obligation to comply with an order from
                    de Moraes, plus the fact doing so isn't complicated, X could
                    be offline as early as 12 hours after receiving their
                    instructions, said Luca Belli, coordinator of the Technology
                    and Society Center at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a
                    university in Rio de Janeiro.
                  </p>
                  <p>The shutdown is not unprecedented in Brazil.</p>
                  <p>
                    Lone Brazilian judges shut down Meta's WhatsApp, the
                    nation's most widely used messaging app, several times in
                    2015 and 2016 due to the company's refusal to comply with
                    police requests for user data. In 2022, de Moraes threatened
                    the messaging app Telegram with a nationwide shutdown,
                    arguing it had repeatedly ignored Brazilian authorities'
                    requests to block profiles and provide information. He
                    ordered Telegram to appoint a local representative; the
                    company ultimately complied and stayed online.

                    X and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in
                    several countries — mostly authoritarian regimes such as
                    Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and
                    Turkmenistan. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Turkey and
                    Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to
                    quell dissent and unrest. Twitter was banned in Egypt after
                    the Arab Spring uprisings, which some dubbed the "Twitter
                    revolution," but it has since been restored.

                    To retrieve past stress information, LNNO is applied as a
                    coating on the surface of an object and then irradiated with
                    a flashlight. The afterglow produced by LNNO can be measured
                    using cameras or light sensors. The study demonstrated that
                    the afterglow image matches quantitatively with the results
                    obtained through finite element method analysis.
                    Additionally, the research confirmed that LNNO retains this
                    stress information even after a period of five months.

                    [...] Finally, I'd like to end this piece with a comment on
                    the Cable TV-ification of the web. A core belief that Anand
                    and I have held dear for years, and is still on our

                      >About page</a
                    >
                    to this day, is AnandTech's rebuke of sensationalism, link
                    baiting, and the path to shallow 10-o'clock-news reporting.
                    It has been our mission over the past 27 years to inform and
                    educate our readers by providing high-quality content – and
                    while we're no longer going to be able to fulfill that role,
                    the need for quality, in-depth reporting has not changed. If
                    anything, the need has increased as social media and
                    changing advertising landscapes have made shallow,
                    sensationalistic reporting all the more lucrative.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For all the tech journalists out there right now – or tech
                    journalists to be – I implore you to remain true to
                    yourself, and to your readers' needs. In-depth reporting
                    isn't always as sexy or as exciting as other avenues, but
                    now, more than ever, it's necessary to counter
                    sensationalism and cynicism with high-quality reporting and
                    testing that is used to support thoughtful conclusions. To
                    quote Anand: "I don't believe the web needs to be academic
                    reporting or sensationalist garbage - as long as there's a
                    balance, I'm happy."

                    King and her UC Berkeley colleagues described the organism —
                    which they named <i>Barroeca monosierra,</i> after the lake
                    — in a paper published in the journal <i>mBio</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nearly 10 years ago, then-UC Berkeley graduate student
                    Daniel Richter came back from a climbing trip in the Eastern
                    Sierra Nevada with a vial of Mono Lake water he’d casually
                    collected along the way. Under the microscope, it was alive
                    with choanoflagellates. Other than brine shrimp, alkali
                    flies and various species of nematode, few other forms of
                    life have been reported to live in the inhospitable waters
                    of the lake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] At the time, however, King was occupied with
                    <a
                      href="https://www.hhmi.org/news/newly-discovered-microorganisms-band-together-flip-out"
                      >other species of choanos</a
                    >, as she calls them, so the Mono Lake choanos languished in
                    the freezer until some students revived and stained them to
                    look at their unusual, doughnut-shaped chromosomes.
                    Surprisingly, there was also DNA inside the hollow colony
                    where there should have been no cells. After further
                    investigation, graduate student Kayley Hake determined that
                    they were bacteria.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The bacteria were a huge surprise. That just was
                    fascinating,” King said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hake also detected connective structures, called
                    extracellular matrix, inside the spherical colony that were
                    secreted by the choanos. Only then did it occur to Hake and
                    King that these might not be the remains of bacteria the
                    choanos ate, but bacteria living and grazing on stuff
                    secreted by the colony.

                    convicted on one count of money laundering. Lacey, 76, was

                    million in revenue from running a forum that facilitated
                    prostitution. While Lacey argued that he wasn't involved in
                    day-to-day operations, US District Judge Diane Humetewa
                    "told Lacey during Wednesday's sentencing he was aware of

                    too heavily on claims of child sex trafficking in a case
                    that did not involve any charges of child sex trafficking.
                    At the time, Judge Susan Brnovich said she gave the
                    government leeway to mention child sex trafficking, but the
                    "government abused that leeway."

                    This post introduces some tricks for jailbreaking hosts
                    behind "secure" enterprise firewalls in order to enable
                    arbitrary inbound and outbound requests over any protocol.
                    You'll probably find the tricks outlined in the post useful
                    if you need to deploy software in a hostile networking
                    environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The motivation for these tricks is that you might be a
                    vendor that sells software that runs in a customer's
                    datacenter (a.k.a. on-premises software), so your software
                    has to run inside of a restricted network environment. You
                    (the vendor) can ask the customer to open their firewall for
                    your software to communicate with the outside world (e.g.
                    your own datacenter or third party services), but customers
                    will usually be reluctant to open their firewall more than
                    necessary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, you might want to ssh into your host so that
                    you can service, maintain, or upgrade the host, but if you
                    ask the customer to open their firewall to let you ssh in
                    they'll usually push back on or outright reject the request.
                    Moreover, this isn't one of those situations where you can
                    just ask for forgiveness instead of permission because you
                    can't begin to do anything without explicitly requesting
                    some sort of firewall change on their part.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So I'm about to teach you a bunch of tricks for efficiently
                    tunneling whatever you want over seemingly innocuous
                    openings in a customer's firewall.....

                We are not condoning such actions, but you cannot secure your

                    in a viral "blackout challenge" in which users of the social

                    U.S. Circuit Judge Patty Shwartz, writing for the
                    three-judge panel, said that Section 230 of the
                    Communications Decency Act of 1996 only immunizes
                    information provided by third parties and not

                    rulings by her court and others holding that Section 230
                    immunizes an online platform from liability for failing to

                    social media platforms to curb content they deem
                    objectionable violate their free speech rights.<br />In
                    those cases, the Supreme Court held a platform's algorithm
                    reflects "editorial judgments" about "compiling the
                    third-party speech it wants in the way it wants." Shwartz
                    said under that logic, content curation using algorithms is
                    speech by the company itself, which is not protected by
                    Section 230.

                    Forcing customers to replace an entire system just because
                    the cheapest component failed might be really profitable, I
                    have no idea... But I do know that it annoyed me enough to
                    make me want to fix it myself. While I understand that what
                    I do next is beyond a large number of Advantage Air
                    customers, in my investigation I found that there seems to
                    be only software choices preventing modern tablets from
                    working with older control systems. Adding a simple "system"
                    chooser to their software applications would give solutions
                    to everyone, while the custom POE connector would ensure
                    they still need their hardware.

                    My family had a new home built in 2019. As part of the build
                    package a large ducted reverse cycle (heatpump) air
                    conditioning system was installed. As it was part of the
                    entire build I am not sure on the specific price of this
                    system but based on other quotes I have seen for a similar
                    sized house I would guess $10k-$12k. The system has two main
                    parts, the actual Daikin airconditioner and an Advantage Air
                    control box in attic that opens the vents to the various
                    zones. This control system is operated by a cheap POE
                    powered Android tablet on the wall of the living room.

                    [...] E-Zone running perfectly on an ancient Samsung Galaxy
                    Tab 4. I was elated. After I gave up on repairing the
                    original, getting this tablet working took only a few hours
                    and was a hell of a lot of fun. This tablet is 10+ years old
                    and yet still is much snappier than the junk that came with
                    the system, but if I want to upgrade to something more
                    powerful, say to control my homeassistant etc... all I need
                    to do is plug it into the usb. But for turning the AC on and
                    off it is more than enough and I am currently waiting on a
                    nice flush connector to arrive then will mount it on the
                    wall.

                    The team used an attosecond X-ray pulse from SLAC’s
                    <a href="https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/"
                      >Linac Coherent Light Source</a

                    (LCLS), just billionths of a billionth of a second long, to
                    ionize core-level electrons. This process ejected the
                    electrons from the molecules they were studying. They then
                    used a separate laser pulse, which kicked the electrons in a
                    slightly different direction depending on the time they were
                    emitted, to measure the so-called “photoemission delay.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The photoemission delay can be thought of as the time
                    between a molecule absorbing a photon and emitting an
                    electron. These delays, reaching up to 700 attoseconds, were
                    significantly larger than previously predicted, challenging
                    existing theoretical models and opening new avenues for
                    understanding electron behavior. The researchers also
                    discovered that interactions between electrons played an
                    important role in this delay.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “By measuring the angular difference in the direction of the
                    ejected electrons, we could determine the time delay with
                    high precision,” said co-author and SLAC scientist James
                    Cryan. “The ability to measure and interpret these delays
                    helps scientists better analyze experimental results,
                    particularly in fields like protein crystallography and
                    medical imaging, where X-ray interactions with matter are
                    crucial.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study is one of the first in a series of planned
                    experiments aimed at exploring the depths of electron
                    dynamics in different molecular systems. Other research
                    groups have already started using the developed technique to
                    study larger and more complex molecules, revealing new
                    facets of electron behavior and molecular structure.

                  <p>
                    “This is a developing field,” said co-author Agostino
                    Marinelli. “The flexibility of LCLS allows us to probe a
                    wide range of energies and molecular systems, making it a
                    powerful tool for making these types of measurements. This
                    is just the beginning of what we can achieve on these
                    extreme timescales.”

                    The bill, which has been a flashpoint for debate in Silicon
                    Valley and beyond, would obligate AI companies operating in
                    California to implement a number of precautions before they
                    train a sophisticated foundation model. Those include making
                    it possible to quickly and fully shut the model down,
                    ensuring the model is protected against “unsafe
                    post-training modifications,” and maintaining a testing
                    procedure to evaluate whether a model or its derivatives is
                    especially at risk of “causing or enabling a critical harm.”

                    SB 1047 is a highly reasonable bill that asks large AI labs
                    to do what they’ve already committed to doing: test their
                    large models for catastrophic safety risk. “We’ve worked
                    hard all year, with open source advocates, Anthropic, and
                    others, to refine and improve the bill. SB 1047 is well
                    calibrated to what we know about forseeable AI risks, and it
                    deserves to be enacted.”

                    With impressive speed and candor, Rocket Factory Augsburg
                    (RFA) has provided an update on the anomaly that caused last
                    week's rocket firing at SaxaVord in Shetland, Scotland, to
                    end explosively.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first stage of RFA's rocket explodes on the SaxaVord
                    launchpad
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Brieschenk described the anomaly as "a very unusual one."
                    The leading theory is that there was a fire in an oxygen
                    pump, which is difficult to contain and certainly more than
                    the systems on the stage and launch pad could handle. The
                    damage rapidly spread to the other engines, and despite the
                    stage triggering an emergency stop, the explosion happened
                    shortly after.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The horizontal jet of flame from the base of the stage was
                    indicative of the severity of the damage. Brieschenk
                    explained that the compromised engines had damaged the
                    manifold to such an extent that kerosene began leaking from
                    the vent lines. "That was really the point of no return," he
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The kerosene fueled the fire. The flames grew more intense
                    and eventually became an oxygen-fed blaze so severe that
                    "large portions of engines were simply combusted."
                    Brieschenk said the CO<sub>2</sub> and water fire
                    suppression systems were not adequately sized to deal with
                    the unfolding damage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite the inevitable delay following the explosion,
                    Brieschenk was keen to highlight that the stage collapsed in
                    a manner which caused it to topple away from the launch
                    pad's umbilical tower. As a result, the pad remained
                    relatively unscathed, aside from elements like the launch
                    stool that were designed to support the stage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although Brieschenk said RFA was confident in the design of
                    the offending turbopump, he also noted that more than 100
                    improvements were being made to the next first stage, which
                    is currently under construction. Many of these improvements
                    aim to prevent a repeat of the SaxaVord incident, where a
                    single turbopump failure led to the loss of the entire
                    stage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The need to wait for the completion of this first stage,
                    originally intended for the second flight of the RFA One,
                    means that the inaugural launch has been postponed to 2025.
                    The other components, like the second stage, for example,
                    are already at SaxaVord.

                  <p>
                    The company said it was being as transparent as possible
                    regarding the mishap and was sharing its own raw footage of
                    the incident. It wrote: "Maybe other companies or
                    prospective engineers can learn from it."

                    Like many, Sam Curry and I spend a lot of time waiting in
                    airport security lines. If you do this enough, you might
                    sometimes see a special lane at airport security called
                    Known Crewmember (KCM). KCM is a TSA program that allows
                    pilots and flight attendants to bypass security screening,
                    even when flying on domestic personal trips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The KCM process is fairly simple: the employee uses the
                    dedicated lane and presents their KCM barcode or provides
                    the TSA agent their employee number and airline. Various
                    forms of ID need to be presented while the TSA agent's
                    laptop verifies the employment status with the airline. If
                    successful, the employee can access the sterile area without
                    any screening at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A similar system also exists for cockpit access, called the
                    Cockpit Access Security System (CASS). Most aircraft have at
                    least one jumpseat inside the cockpit sitting behind the
                    flying pilots. When pilots need to commute or travel, it is
                    not always possible for them to occupy a revenue seat, so a
                    jumpseat can be used instead. CASS allows the gate agent of
                    a flight to verify that the jumpseater is an authorized
                    pilot. The gate agent can then inform the crew of the flight
                    that the jumpseater was authenticated by CASS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The employment status check is the most critical component
                    of these processes. If the individual doesn't currently work
                    for an airline, they have not had a background check and
                    should not be permitted to bypass security screening or
                    access the cockpit. This process is also responsible for
                    returning the photo of the crewmember to ensure the right
                    person is being authorized for access. So how does this
                    work, when every airline presumably uses a different system
                    to store their employee information? That is what we were
                    wondering, and where it gets interesting...

                    Over the past few decades, scientists have generated a pile
                    of evidence suggesting that a diet rich in saturated fats is
                    enough to cause heart diseases. Besides other problems like
                    diabetes and atherosclerosis, saturated fats have also been
                    linked to life-threatening arrhythmias.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Interestingly, based on animal and human studies, certain
                    omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids seem to have beneficial
                    effects on cardiovascular health. In particular,
                    eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which is found in fish oil, not
                    only has vasodilator and antiplatelet effects, but can even
                    help prevent atrial fibrillation and other arrythmias.
                    Despite EPA being readily available as a dietary supplement,
                    the effect of EPA on cardiomyocytes and their underlying
                    mechanisms of action are not fully understood.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a recent study published online in the
                    <em>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</em>, a
                    research team from Japan set out to bridge this knowledge
                    gap. Led by Associate Professor Masaki Morishima from Kindai
                    University, they investigated the role of EPA in inducing
                    long-term electrical changes in cultured mouse
                    cardiomyocytes using a variety of bioanalytical techniques.
                    Their research article was co-authored by Dr. Katsushige Ono
                    from Oita University and Dr. Kazuki Horikawa from Tokushima
                    University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The main focus of this work was on how an oleic
                    acid/palmitic acid mixture (OAPA), two well-studied
                    saturated fats, impact calcium homeostasis in cardiomyocytes
                    by affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion channels, and whether EPA
                    can rescue these changes and restore normal functioning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Put together, this study has shed some much needed
                    light on the underlying mechanisms by which EPA could
                    bolster heart health. “Although there are techniques and
                    drugs to control arrythmias, methods to prevent them have
                    not been established,” remarks Dr. Morishima. Adding
                    further, she states, “The results of our study suggest that
                    EPA has a protective effect on cardiomyocytes by normalizing
                    abnormalities caused by the intake of excessive amounts of
                    saturated fatty acids, which occurs in high-fat diets.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team envisions that these findings will pave the way for
                    smarter dietary choices and new health guidelines. “While
                    research on nutrients and disease prevention can take a long
                    time, studies like ours lay the groundwork for practical
                    nutritional strategies that could seamlessly fit into
                    everyday diet,” concludes Dr. Morishima, hoping for a
                    healthier future.

                    Formaster called their copy protection technology
                    "Copy-Lock," a name which, unfortunately, several other

                    protection schemes on those platforms could be much more

                    When he purchased the album for $2 million in 2015, he also
                    acquired 50 percent of the copyrights to the package. Before
                    the album was seized by the government, Shkreli says he took
                    advantage of his copyright ownership to make copies as he
                    was "permitted to do under his original purchase
                    agreement."<br />[...]<br />On August 26, 2024, a federal

                    (PDF) in the case as the two parties prepare to battle
                    things out in court. The injunction prevents Shkreli from
                    "possessing, using, disseminating, or selling any interest
                    in the Wu-Tang Clan album 'Once Upon a Time in Shaolin' (the
                    'Album'), including its data and files or the contents of
                    the Album."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, Shkreli has to turn over "all of his copies, in
                    any form, of the Album or its contents to defense counsel."
                    He also must file an affidavit swearing that he "no longer
                    possesses any copies, in any form, of the Album or its
                    contents."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By the end of September 2024, Shkreli further must submit a
                    list of "the names and contact information of the
                    individuals to whom he distributed the data and files" and
                    say if he made any money for doing so.

                The article goes into detail on the steps that were required,
                including finding an operational pay phone, and it ends with the
                steps summarized:

                  <p>
                    1. Obtain a phone. It doesn't need to have an active phone
                    number associated with it, and can be either an old phone
                    you have around or a dedicated burner phone.
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Locate a pay phone.</p>
                  <p>
                    3. Find the pay phone's phone number (call 1-800-444-4444 if
                    it's not written on the phone).
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Make sure the pay phone can receive incoming calls.</p>
                  <p>
                    5. Enter the pay phone number into Signal, and use the 'Call
                    me' option to receive a verification call (this option shows
                    up only after the SMS timer runs out).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    6. Input the confirmation code, set up a PIN and enable
                    Registration Lock in the Signal app.

                    PyScript is a brand-new framework that caused a lot of
                    excitement when
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/pwang">Peter Wang</a>, the CEO
                    and co-founder of
                    <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda, Inc.</a>,
                    revealed it during his
                    <a

                      >PyCon US 2022</a
                    >. Although this project is just an experiment in an early
                    phase of development, people on
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/pyscript_dev">social media</a>
                    seem to have already fallen in love with it. This tutorial
                    will get you up to speed with PyScript, while the official
                    documentation is still in the making.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] One of the goals of PyScript is to make the Web a
                    friendly place for anyone wanting to learn to code,
                    including kids. The framework achieves that goal by not
                    requiring any installation or configuration process beyond
                    your existing text editor and a browser. A side effect is
                    that PyScript simplifies sharing your work with others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In other words, PyScript allows you to use Python,
                    with or without JavaScript, to build interactive websites
                    that don't necessarily have to communicate with a server.
                    The main benefit here is that you can leverage your existing
                    knowledge of Python to enter the world of front-end
                    development, lowering the entry barrier and making it more
                    accessible. But there are many other benefits of using
                    PyScript that you'll learn about later.
                  </p>

                    PyScript wouldn't be possible without building on top of a
                    recent version of
                    <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Pyodide</a>—a

                    <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, enabling
                    Python to run in the browser. PyScript provides a thin
                    abstraction layer over Pyodide by encapsulating the required

                    The study “not only sheds more light on the far-reaching
                    effects of climate change on ocean environments but
                    highlights that marine conservation and management efforts
                    need to plan for these ongoing changes. If migratory fish
                    are on the move, fishing vessels and coastal communities
                    will also need to adapt. Studies like this will help marine
                    resource agencies be even more dynamic in their
                    decision-making,” said study co-author Tobey Curtis, a
                    fishery management specialist in the Atlantic Highly
                    Migratory Species Management Division of NOAA Fisheries.

                    [...] “We are doing our best to try to figure out what will
                    happen, so that people can adapt and so that we can develop
                    climate-resilient or climate-ready management policies,”
                    Braun said.

                    He said that historic ways to manage fisheries are static,
                    even though fish move around a lot. “We basically draw a box
                    in the ocean and say whether you can or can’t fish there,”
                    he said. Dynamic ocean management frameworks “must embody
                    expected changes. Otherwise, you are left with your static
                    box in the ocean that doesn’t move, even though the fish may
                    have moved, and the ocean may have changed.”

                    The number of bit barns currently under construction has
                    exploded in the wake of the AI boom, surging nearly 70
                    percent in North America's top markets over the past year to
                    a record high of 3.87 gigawatts, according to a newly
                    published CBRE report.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fastest-growing regions include Atlanta, where the
                    number of datacenter developments increased 76 percent
                    year-over-year to roughly 1.3 gigawatts of capacity.
                    Meanwhile, in Austin and San Antonio, Texas, the report
                    clocked 463 megawatts of new capacity under development,
                    more than quadruple that of the previous year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This rapid expansion of compute resources, however, is being
                    hampered by a shortage of power and extended lead times for
                    critical electrical infrastructure necessary to bring these
                    facilities online, resulting in delays.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When these facilities do come online, only about 20 percent
                    of it will actually be up for grabs for you and I. Nearly 80
                    percent of the 3.87 gigawatts of new capacity has already
                    been spoken for by the major hyperscalers, cloud providers,
                    and rent-a-GPU operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite this, CBRE
                    <a
                      href="https://www.cbre.com/insights/reports/north-america-data-center-trends-h1-2024"
                      >reports</a
                    >
                    that DC capacity in major markets was up 10 percent in the
                    first half of 2024, with 1.1 gigawatts having come online in
                    the past year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Going forward, CBRE predicts secondary markets in
                    Northern Indiana, Idaho, Arkansas, and Kansas will become
                    hotspots for hyperscale expansion thanks to their abundance
                    of cheap land and power.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Speaking of power, a shortage of transformers, switches, and
                    generators is expected to continue to plague development
                    timelines potentially by as much as four years. If that
                    weren't enough, CBRE notes that if you need that capacity,
                    customers should expect to prelease space between two and
                    four years ahead of time.

                The Japanese semiconductor manufacturer Renesas has completed
                the acquisition of PCB Layout Software Maker Altium (<a

                >). Renesas paid $5.9bn for Altium, which had a revenue of $263m
                in 2023. Along with the PCB software, Renesas now have control
                of component search website Octopart, which Altium acquired in
                2017.

                    This acquisition is aimed at enhancing its capabilities in
                    digital device design and supporting its digital
                    transformation. This move propels Renesas to become a
                    comprehensive solutions provider rather than just a chip
                    vendor, strengthening its position in the competitive
                    landscape.

                competition for Altium in recent years. What do Soylentils think
                about the reasons why Renesas spent such a premium over the core
                business size?

              <p>
                From the "everything is ruined by advertising" comes this gem:

                <a href="https://www.vodxs.com/">https://www.vodxs.com/</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                Now some fool's decided to mount advertising screens to the tops
                of washroom faucets, because, well, I guess you got nothing
                better to do while washing your hands than look at a stupid ad
                at the same time.
              </p>
              <p>
                How long do you think these will last in the real world before
                the users break the screens so they no longer have to look at
                the stupid ads?
              </p>
              <p>
                I cannot imagine these lasting long in many public places.
                Perhaps in an office building or somewhere similar but elsewhere
                I would imagine their life will be measured in days. They will
                have to be powered so now each faucet will have to be wired up -
                never a good idea where water is involved. So what is the
                financial incentive for the place where they will be installed.
                Will somebody else will be getting free advertising from
                something that the installer has had to pay for? Who pays for
                their running costs? Does the manufacturer pay for the
                installation and upkeep? If so, how do they see this making them
                money?
              </p>

                    The dramatic drop in Antarctic sea ice over the last couple
                    of years makes these rafting connections particularly
                    concerning.

                  <p>
                    "Sea ice is very abrasive and so acts as a barrier for many
                    non-native species to successfully establish around
                    Antarctica," Dr. Dawson says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If the recent decline in Antarctic sea ice continues, then
                    living things floating at the surface, or attached to
                    floating objects, could have an easier time colonizing the
                    continent, which may have big impacts on ecosystems."

                    What you would do with a hulking mainframe system like this
                    in 2024 is harder to fathom. We mentioned that the IBM 7070
                    up for auction was used in some weapons research role. They
                    were also positioned as useful for research fields spanning
                    aerospace engineering, weather forecasting, and nuclear
                    sciences.

                    However, in 2024, the smartphone in your pocket or a humble
                    Raspberry Pi will comprehensively outgun this type of
                    machine in terms of processing power. Thus, it is probably
                    destined to be bought up by a museum, educational
                    institution, or exhibition space. It might also be a good
                    purchase for TV/Movie studios for some historical or
                    retro-science scenes.

                    The Dutch data protection authority (DPA) has hit Uber with
                    a €290mn fine for transferring personal European driver data
                    to the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the DPA, the transfers constituted a "serious
                    violation" of the EU's
                    <a
                      href="https://next.thenextweb.com/news/gdpr-turns-five-half-the-fines-have-gone-to-meta-facebook"
                      >GDPR</a
                    >, as they failed to provide the necessary safeguards for
                    data storage outside the block.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Following an investigation, the DPA found that, between
                    August 2021 and November 2023, Uber was transferring and
                    storing sensitive data to US servers without the additional
                    protection tools required by the GDPR.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The data included taxi licences, account and payment
                    details, IDs, photos, and even criminal or medical records.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The investigation was prompted by a complaint from
                    over 170 French drivers to local human rights organisation
                    Ligue des droits de l'Homme (LDH). LDH then filed a
                    complaint to France's data protection watchdog CNIL.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the GDPR, companies processing data across the
                    EU must answer to a single privacy authority, located in the
                    country where a business has its European headquarters. As
                    Uber's base is in the Netherlands, the DPA led the probe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The DPA said that Uber has now stopped the practice. It's
                    also going to appeal the decision.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is the third fine the Dutch watchdog imposes on Uber.
                    In 2018, the DPA hit the company with

                    for failing to notify the agency on time over a data breach
                    in 2016. And as of January this year, Uber is also facing a

                    on August 22 that the company was able to integrate Amazon
                    Q, its generative AI assistant, into its internal systems to
                    update its foundational software.
                  </p>
                  <p>The result has been a "game changer," Jassy said.</p>
                  <p>
                    "The average time to upgrade an application to Java 17
                    plummeted from what's typically 50 developer-days to just a
                    few hours," he wrote. "We estimate this has saved us the
                    equivalent of 4500 developer-years of work (yes, that number
                    is crazy but, real)."

                    The AI is not only fast but seems pretty accurate, too,
                    according to his post. Amazon developers shipped 79% of the
                    AI-generated code reviews without any additional changes,

                    nutritional yeast and has a balance of fats, carbohydrates,
                    and proteins, said Techtmann.

                    describing the microbial portion of the Michigan Tech
                    project, and said that the group’s plans are feasible. But
                    he pointed out a significant challenge: At the moment, only
                    certain microorganisms are considered safe to eat, namely
                    “those we have been eating thorough fermented food and
                    beverages, such as lactic acid bacteria, bacillus, some
                    yeasts.” But these don’t degrade plastics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before using the plastic-eating microbes as food for humans,
                    the research team will submit evidence to regulators
                    indicating that the substance is safe. Joshua Pearce, an
                    electrical engineer at Western University in Ontario,
                    Canada, performed the initial toxicology screening, breaking
                    the microbes down into smaller pieces, which they compared
                    against known toxins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Even if the plastic-eating microbes turn out to be
                    safe for human consumption, Techtmann said, the public might
                    still balk at the prospect of eating something nourished on
                    plastic waste. For this reason, he said, this particular
                    group of microbes might prove most useful on remote military
                    bases or during disaster relief, where it could be consumed
                    short-term, to help people survive.

                    short-lived Echo Show 8 Photos Edition and PhotosPlus

                    While NASA and Boeing maintain that Starliner is ready to
                    take the two crew members down to the surface in the case of

                    For one, Starliner's spacesuits aren't compatible with those
                    used on board SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft. That means if
                    the pair were to return on board the SpaceX capsule

                    While "launch and entry" or intravehicular (IVA) spacesuits,
                    unlike extravehicular activity (EVA) suits, are worn as a
                    precaution inside spacecraft in case of cabin pressure loss,
                    they could still prove life-saving if an emergency were to
                    occur. They can also help with temperature regulation, and
                    in some cases collect data and pass it on to the
                    spacecraft's software.

                    originally being designed to be occupied by a crew of seven.
                    That means their suits wouldn't have anywhere to plug in

                    The spinal cord plays a critical role in controlling
                    movement and other vital functions, and the ability to
                    record spinal neurons with fine-grained spatial and temporal
                    resolution during unrestrained motion offers a window into
                    the mechanisms that make this possible. Using spinalNET,
                    researchers discovered that the spinal neurons in the
                    central pattern generator — the neuronal circuit that can
                    produce rhythmic motor patterns such as walking in the
                    absence of specific timing information — seem to be involved
                    with a lot more than rhythmic movement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Some of them are strongly correlated with leg movement, but
                    surprisingly, a lot of neurons have no obvious correlation
                    with movement,” Wu said. “This indicates that the spinal
                    circuit controlling rhythmic movement is more complicated
                    than we thought.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers said they hope to help unravel some of this
                    complexity in future research, tackling questions such as
                    the difference between how spinal neurons process reflex
                    motion ⎯ getting startled, for instance ⎯ versus volitional
                    action.

                    and is likely down between 75 and 85% from when Elon took
                    over. And now the Wall Street Journal has a piece
                    recognizing that the banks that financed about $13 billion
                    of the $44 billion Musk needed are admitting that it

                  <p>
                    The headline of the article actually underplays the story,
                    calling it “the worst buyout for banks since the financial
                    crisis.” But that’s just based on the “hang” — the length of
                    time the deal has remained on their books. You see, the way
                    this <em>normally</em> works is that the big banks lend the
                    money and then almost immediately turn around and sell off
                    the debt to other suckers to deal with.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, in the case of Musk and Twitter, the banks immediately
                    rubber-stamped it on the basis of “Ooooh, that Elon, doesn’t
                    he always make money?” and without doing much (if any) due
                    diligence. The entities who would buy the debt actually care
                    about the return (or lack thereof) and were quick to
                    recognize that Musk was going to tank Twitter’s revenue
                    potential.

                  <p>
                    Some of this was known before. Just as Musk was about to
                    officially gain control of Twitter, it was reported that the
                    banks were regretting their decision as they realized they

                  <p>
                    To make matters worse for all involved, it has been reported
                    that the banks agreed to a
                    <a
                      href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/06/elon-musk-twitter-x-financing-wall-street-banks/"

                    >, preventing any bank from taking a deal that isn’t offered
                    to the rest of them. But to make matters even worse for Elon
                    specifically, he apparently
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/elon-musk-told-bankers-they-wouldnt-lose-any-money-on-twitter-purchase/"
                      >promised the bankers they wouldn’t lose money</a
                    >
                    on this deal. It’s unclear how binding that promise is, and
                    Musk is somewhat infamous for breaking promises. But it
                    certainly could impact his ability to borrow in the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That said, the WSJ article highlights that the banks have
                    had to hang on to the (greatly devalued) loans for a record
                    length of time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Maybe the banks will think about due diligence next time? I
                    mean, it was no secret that the basic ideas Musk laid out
                    for how he was going to run Twitter were absolute nonsense
                    from Day One.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, while the headline and the beginning of the piece
                    compare the performance of this deal to the financial
                    crisis, they admit deeper in the article that it may just be
                    one of the worst of all time...[.]

                    Durov, 39, was said to have been arrested at 8pm French
                    time, having flown in from Azerbaijan. The warrant on Durov
                    was only valid if he was on French soil. As a result, TF1
                    reported that Durov traveled via the UAE, former Soviet
                    countries and South America to avoid arrest in Europe. He
                    also reportedly avoided traveling through countries where
                    Telegram is under surveillance.

                    flight just a stopover? In any case, he's in custody."

                    refused to comply with a court order to grant state security
                    services access to its users' encrypted messages. The action

                    Locking up merchandise at drugstores and discount retailers
                    hasn't curbed retail theft but is driving frustrated
                    consumers to shop online more, retail experts tell Axios.
                    Retail crime is eating into retailers' profits and high
                    theft rates are also leading to a rise in store closures.
                    Secured cases can cause sales to drop 15% to 25%, Joe
                    Budano, CEO of anti-theft technology company Indyme,
                    previously told Axios. Barricading everything from razors to
                    laundry detergent has largely backfired and broken shopping

                    Aisles full of locked plexiglass cases are common at many
                    CVS and Walgreens stores where consumers have to wait for an
                    employee to unlock them. Target, Walmart, Dollar General and
                    other retailers have also pulled back on self-checkout to
                    deter shoplifting. "Locking up products worsens the shopping
                    experience, and it makes things inconvenient and difficult,"
                    GlobalData retail analyst Neil Saunders said, adding it
                    pushes shoppers to other retailers or to move purchases
                    online.

                    Driving the news: Manmohan Mahajan, Walgreens global chief
                    financial officer, said in a June earnings call that the
                    retailer was experiencing "higher levels of shrink." Amazon
                    CEO Andy Jassy spoke of the "speed and ease" of ordering
                    online versus walking into pharmacies on a call with
                    investors last week. "It's a pretty tough experience with
                    how much is locked behind cabinets, where you have to press
                    a button to get somebody to come out and open the cabinets
                    for you," Jassy said.

                    The historical review and experiment may help solve a puzzle
                    that has fueled decades of debate in archaeology circles:
                    How did communities in North America actually use Clovis
                    points, which are among the most frequently unearthed items
                    from the Ice Age?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Clovis points are often the only recovered part of a
                    spear. The intricately designed bone shafts at the end of
                    the weapon are sometimes found, but the wood at the base of
                    the spear and the pine pitch and lacing that help make them
                    function as a complete system have been lost to time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Plus, research silos limit that kind of systems thinking
                    about prehistoric weaponry, Jun said. And if stone
                    specialists aren't experts in bone, they might not see the
                    full picture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "You have to look beyond the simple artifact," he said. "One
                    of the things that's key here is that we're looking at this
                    as an engineered system that requires multiple kinds of
                    sub-specialties within our field and other fields."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "People who are doing metal military artifact analysis
                    know all about it because it was used for stopping horses in
                    warfare," Byram said. "But prior to that, and in other
                    contexts with boar hunting or bear hunting, it wasn't very
                    well known. It's a theme that comes back in literature quite
                    a bit. But for whatever reason, it hasn't been talked about
                    too much in anthropology."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Sometimes in archaeology, the pieces just start
                    fitting together like they seem to now with Clovis
                    technology, and this puts pike hunting front and center with
                    extinct megafauna," Byram said. "It opens up a whole new way
                    of looking at how people lived among these incredible
                    animals during much of human history."

                    Although Boeing did not make an official statement Saturday
                    on its long-term plans for Starliner, NASA Administrator
                    Bill Nelson told reporters he received assurances from
                    Boeing's new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, that the company remains
                    committed to the commercial crew program. And it will take a
                    significant commitment from Boeing to see it through. Under
                    the terms of its fixed price contract with NASA, the company
                    is on the hook to pay for any expenses to fix the thruster
                    and helium leak problems and get Starliner flying again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Boeing has already reported $1.6 billion in charges on its
                    financial statements to pay for delays and cost overruns on
                    the Starliner program. That figure will grow as the company
                    will likely need to redesign some elements in the
                    spacecraft's propulsion system to remedy the problems
                    encountered on the Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission. NASA has
                    committed $5.1 billion to Boeing for the Starliner program,
                    and the agency has already paid out most of that funding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Boeing managers had previously declared Starliner was
                    safe enough to bring Wilmore and Williams home. Mark Nappi,
                    Boeing's Starliner program manager, regularly appeared to
                    downplay the seriousness of the thruster issues during press
                    conferences throughout Starliner's nearly three-month
                    mission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So why did NASA and Boeing engineers reach different
                    conclusions? "I think we're looking at the data and we view
                    the data and the uncertainty that's there differently than
                    Boeing does," said Jim Free, NASA's associate administrator,
                    and the agency's most senior civil servant. "It's not a
                    matter of trust. It's our technical expertise and our
                    experience that we have to balance. We balance risk across
                    everything, not just Starliner."

                    Across different cultures and countries, people perceive the
                    wisest people to be logical and reflective as well as able
                    to consider other people's feelings and perceptions.

                    What makes someone seem wise? People view wisdom through the
                    lens of applying knowledge and thinking logically as well as
                    considering others' feelings and perceptions, finds a new
                    study led by University of Waterloo researchers who looked
                    at perceptions of wisdom across 12 countries and five
                    continents.

                    Researchers examined the underlying principles guiding who
                    we perceive as wise in political leadership, science, and
                    daily life. Across different cultures, participants'
                    judgements converged on two dimensions: reflective
                    orientation and socio-emotional awareness. Reflective
                    orientation includes characteristics such as thinking
                    logically, emotion control and application of knowledge.
                    Socio-emotional awareness includes characteristics like care
                    for other's feelings and attention to social context.

                    "To our surprise, the two dimensions emerged across all
                    cultural regions we studied, and both were associated with
                    explicit attribution of wisdom," said Dr. Maksim Rudnev, a
                    postdoctoral research associate in psychology at Waterloo
                    and lead author.

                    The study suggests how people around the world might judge,
                    support and trust leaders, educators and others in positions
                    of influence. One example is how people view U.S. former
                    president Donald Trump and current president Joe Biden.

                Ben Hawkes over at Isoceles has a review of the
                <a href="https://blog.isosceles.com/openssh-backdoors/"
                  >two OpenSSH Backdoor attempts</a
                >. One, the XZ backdoor, was attempted this year in early 2024.
                The other, in 2002, was a matter of attempting to trojanize some
                distribution files.
              </p>

                <div>
                  <p>
                    Inserting an exploitable bug (a "bugdoor"), one that's
                    subtle enough that developers might not even notice during
                    code review, is probably the winning move. However, it's
                    interesting to note that in both 2002 and 2024 we got a
                    backdoor rather than a bugdoor. That's probably because
                    exploits are hard, and server-side exploits are really hard.
                    Given how much work it is to be in a position to change the
                    source code in the first place, it's not entirely surprising
                    that attackers want to go with a reliable option. The
                    counter-argument is that we may just never get to see any
                    bugdoors because they never get caught (or if they do, they
                    don't get flagged as subterfuge), so we're biased towards
                    the events that we can actually detect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are other similarities. Both the 2002 and 2024 events
                    targeted the build system, for example. This also makes
                    sense, because build systems are a perfect mix of
                    inscrutability and expressiveness. There's really no
                    constraints on what you can do with most build systems. They
                    have to be like this in order to make everything work
                    everywhere that it's supposed to. Making something compile
                    on Linux, MacOS, and Windows simultaneously is no easy feat.
                    Add in support for multiple architectures and legacy
                    versions, and well... you see where I'm going with this. The
                    guiding design principle for build systems has been "just
                    make it work", and so they end up being a complicated mess
                    of directives, rules, variables, and command invocations. As
                    long as they're working correctly, I suspect very few people
                    are paying close attention to the contents of their build
                    scripts, and that includes the developers/maintainers
                    themselves. It's the ideal place to insert the first hook
                    for a backdoor, hiding in plain sight.

                    with California lawmakers to fund local news in the state
                    after previously protesting a proposed law that would have
                    required it to pay media outlets. Under the terms of the
                    deal, Google will commit tens of millions of dollars to a
                    fund supporting local news as well as an AI “accelerator
                    program” in the state.

                  <p>
                    The agreement ends a months-long dispute between lawmakers
                    and Google over the California Journalism Preservation Act,
                    a bill that would have required Google, Meta and other large
                    platforms to pay California publishers in exchange for
                    linking to their websites. Google strongly opposed the
                    measure, which was similar to laws passed in Canada and
                    Australia.

                    The agreement also includes funding for a “National AI
                    Innovation Accelerator.” Details of that program are
                    unclear, but <em>Cal Matters</em>

                    and other organizations, including newsrooms. That aspect of
                    the deal, which is so far unique to Google's agreement in

                    certainly didn't think it was aliens. But he realized that
                    if the signals they were identifying had blazed brighter,
                    even momentarily, they would be very much like the Wow!
                    signal. As for the mechanism that caused such a brightening,
                    Mendez et al. propose that a

                    (a highly magnetic neutron star) passing behind a cloud of
                    atomic hydrogen could have flared up with sufficient energy
                    to produce

                    in the form of a tightly focused beam of microwave
                    radiation—a cosmic maser. (Masers are akin to lasers, except
                    they emit microwave radiation rather than visible
                    radiation.)

                    Proving their working hypothesis will be much more
                    challenging, although there have been rare sightings of such
                    naturally occurring masers from hydrogen molecules in space.
                    But nobody has ever spotted an atomic hydrogen cloud with an
                    associated maser, and that's what would be needed to explain
                    the intensity of the Wow! signal. That's why other
                    astronomers are opting for cautious skepticism. “A magnetar
                    is going to produce [short] radio emissions as well. Do you
                    really need this complicated maser stuff happening as well
                    to explain the Wow! signal?” Michael Garrett of the

                    and closes by saying, “SB 1047 is a highly reasonable bill
                    that asks large AI labs to do what they’ve already committed
                    to doing, namely, test their large models for catastrophic

                    Apple device users recently discovered a minor bug that
                    causes the Settings screen and home screen to crash. While
                    no serious issues have been reported so far, a fix in a
                    future firmware update would not be surprising.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Swiping right on the iOS home screen until the app library
                    appears, and then typing the characters "::" into the search
                    bar, causes Springboard – the software that handles the main
                    menu – to crash. A black screen with a loading icon briefly
                    appears before the device returns to the lock screen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, entering the same characters into the search
                    bar at the top of the Settings menu crashes the app,
                    immediately sending users back to the home screen. However,
                    the bug can be triggered by variations of this character
                    combination as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    >
                    that nearly any combination involving two quotation marks,
                    one colon, and any other character can trigger the same
                    effect. For example, typing "X":X also causes the issue.
                    TechSpot confirmed that the bug occurs on iPhones and iPads
                    running firmware version 17.6.1, but Macs remain unaffected.

                    TechCrunch that the issue doesn't pose a security threat.
                    However, the bug may raise some concerns because it
                    resembles more serious incidents from the past.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Fortunately, the recent iOS bug can only be triggered
                    by someone physically using the device, so the potential
                    risk remains limited.
