                    A groundbreaking cancer treatment developed by NUS
                    researchers utilizes engineered bacteria to deliver
                    chemotherapy drugs directly to tumor sites, significantly
                    enhancing treatment efficacy and reducing side effects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Traditional chemotherapy frequently presents substantial
                    difficulties, such as harsh side effects, harm to healthy
                    cells, and restricted effectiveness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National
                    University of Singapore (NUS Medicine), have pioneered a
                    groundbreaking cancer treatment method. This new technique
                    offers a more precise, potent, and less harmful alternative
                    to conventional chemotherapy. It not only enhances the
                    efficacy of the treatment but also substantially lowers the
                    dosage of drugs needed for cancer therapy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Prodrugs are inactive molecules that transform into
                    active drugs within the body, particularly in tumor
                    environments, by leveraging unique tumor conditions, such as
                    low oxygen or high acidity, to activate the drug precisely
                    at the cancer site, minimizing damage to healthy tissues.
                    However, current prodrug strategies exhibit limited target
                    specificity and frequently depend on macromolecular
                    carriers, which complicates both drug distribution and
                    clearance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To overcome these limitations, NUS Medicine researchers
                    developed a prodrug delivery method that utilizes a
                    commensal <em>Lactobacillus</em> strain that binds
                    specifically to cancer cells via a surface molecule called
                    heparan sulfate. These engineered bacteria carry a prodrug
                    that converts to the chemotherapy drug SN-38 at the tumor
                    site. In preclinical models of nasopharyngeal cancer, the
                    engineered bacteria localized specifically in the tumor and
                    released the chemotherapy drug directly at the cancer site,
                    reducing tumor growth by 67% and increasing the
                    effectiveness of the chemotherapy drug by 54%.

                    [...] “Cancer treatment often takes a tremendously heavy
                    toll on patients. Our research represents a significant step
                    toward developing a more targeted and less toxic approach to
                    fighting cancer. We hope this can pave the way for therapies
                    that are both mild and effective,” added A/Prof Chang,

                    Because the two versions of Google Pay were separate
                    codebases, Google didn't upgrade users from the old app to
                    the new app. They lived on the Play Store as separate apps,
                    both called "Google Pay," and for a while, it was possible
                    to download and install both apps on your device. A big use
                    case for the app was P2P payments, but money sent via the
                    new app didn't arrive on the old app, and vice versa, so for
                    months of the transition, Google Pay just wasn't a reliable
                    money-sending service that
                    <a href="https://x.com/RonAmadeo/status/1407131954521255940"
                      >normal people</a

                    could figure out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google often feels like a disorganized company with
                    constantly shifting priorities, and a big reason behind that
                    is the lack of top-down initiatives from the CEO. That means
                    the real driving force behind most projects at Google are
                    mid-level executives who show up with grand plans and then
                    leave—either in disgrace or triumph—when those initial plans
                    run their course. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Lost in all of this app shuffling is that Google
                    supposedly has no P2P payments system now. Wallet only
                    supports tap-to-pay, gift cards, and driver's licenses—it
                    doesn't have a way to send money to friends, family, or
                    anybody else. This worked fine on Google Pay before Google
                    blew everything up. Now, it is presumably ceding that market
                    to apps like Venmo and Zelle, though it's hard to imagine
                    anyone sticking with Google's payment app after the
                    confusing and broken transition.

                    "What is beautiful is that the stations' economic interest
                    is aligned with the grid—the [battery-swap companies] have
                    the incentive to time their charges during the low
                    utilization period, paying the low electricity price, while
                    feeding electricity back to the grid during peak period,
                    enjoying a higher price," says S. Alex Yang, a professor of

                    actually on the road powering scooters at any given time, so
                    the rest, sitting on the racks waiting for customers to pick

                    [...] The earthquake and its aftermath in Taiwan this year
                    put the VPP stations to the test—but also showed the
                    system's strength. On April 15, 12 days after the initial
                    earthquake, the grid in Taiwan was still recovering from the
                    damage when another power drop happened. This time, 818
                    Gogoro locations reacted in five seconds, reducing power
                    consumption by 11 megawatts for 30 minutes.

                    Numbers like 6 MW and 11 MW are "not a trivial amount of
                    power but still substantially smaller than a centralized
                    power plant," says Joshua Pearce, an engineering professor
                    at Western University in Ontario, Canada. For comparison,
                    Taiwan lost 3,200 MW of power supply right after the April
                    earthquake, and the gap was mostly filled by solar power,
                    centralized battery storage, and hydropower. But the entire
                    Taiwanese VPP network combined,

                      >which has reached a capacity of 1,350 MW</a
                    >, can make a significant difference. "It helps the grid
                    maintain stability during disasters. The more smart loads
                    there are on the grid, the more resilient it is," he says.

                    However, the potential of these battery-swap stations has
                    not been fully achieved yet; the majority of the stations
                    have not started giving energy back to the grid.

                    In most modern vehicles, these systems are “passive” in that
                    they don’t physically slow a speeding vehicle. A
                    notification may pop up if you’re going more than a few
                    miles per hour over the speed limit, but it won’t physically
                    limit your ability to speed. Active ISA systems will
                    physically slow your vehicle to keep you at the speed limit.
                    Some use tactile responses, like pushing the accelerator
                    back into your foot, while others actively limit the engine
                    power to keep you at the speed limit. These active systems
                    can be turned on and off by the driver.

                  <p>
                    [...] While conflicts around speed limiters are not new,
                    they have certainly become more deeply ingrained, thanks in
                    part to the covid-19 pandemic and political division.
                    According to Adkins, speeding got worse when everyone was
                    forced to stay home. “The people that were out, were
                    speeding, they were way more aggressive because they knew
                    they had the space, and they knew they could get away with
                    it,” he said.

                    [...] While Americans love the freedom to drive where they
                    want, as fast as they want, a study released today from the
                    Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows that consumers
                    may be more open to technology like ISA than previously
                    thought. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Ian Reagan, a senior research scientist at the
                    institute who designed the survey, more than 60 percent of
                    the 1,800 drivers who participated said they would be open
                    to some form of passive ISA system in new cars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even more surprising was that 50 percent of those surveyed
                    said they’d be open to active ISA, including tech that makes
                    the accelerator pedal harder to press or automatically
                    restricts speed. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety data
                    notes that drivers would have the option to turn any active
                    ISA system on and off as they see fit, making the technology
                    only useful if it’s accepted and utilized by drivers. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While this is a small bright spot when it comes to
                    potentially reducing speed-related accidents on US roads,
                    there is still a long way to go. After all, it took nearly
                    50 years of advocacy from groups like Mothers Against Drunk
                    Driving to stigmatize driving under the influence. And it
                    took nearly that long for drivers to get on board with
                    wearing their seatbelts. “I think we’ll get there,” Adkins
                    said, “but it’s going to take some time, and we have to do
                    this thoughtfully.”

                    that its researchers have worked closely with a team from
                    the University of Texas at Austin to create a prototype 3D
                    printer that is smaller than a coin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This photonic chip focuses its beam into a resin well that
                    rapidly cures when it’s hit by a particular wavelength of
                    light emitted from the chip. The palm-sized 3D printer also
                    saves space by eschewing moving parts — instead of using
                    arms and motors to change the beam’s focal point, the
                    prototype uses tiny optical antennas to move it around and
                    create the desired shape.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the team is successful in turning this concept into a
                    viable product, it could change the face of instant
                    manufacturing. The portability and speed of this palm-sized
                    printer could allow anyone — engineers, doctors, or even
                    first responders — to create solutions on the fly without
                    needing to lug around a big and heavy device.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These are just some of the exciting possibilities that
                    this 3D printing concept brings to the table. According to
                    MIT Professor Jelena Notaros, “This system is completely
                    rethinking what a 3D printer is. It is no longer a big box
                    sitting on a bench in a lab creating objects, but something
                    that is handheld and portable. It is exciting to think about
                    the new applications that could come out of this and how the
                    field of 3D printing could change.”

                    [....] The thin yet widespread layers of water frost were
                    discovered atop three of Mars' Tharsis volcanoes, located on
                    a plateau at the planet's equator, according to a new study

                    The Tharsis volcanoes, a string of 12 large peaks, are the
                    tallest volcanoes in our solar system, according to the
                    study, which notes that the water frost was discovered on
                    the volcanoes Olympus, Arsia Ascraeus Mons, and Ceraunius
                    Tholus.

                    "The researchers calculate the frost constitutes at least
                    150,000 tons of water that swaps between the surface and

                    Following the strongest solar storm in twenty years, NASA’s
                    ICESat-2 satellite was put into a safe hold on May 10 due to
                    atmospheric drag from the expanded atmosphere. Recovery
                    actions have since raised its orbit, with operations
                    anticipated to restart on June 17.

                  <p>
                    The lidar instrument on NASA’s ICESat-2 satellite is
                    scheduled to resume collecting data around June 17, after
                    going into a safe hold on May 10 due to impacts from the
                    strongest solar storm to hit Earth in two decades. The storm
                    did not cause any detectable damage to the satellite or its
                    instrument.

                    were released from the Sun and sparked a geomagnetic storm
                    at Earth that caused our planet’s atmosphere to expand in
                    places. This created unexpected drag on ICESat-2, rotating
                    the satellite, and triggering the satellite to enter safe
                    hold, which turned off ICESat-2’s science instrument.

                  <p>
                    The ICESat-2 team has conducted two thruster burns to raise
                    the spacecraft’s altitude, allowing it to now drift back to
                    its normal orbit around 310 miles (500 kilometers) above
                    Earth. Once there, the team will return the Advanced
                    Topographic Laser Altimeter System instrument to science
                    mode, to continue measuring the height of Earth’s ice,
                    water, forests, and land cover.

                    ICESat-2, short for Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation
                    Satellite-2, is a NASA satellite mission designed to measure
                    ice sheet elevation and sea ice thickness, as well as land
                    topography and vegetation characteristics. Launched in
                    September 2018, the satellite employs a sophisticated laser
                    altimeter system called ATLAS (Advanced Topographic Laser
                    Altimeter System) to provide precise and detailed
                    measurements of Earth’s surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ICESat-2’s high-resolution data helps scientists understand
                    changes in ice sheets, glaciers, and sea ice that result
                    from climate change, enhancing our ability to accurately
                    predict future sea level rise and assess changes in Earth’s
                    ecosystems. This satellite is a critical tool in NASA’s
                    Earth Observing System, contributing valuable data for
                    environmental research and climate science.

                    Unfortunately for big ISPs, legal history hasn’t been in
                    their favor. This particular debate has wound through the
                    legal system several times now, and each time the courts
                    have ruled that the FCC has the legal right to reclassify
                    broadband and impose net neutrality under the Telecom Act —
                    provided they provide hard data supporting their decisions.

                    Even if telecom giants like AT&amp;T land a corrupted judge
                    willing to overlook all functional legal precedent and

                    oversight of corporate America, bogging down absolutely any
                    federal reform effort down in a perpetual legal quagmire.
                    The stakes of that across labor, consumer protection, public

                    that requires users to sign in via facial recognition,
                    fingerprint, or a PIN.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That same authentication will be required for a user to
                    access or search through their Recall history timeline as
                    well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Plus, Microsoft says it's "adding additional layers of data
                    protection." Recall snapshots will only be decrypted and
                    accessible after a user authenticates. The search index
                    database will also now be encrypted too.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft's blog post about the Recall security update also
                    runs through a number of security-related provisions that
                    were already built in, such as the screenshots only being
                    available locally on the device. The feature already
                    provided imagery to show it was being used – a Recall icon
                    pinned to the taskbar on a user's desktop. However, many
                    users would've likely been unaware of what the icon meant if
                    Recall had just been on as a default.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new opt-in option should hopefully make it crystal clear
                    that a user is consenting to what Recall does.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    Someone recently asked an interesting question: Why do
                    Microsoft C and compatible DOS compilers have no truncate()
                    and/or ftruncate() library functions? And how does one
                    resize files on DOS?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    OK, that's actually two questions. The first one is easy
                    enough to answer: Because XENIX had no truncate() or
                    ftruncate() either. Instead, XENIX had a chsize() function
                    which, sure enough, can be found in the Microsoft C
                    libraries at least as far back as MS C 3.0 (early 1985).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second question is rather more interesting. The way
                    files are resized on DOS is moving the file pointer to the
                    desired size by calling the LSEEK function (INT 21h/42h),
                    and then calling the WRITE function (INT 21h/40h) with zero
                    length (CX=0).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, this mechanism is rather curious, because the
                    handle-based file API in DOS 2.0 was modeled on XENIX, yet
                    on UNIX systems, the write() function asked to transfer zero
                    bytes simply does nothing. If the mechanism didn't come from
                    XENIX, where did it come from?....
                  </p>

                    For the new study, a team of international researchers used
                    an artificial intelligence algorithm to analyse the calls of
                    two wild herds of African savannah elephants in Kenya.

                    The research "not only shows that elephants use specific
                    vocalisations for each individual, but that they recognise
                    and react to a call addressed to them while ignoring those
                    addressed to others," lead study author Michael Pardo said.

                    The researchers analyzed vocalizations - mostly rumbles
                    generated by elephants using their vocal cords, similar to
                    how people speak - made by more than 100 elephants in

                    identifying a specific elephant as the intended addressee.
                    The researchers then played audio for 17 elephants to test
                    how they would respond to a call apparently addressed to
                    them as well as to a call apparently addressed to some other

                    Air ambulances and emergency response vehicles carry O

                  <p>
                    Just 8% of the population have type O negative but it makes
                    up for around 15% of hospital orders.

                    O-positive is the most common blood type, 35% of donors have
                    it, and it can be given to anybody with any positive blood
                    type. This means three in every four people, or 76% of the
                    population, can benefit from an O positive donation.

                    This National Blood Week it has been revealed that three
                    blood donations are needed every minute in hospitals and
                    there are about 13,000 appointments available nationally
                    this week in NHS Blood Donor Centres with 3,400 available in
                    London.

                It's time to get these systems off the internet or to secure
                them properly. Why is that so hard to understand?

                A very interesting article about programming Robots, written by
                BENJIE HOLSON:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    I worked on this idea for months before I decided it was a
                    mistake. The second time I heard someone mention it, I
                    thought, "That's strange, these two groups had the same
                    idea. Maybe I should tell them it didn't work for us." The
                    third and fourth time I rolled my eyes and ignored it. The
                    fifth time I heard about a group struggling with this
                    mistake I decided it was worth a blog post all on its own. I
                    call this idea "The Mythical Non-Roboticist".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea goes something like this: Programming robots is
                    hard. And there are some people with really arcane skills
                    and PhDs who are really expensive and seem to be required
                    for some reason. Wouldn't it be nice if we could do robotics
                    without them?1 What if everyone could do robotics? That
                    would be great, right? We should make a software framework
                    so that non-roboticists can program robots.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This idea is so close to a correct idea that it's hard to
                    tell why it doesn't work out. On the surface, it's not
                    wrong: all else being equal, it would be good if programming
                    robots was more accessible. The problem is that we don't
                    have a good recipe for making working robots. So we don't
                    know how to make that recipe easier to follow. In order to
                    make things simple, people end up removing things that folks
                    might need, because no one knows for sure what's absolutely
                    required. It's like saying you want to invent an
                    invisibility cloak and want to be able to make it from
                    materials you can buy from Home Depot. Sure, that would be
                    nice, but if you invented an invisibility cloak that
                    required some mercury and neodymium to manufacture would you
                    toss the recipe?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In robotics, this mistake is based on a very true and very
                    real observation: programming robots is super hard. Famously
                    hard. It would be super-great if programming robots was
                    easier. The issue is this: programming robots has two
                    different kinds of hard parts.

                    [...] As with the earlier find, there seem to be two
                    possible explanations for the ASKAP source. One is a neutron
                    star that's still managing to emit radiofrequency radiation
                    from its poles despite rotating extremely slowly. The second
                    is a white dwarf that has a reasonable rotation period but
                    an unreasonably strong magnetic field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To get at this issue, the researchers estimate the strength
                    of the magnetic field needed to produce the larger bursts
                    and come up with a value that's significantly higher than
                    any previously observed to originate on a white dwarf. So
                    they strongly argue for the source being a neutron star.
                    Whether that argues for the earlier source being a neutron
                    star will depend on whether you feel that the two objects
                    represent a single phenomenon despite their somewhat
                    different behaviors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In any case, we now have two of these mystery slow-repeat
                    objects to explain. It's possible that we'll be able to
                    learn more about this newer one if we can get some
                    information as to what's involved in its mode switching. But
                    then we'll have to figure out if what we learn applies to
                    the one we discovered earlier.

                    PerSourcePenalties will be enabled by default, and admins

                    Microsoft is revamping how Recall works amid its PR

                  <p>
                            -Microsoft promised groundbreaking features with
                    Copilot+, including Cocreator and Live Captions, but Recall
                    has become a PR nightmare.<br />
                            -Concerns about Recall being a security risk have
                    led to backlash and panic among users due to data access
                    vulnerabilities.<br />
                            -Microsoft has been silent on Recall issues but is
                    finally taking action to address the security concerns and
                    ensure user control.

                    One of the key complaints about Recall is that it was
                    opt-out. In the setup experience, Windows just tells you
                    that it's on, and lets you check a box to open settings
                    after setup is complete. Now, you'll have to choose to turn
                    it on during the out-of-box experience, so it's totally
                    opt-in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Secondly, you'll have to use Windows Hello in order to turn
                    on Recall. The idea is that in order to access it, Windows
                    will have to know it's you.<br />
                      Finally, Windows is going to use just-in-time decryption,
                    meaning everything will be encrypted until you've been
                    authenticated. Microsoft also confirmed that it's encrypted
                    the search index database, which was one of the key
                    call-outs in the report from earlier this week.

                    Microsoft also noted that all Copilot+ PCs are Secured-core,
                    so they're designed to be secure. They have Microsoft Pluton
                    security chips, so there's hardware-level protection going
                    on there.<br />

                And, all of this makes sense because we know that security chips
                can't be hacked, because they are secure chips, right? /sarcasm

                Oh yeah, the data never leaves your PC. Unless, of course, you
                do a backup to the cloud, right? In which case your data may be
                in Sri Lanka, Timbuktu, Israel, or, maybe even Ireland. And,
                police forces in third world banana republics never get warrants

                The best thing Microsoft can do with CoPilot, is to deep six it.
                Better yet, deep six all of their "telemetry" along with
                CoPilot.

                I tried it on a 10 year old car and it pretty much matched what
                I expected -- no Wi-Fi, no linking to phones, but possible data

                    Of all the data that car companies can potentially capture,
                    one of the most eye-opening from the Mozilla report was
                    people having sex in vehicles. "One of the things that
                    everybody latched onto was Nissan and Kia saying they could
                    collect information on your sex life or your sexual
                    activity," Caltrider said. "That really freaked people out."
                    While the researchers couldn't determine exactly how the
                    automakers would gather data on sexual activity in cars, the
                    educated guess is it wouldn't be that hard for cameras and
                    sensors to gather the information necessary.

                  <p>
                    After the Mozilla Foundation report was released, Kia
                    Connect Services (a suite of services Kia extends to its
                    vehicle owners) and Nissan USA removed wording about
                    collecting information on sexual activity from their online
                    privacy policies, Caltrider said. She sent us a PDF of the
                    original wording on the Nissan site, and under Types of
                    Personal Data collected, it read: "Sensitive personal
                    information, including ... sexual orientation, sexual
                    activity, precise geolocation, health diagnosis data, and
                    genetic information." On Kia's broader corporate privacy
                    page under Sensitive Personal Information as of press time,
                    it still read, "This category may include ... sex life or
                    sexual orientation information."

                Historically, high-speed rail travel by
                <i>Train a Grande Vitesse</i> (TGV) in France was the monopoly

                Trentalia, a unit of Italy's state rail operator, decided to

                It might be noteworthy that earlier this year, the EU decided to
                speed-up the implementation of the TEN-T network. The TEN-T is
                an EU-wide network of rail, inland waterways, short-sea shipping
                routes, and roads. It connects 424 major cities with ports,
                airports and railway terminals. When the TEN-T is complete, it
                will cut travel times between these cities. For example,
                passengers will be able to travel between Copenhagen and Hamburg
                in 2.5 hours by train, instead of the 4.5 hours required today.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    During an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,
                    comedian Larry David explained that his New Year's
                    Resolution was "make two trips" (episode 857, January 8,
                    2020).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, when carrying groceries into the house, it is
                    tempting to carry everything at once, but then you drop the
                    cantaloupe, and now you have to clean up that mess. While it
                    seemed like one trip would have been faster, if you include
                    the time it takes to clean up the mess, it would have been
                    faster to simply make two trips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This "make two trips" strategy isn't an
                    earth-shattering breakthrough. It won't cure cancer, end
                    world hunger, or fix the climate crisis. However, I have
                    adopted this philosophy, and it has had many benefits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The immediate benefit is that I am now more likely to have a
                    free hand to open my house door. Pulling keys out of my
                    pocket no longer involves smashing a grocery bag between my
                    chest and the house.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The larger benefit has come from adopting this philosophy in
                    both coding and operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The other day, I was adding a feature to some old code. The
                    code reported results of an earlier calculation with various
                    formatting options that could be enabled or disabled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The code was quite complex because certain options affected
                    the format in ways that had downstream implications for
                    other options. The code was able to satisfy all the various
                    options and controls in one pass over the data, printing a
                    report along the way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I struggled in earnest to add my new feature to this
                    ever-growing complicated loop.
                  </p>
                  <p>Then I remembered Larry's advice: Make two trips.</p>
                  <p>
                    The code would be significantly simpler if it made two
                    passes over the data. One pass would collect data, count
                    things that needed to be counted, sum subtotals, and so on.
                    The second pass would take all this information and output
                    the report, and would be much easier because it had all the
                    information it needed from the start. No Schrödinger's cat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It was a classic complexity vs. memory engineering
                    decision: Suffer from complexity or suffer from potential
                    memory exhaustion.

                    social sciences (HSS) and 81 in science, technology,
                    engineering, art/design, and mathematics (STEAM). The data

                    are used 3.75 times more and receive 21 percent more
                    citations than their paywalled counterparts. Open-access

                    15 percent more citations than their non-open counterparts,

                    Programming style is not a matter of efficiency in a

                    else, how easy it is to figure out what the program does a
                    year after you've written it; and above all, style is a
                    matter of taste, of aesthetics, of what you think looks
                    nice, of what you think is elegant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although style is mainly a matter of taste, a programmer
                    with a "good" style will find his programs easy to write,
                    easy to read, and easy to explain to others. ...

                  <p>
                    In particular, you may have acquired special programming
                    tricks that you are very fond of, and that aren't used by
                    other programmers, but that don't make your programs much
                    more efficient. I urge you to stop using those tricks. As
                    Samuel Johnson once said, "Read over your compositions, and
                    when you meet with a passage which you think is particularly
                    fine, strike it out."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In other words, make your style simple, not complicated,
                    even though the complicated style may seem to have some
                    abstract virtues. ...

                When teaching an algorithms course, Craig Partridge, of Colorado
                State University, discovered that his students had little to no
                idea of how to divide their code into functions. So he wrote a

                So contestants from all over the world can gather and compete
                for the title of "Miss AI".
              </p>
              <p>
                Excerpt from RT:<br />------------------<br />The event, called
                'Miss AI', is being organized by the World AI Creator Awards
                (WAICA) in collaboration with Fanvue – an OnlyFans-like
                subscription-based platform that already hosts a number of
                virtual models, including those who offer adult content.
              </p>
              <p>
                The digital contestants hoping to secure the Miss AI crown will
                be judged on their beauty, underlying tech, as well as their
                social media pull, according to WAICA's official website. The AI
                creator's "social media clout" will also be assessed based on
                their engagement numbers with fans, rate of audience growth, and
                ability to utilize social media platforms such as Instagram.<br />---------------------

                I don't quite know what to make of this. There are so many
                viewpoints and I hope to see what others feel about it. One
                thing, it's an inevitable outcome of combining our technology
                and artistic expression, even done on ancient cave walls. Soon
                our digital presence can be tailored to anything we want it to
                be. Work from home. Zoom calls ( with your AI proxy, of course,
                which would handle as many simultaneous interactions as your
                server technology can handle ).

                    The Devcore writeup said that the researchers have confirmed
                    that XAMPP is vulnerable when Windows is configured to use
                    the locales for Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, or
                    Japanese. In Windows, a locale is a set of user preference
                    information related to the user's language, environment,
                    and/or cultural conventions. The researchers haven't tested
                    other locales and have urged people using them to perform a
                    comprehensive asset assessment to test their usage
                    scenarios.

                    ransomware-as-a-service to a global network of ‘affiliates’,
                    giving criminals tools to carry out their own cyberattacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In February, the joint operation managed to take down
                    LockBit’s data leak website and managed to uncover a large
                    amount of data about the gang and its activities.
                    Authorities also seized the decryption keys that the FBI is
                    now offering to victims.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a recent statement, the FBI’s cyber assistant director
                    Bryan Vorndran claimed LockBit was the most deployed
                    ransomware variant in the world by 2022 and that the gang
                    has caused “billions of dollars in damages to victims”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “We are reaching out to known LockBit victims and
                    encouraging anyone who suspects they were a victim to visit
                    our Internet Crime Complaint Center,” Vorndran said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Raj Samani, SVP and chief scientist at Rapid7, said
                    the release of these decryption keys is “another kick in the
                    teeth” for the LockBit gang and “a great win for law
                    enforcement”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The likes of LockBit survive and thrive on victims paying
                    ransom demands, therefore, it’s great to see the US
                    government be proactive and prevent this by releasing the
                    decryption keys for free,” Samani said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Ever since law enforcement took down LockBit’s
                    infrastructure in February 2024, they’ve engaged in PR and
                    damage control in order to show strength and maintain the
                    confidence of affiliates. However, such announcements by the
                    FBI damages this confidence, and hopefully we’ll soon see
                    the end of the LockBit ransomware group.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not everyone is so optimistic however. Ricardo Villadiego,
                    the founder and CEO of cybersecurity firm Lumu, told
                    SiliconRepublic.com recently that gangs such as LockBit are

                    services again in “less than four days”.

                    While most algorithms operate near perfectly on their own,
                    Peter Grantcharov explains that the OR black box is still
                    not fully autonomous. For example, it's difficult to capture
                    audio through ceiling mikes and thus get a reliable
                    transcript to document whether every element of the surgical
                    safety checklist was completed; he estimates that this
                    algorithm has a 15% error rate. So before the output from
                    each procedure is finalized, one of the Toronto analysts
                    manually verifies adherence to the questionnaire. "It will
                    require a human in the loop," Peter Grantcharov says, but he
                    gauges that the AI model has made the process of confirming
                    checklist compliance 80% to 90% more efficient. He also
                    emphasizes that the models are constantly being improved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In all, the OR black box can cost about $100,000 to install,
                    and analytics expenses run $25,000 annually, according to
                    Janet Donovan, an OR nurse who shared with
                    <em>MIT Technology Review</em> an estimate given to staff at
                    Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital in Massachusetts.
                    (Peter Grantcharov declined to comment on these numbers,
                    writing in an email: "We don't share specific pricing;
                    however, we can say that it's based on the product mix and
                    the total number of rooms, with inherent volume-based
                    discounting built into our pricing models.")

                  <p>
                    [...] At some level, the identity protections are only half
                    measures. Before 30-day-old recordings are automatically
                    deleted, Grantcharov acknowledges, hospital administrators
                    can still see the OR number, the time of operation, and the
                    patient's medical record number, so even if OR personnel are
                    technically de-identified, they aren't truly anonymous. The
                    result is a sense that "Big Brother is watching," says
                    Christopher Mantyh, vice chair of clinical operations at
                    Duke University Hospital, which has black boxes in seven
                    ORs. He will draw on aggregate data to talk generally about
                    quality improvement at departmental meetings, but when
                    specific issues arise, like breaks in sterility or a cluster
                    of infections, he will look to the recordings and "go to the
                    surgeons directly."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In many ways, that's what worries Donovan, the Faulkner
                    Hospital nurse. She's not convinced the hospital will
                    protect staff members' identities and is worried that these
                    recordings will be used against them—whether through
                    internal disciplinary actions or in a patient's malpractice
                    suit. In February 2023, she and almost 60 others sent a
                    letter to the hospital's chief of surgery objecting to the
                    black box. She's since filed a grievance with the state,
                    with arbitration proceedings scheduled for October.

                    release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But despite transformative
                    effects on companies’ share prices, generative AI tools
                    powered by large language models (LLMs) still have major
                    drawbacks that have kept them from being as useful as many
                    would like them to be. Retrieval augmented generation, or

                    gap-filling phenomenon AI language models produce when they
                    are tasked with reproducing knowledge that wasn’t present in
                    the training data. They generate plausible-sounding text
                    that can veer toward accuracy when the training data is
                    solid but otherwise may just be completely made up.

                    on its first public demonstration back in February 2023
                    about the James Webb Space Telescope. The error wiped around
                    $100 billion off the value of parent company Alphabet. LLMs
                    produce the most statistically likely response based on
                    their training data and don’t understand anything they
                    output, meaning they can present false information that
                    seems accurate if you don't have expert knowledge on a
                    subject.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    LLMs also lack up-to-date knowledge and the ability to
                    identify gaps in their knowledge. “When a human tries to
                    answer a question, they can rely on their memory and come up
                    with a response on the fly, or they could do something like
                    Google it or peruse Wikipedia and then try to piece an
                    answer together from what they find there—still filtering
                    that info through their internal knowledge of the matter,”
                    said Giansiracusa.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But LLMs aren’t humans, of course. Their training data can
                    age quickly, particularly in more time-sensitive queries. In
                    addition, the LLM often can’t distinguish specific sources
                    of its knowledge, as all its training data is blended
                    together into a kind of soup.

                    In theory, RAG should make keeping AI models up to date far
                    cheaper and easier. “The beauty of RAG is that when new
                    information becomes available, rather than having to retrain
                    the model, all that’s needed is to augment the model’s
                    external knowledge base with the updated information,” said
                    Peterson. “This reduces LLM development time and cost while
                    enhancing the model’s scalability.”

                    MDMA, sometimes called Molly or ecstasy, has been banned in
                    the United States for more than three decades. Now this
                    potent mind-altering drug is poised to become a badly needed
                    therapy for PTSD.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On June 4, the Food and Drug Administration's advisory
                    committee will meet to discuss the risks and benefits of
                    MDMA therapy. If the committee votes in favor of the drug,
                    it could be approved to treat PTSD this summer. The approval
                    would represent a momentous achievement for proponents of
                    mind-altering drugs, who have been working toward this goal
                    for decades. And it could help pave the way for FDA approval
                    of other illicit drugs like psilocybin. But the details
                    surrounding how these compounds will make the transition
                    from illicit substances to legitimate therapies are still
                    foggy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, for drugs that carry a risk of serious side
                    effects, the FDA can add a risk evaluation and mitigation
                    strategy to its approval. For MDMA that might include
                    mandating that the health-care professionals who administer
                    the medication have certain certifications or specialized
                    training, or requiring that the drug be dispensed only in
                    licensed facilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, Spravato, a nasal spray approved in 2019 for
                    depression that works much like ketamine, is available only
                    at a limited number of health-care facilities and must be
                    taken under the observation of a health-care provider.
                    Having safeguards in place for MDMA makes sense, at least at
                    the outset, says Matt Lamkin, an associate professor at the
                    University of Tulsa College of Law who has been following
                    the field closely.: "Given the history, I think it would
                    only take a couple of high-profile bad incidents to
                    potentially set things back."

                    What mind-altering drug is next in line for FDA approval?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Psilocybin, a.k.a. the active ingredient in magic mushrooms.
                    This summer Compass Pathways will release the first results
                    from one of its phase 3 trials of psilocybin to treat
                    depression. Results from the other trial will come in the
                    middle of 2025, which—if all goes well—puts the company on
                    track to file for approval in the fall or winter of next
                    year. With the FDA review and the DEA rescheduling, "it's
                    still kind of two to three years out," Nath says.

                    Some states are moving ahead without formal approval. Oregon
                    voters made psilocybin legal in 2020, and the drug is

                    there at about 20 licensed centers for supervised use. "It's
                    an adult use program that has a therapeutic element," says
                    Ismail Ali, director of policy and advocacy at the
                    Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies
                    (MAPS).

                    While initially this looked like good news, almost three
                    months later, this has turned into a complete and utter
                    disaster.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the past months, the Linux Kernel team has issued
                    thousands of CVE identifiers, with the vast majority being
                    for trivial bug fixes and not just security flaws.

                    We say weird because they are quite unique among all CNAs.
                    The Linux kernel team argues that because of the deep layer
                    where the kernel runs, bugs are hard to understand, and
                    there is always a possibility of them becoming a security
                    issue later down the line. Direct quote below:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        "Note, due to the layer at which the Linux kernel is in
                        a system, almost any bug might be exploitable to
                        compromise the security of the kernel, but the
                        possibility of exploitation is often not evident when
                        the bug is fixed. Because of this, the CVE assignment
                        team is overly cautious and assign CVE numbers to any
                        bugfix that they identify. This explains the seemingly
                        large number of CVEs that are issued by the Linux kernel
                        team."
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    [...] Instead, the Linux Kernel team appears to have adopted
                    a simpler approach where it puts a CVE on everything and
                    lets the software and infosec community at large confirm
                    that an issue is an authentic security flaw. If it's not,
                    it's on the security and vulnerability management firms to
                    file CVE revocation requests with the precise Linux Kernel
                    team that runs the affected component.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new Linux CNA rules also prohibit the issuance of CVEs
                    for bugs in EOL Linux kernels, which is also another weird
                    take on security. Just because you don't maintain the code
                    anymore, that doesn't mean attackers won't exploit it and
                    that people wouldn't want to track it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Linux team will also refuse to assign CVEs until a patch
                    has been deployed, meaning there will be no CVEs for
                    zero-days or vulnerabilities that may require a longer
                    reporting and patching timeline.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And if this isn't bad enough, the Linux kernel team

                  <p>
                    [...] Unfortunately, all of this CVE spam also could have

                    In a burnished-oak corridor outside the committee room at
                    IBM's headquarters in August 1980, two engineers pace
                    nervously. Eventually, a door opens. Their boss, Bill Lowe,
                    emerges from the board room next door. Before they can say
                    anything, he smiles and nods. They laugh. They can't quite
                    believe it. It's official. IBM is going to try and build a
                    home computer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bill Lowe kicked off this ambitious project, but he wouldn't
                    be the person who would finish it. That role would fall to
                    his successor, a humble, cowboy boot-wearing mid-level
                    executive, out of favor and kicking his heels in the IBM
                    corporate backwater of Boca Raton, Florida. He would take
                    Lowe's project forward, one nobody else in the company
                    wanted. Just 12 months later, on August 15, 1981, a computer
                    would launch that would change the world: the IBM PC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is the story of Don Estridge, the man who brought the
                    IBM PC to market and changed business and home computing
                    forever. In just five years he created an IBM division that
                    almost nobody else in the company wanted to exist. By 1983,
                    it had seized 70 percent of the microcomputer market and was
                    valued at over $4 billion ($12 billion today). Under
                    Estridge, IBM's PC division sold over 1 million machines a
                    year, making it the third largest computer manufacturer in
                    the world on its own. This story is based on contemporary
                    accounts in publications such as InfoWorld, PC magazine,
                    Time, and the New York Times, as well as books such as Blue
                    Magic by James Chposky and Ted Leonsis; Big Blues by Paul
                    Carroll; and Fire in the Valley by Michael Swaine and Paul
                    Frieberger.

                    A study carried out by the University of Helsinki's DogRisk
                    research group, the University of Eastern Finland and Wise
                    Nose – Scent Discrimination Association in Finland
                    investigated the threshold for scent detection in dogs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study revealed that dogs can learn to identify
                    concentrations of eucalyptus hydrolate that are clearly
                    below the detection threshold of sophisticated analytical
                    instruments used today. The concentrations were also far
                    below previously reported levels. Dogs' extraordinary sense
                    of smell can be exploited, for example, in search and rescue
                    operations and in medical detection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 15 dogs that participated in the study had different
                    training backgrounds. Some dogs had experience of nose work,
                    which is a hobby and competitive dog sport, while some had
                    been trained to identify diseases, mould or pests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the study, the dogs were to differentiate samples
                    containing low concentrations of eucalyptus hydrolate from
                    samples containing only water. The focus was on determining
                    the lowest concentration that the dogs could detect for
                    certain. The study included three different tests where the
                    concentrations of the hydrolate were diluted gradually until
                    the dogs could no longer identify the scent. This determined
                    the threshold for their scent detection ability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The dogs' scent detection threshold initially varied from
                    1:10⁴–1:10²³ but narrowed down to 1:10¹⁷–1:10²¹ after a
                    training period. In other words, the dogs needed 1 to 10
                    molecules per millilitre of water to detect the right
                    sample. For perspective, a single yeast cell contains 42
                    million molecules," describes the principal investigator of
                    the study, Anna Hielm-Björkman from the University of
                    Helsinki.

                    young people are going to want to try it."<br />...<br />Kâipa
                    Marubo, a father of three, said he was concerned about his
                    children playing first-person shooter video games, fearing
                    they might want to mimic the attacks.

                    Another leader, Enoque Marubo, 40, said the tribe has
                    started limiting the hours members could access the internet
                    because its introduction had "changed the routine so much
                    that it was detrimental".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Members can browse the internet for two hours in the morning
                    and five hours in the afternoon and all day on Sundays.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In the village, if you don't hunt, fish and plant, you
                    don't eat," Enoque said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Enoque worked with Brazilian activist Flora Dutra to bring
                    the internet to the tribe.

                    They contacted American philanthropist Allyson Reneau, who
                    reportedly donated 20 Starlink units to the Marubo tribe.

                    The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission
                    have reached a deal that clears the way for potential
                    antitrust investigations into the dominant roles that
                    Microsoft (MSFT.O), OpenAI and Nvidia (NVDA.O) , play in the
                    artificial intelligence industry, according to a source
                    familiar with the matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The agreement between the two agencies shows regulatory
                    scrutiny is gathering steam amid concerns over concentration
                    in the industries that make up AI. Microsoft and Nvidia not
                    only dominate their industries but are also the world's two
                    biggest companies by market capitalization.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The move to divvy up the industry mirrors a similar
                    agreement between the two agencies in 2019 to divide
                    enforcement against Big Tech, which ultimately saw the FTC
                    bring cases against Meta (META.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O), and
                    the DOJ sue Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) for alleged
                    violations. Those cases are ongoing and the companies have
                    denied wrongdoing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While OpenAI's parent is a nonprofit, Microsoft has invested
                    $13 billion in a for-profit subsidiary, for what would be a
                    49% stake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Justice Department will take the lead in investigating
                    whether Nvidia violated antitrust laws, while the FTC will
                    examine the conduct of OpenAI and Microsoft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The regulators struck the deal over the past week, and it is
                    expected to be completed in the coming days, the person
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nvidia has roughly 80% of the AI chip market, including the
                    custom AI processors made by the cloud computing companies
                    like Google, Microsoft and Amazon.com. That domination helps
                    the company report gross margins between 70% and 80%.

                    A multi-institutional team of plant specialists,
                    microbiologists and paleontologists in the Czech Republic
                    and the University of Minnesota, in the U.S., has found
                    evidence of a hot spring oasis during the last ice age in a
                    part of central Europe.
                  </p>

                    <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ado6611"
                      >study</a
                    >, reported in the journal <i>Science Advances</i>, the
                    group found and analyzed bits of leaves, wood and pollen in
                    the area around a modern freshwater spring.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Environmental scientists have long suggested that temporary
                    hot springs in parts of Europe may have helped trees and
                    other types of plants survive during the last ice age, but
                    there has been little evidence to prove the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this new effort, the research team ventured to freshwater
                    springs in the Vienna Basin looking for evidence of ancient
                    plant life. They suspected an oasis could have existed in
                    the area during the last ice age, as the weight of glaciers
                    sliding down the nearby Alps set off tectonic activity,
                    releasing geothermally heated water from deep within the
                    Earth's crust.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The release of warm water, the researchers reasoned, would
                    have formed an oasis, keeping the ground around the hot
                    springs warm enough for trees and other plants to survive
                    even though they would have been surrounded by ice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During their search, the research team found bits of wood,
                    pollen and fossilized bits of leaves from trees that should
                    not have been able to survive in the area during the last
                    ice—yet, they were dated to between 19,000 and 26,000 years
                    ago, a span of time that correlated to the last ice age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The findings strongly support the presence of an oasis
                    during the last ice age—one that helped some types of trees
                    survive despite the cold.

                Shuffling a set means randomly choosing an ordered sequence of
                its elements.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, shuffling {A,B,C} means choosing with equal
                probability one of 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 permutations: ABC, ACB,
                BAC, BCA, CAB, or CBA.

                Which programming problems did you encounter which looked easy,
                but were really a front for a Gordian Knot of subtle details --

                    When you think about games written for the Atari Video
                    Computer System (or 2600) today, what do you picture? Likely
                    a home version of an arcade game, or some kind of shooter, a
                    maze game, something that takes place entirely on a single
                    screen. This is not the entirety of the 2600 library, though
                    – major releases such as
                    <i>Pitfall!, Adventure, E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial</i>, or
                    <i>Smurfs: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle</i> were built around
                    worlds that extended beyond the screen's borders, where you
                    didn't necessarily know what was coming next or how you'd
                    need to approach that challenge. And among the most
                    ambitious of these titles announced was <i>Tarzan</i>, to be
                    published by Coleco for the 2600 and the ColecoVision
                    console in 1984.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <i>Tarzan</i> was initially announced for as a 1983
                    ColecoVision release at the 1983 Winter Consumer Electronics
                    Show, held in Las Vegas, with a 2600 port announced later
                    that year during the summer CES for a November release.
                    These dates slipped, with the ColecoVision
                    <i>Tarzan</i> finally shipping in August, and the 2600 game
                    announced as a second quarter release before being quietly
                    canceled. The released ColecoVision version was fairly
                    well-reviewed, with the newsletter
                    <i>Computer Entertainer</i> praising the graphics and the
                    varied action, noting strategy is required to clear the
                    game. But the 2600 version faded into obscurity, considered
                    just another project canceled due to the 1983 North American
                    market collapse and its yearslong aftermath. In 2011 a
                    manual for the game turned up, but the game itself remained
                    lost. Lost, that is, until collector Rob "AtariSpot" managed
                    to purchase a working copy of the game off of a former
                    Coleco employee in 2022 and successfully worked with
                    longtime Atari homebrew programmer Thomas Jentzsch to get it
                    dumped. All 2600 games bigger than 4 kilobytes in size
                    utilize an approach called "bankswitching" to get around
                    hardware limitations by inserting code that gets the console
                    to look at a separate 4-kilobyte chunk of data. This allowed
                    for larger and more complex game programs, and
                    <i>Tarzan</i>, a 12-kilobyte cartridge, is no exception. The
                    game uses a unique bankswitching scheme, but Jentzsch was
                    able to modify it into a standard "F6" bankswitch to make it
                    operable on emulators and flash carts. Both versions are

                            On Sunday, three C-47 transport planes, a workhorse
                            of the war, dropped three long strings of jumpers,
                            their round chutes mushrooming open in the blue
                            skies with puffy white clouds, to whoops from the
                            huge crowd that was regaled by tunes from Glenn
                            Miller and Edith Piaf as they waited.

                    Adult content has always proliferated on Twitter, but the
                    platform now called X recently clarified its
                    <a
                      href="https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/adult-content"

                    to officially allow "consensually produced and distributed
                    adult nudity or sexual behavior."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    X's rules seem simple. As long as content is "properly
                    labeled and not prominently displayed," users can share
                    material—including AI-generated or animated content—"that is
                    pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We believe that users should be able to create, distribute,
                    and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it
                    is consensually produced and distributed," X's policy said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The policy update seemingly reflects X's core mission to
                    defend all legal speech. It protects a wide range of sexual
                    expression, including depictions of explicit or implicit
                    sexual behavior, simulated sexual intercourse, full or
                    partial nudity, and close-ups of genitals, buttocks, or
                    breasts.
                  </p>
                  <p>[....] none of this content can be monetized</p>

                  <p>
                    [....] now requires content warnings so that "users who do
                    not wish to see it can avoid it" and "children below the age

                    The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is pleased to announce

                      >FreeBSD 14.1-RELEASE.</a
                    >
                    This is the second release of the stable/14 branch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    FreeBSD 14.1-RELEASE is now available for the amd64, i386,
                    powerpc, powerpc64, powerpc64le, powerpcspe, armv7, aarch64,
                    and riscv64 architectures.

                    >can be installed from bootable ISO images or over the
                    network. Some architectures also support installing from a
                    USB memory stick.
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of the highlights:</p>
                  <p>
                      - The C library now has SIMD implementations of string and
                    memory operations on amd64 for improved performance.<br />
                      - Improvements to the sound subsystem, including device
                    hotplug.<br />
                      - Initial native cloud-init (configuration drive) support
                    compatible with OpenStack and many hosters.<br />
                      - OpenZFS has been upgraded to version 2.2.4.<br />
                      - Clang/LLVM have been upgraded to version 18.1.5.<br />
                      - OpenSSH has been upgraded to version 9.7p1.

                Personally, I generally prefer to compile from source, so most
                of my installations are on a <b>-STABLE</b> branch.
              </p>
              <p>
                I suppose though, it might be a good time to
                <b><i>freebsd-update</i>(8)</b> those that are currently running
                14.0-RELEASE.

                    The social media platform currently allows people to swipe
                    or scroll past adverts that appear in its main feed of
                    images and videos, as well as in its Stories and Reels
                    feeds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it is now trialling a feature called "ad break", which
                    users say they can not flick past as usual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Images shared online show a timer, which counts down to zero
                    before normal functionality can resume.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Sometimes you may need to view an ad before you can keep
                    browsing," the Meta-owned platform tells those who click for
                    more information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instagram has confirmed to the BBC that a trial is under
                    way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We're always testing formats that can drive value for
                    advertisers," it said in a statement, adding that it would
                    provide further updates if the test resulted in permanent
                    format changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It remains to be seen if the trial pleases advertisers - but
                    it certainly does not appear to have gone down well with
                    users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Meta is not the first big tech firm to force people to
                    watch adverts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    YouTube is known for showing non-skippable ads to users
                    watching videos on its platform or TV app who do not pay for
                    its ad-free premium tier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Some users have responded by turning to ad blocking
                    tools and browser extensions as a way around adverts that
                    interrupt videos on the platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google, YouTube's parent company, is in turn trying to clamp
                    down on ad blockers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However it is not clear that forcing users to watch more ads
                    actually helps companies' bottom lines.
                  </p>

                    Cerebrovascular accidents, or strokes, are the most common
                    cause of aphasia, a speech disorder of cerebral origin.
                    People with aphasia have a reduced ability to understand or
                    produce speech or written language. An estimated 40% of
                    people who have had a stroke have aphasia. As many as half
                    of them experience aphasia symptoms even a year after the
                    original attack.

                    >
                    that sung music helps in the language recovery of patients
                    affected by strokes. Now, the researchers have uncovered the
                    reason for the rehabilitative effect of singing. The
                    recently completed study was published in the eNeuro
                    journal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the findings, singing, as it were, repairs the
                    structural language network of the brain. The language
                    network processes language and speech in our brain. In
                    patients with aphasia, the network has been damaged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For the first time, our findings demonstrate that the
                    rehabilitation of patients with aphasia through singing is
                    based on neuroplasticity changes, that is, the plasticity of
                    the brain," says University Researcher

                  <p>
                    The language network encompasses the cortical regions of the
                    brain involved in the processing of language and speech, as
                    well as the white matter tracts that convey information
                    between the different end points of the cortex.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the study results, singing increased the volume
                    of grey matter in the language regions of the left frontal
                    lobe and improved tract connectivity especially in the
                    language network of the left hemisphere, but also in the
                    right hemisphere.

                  <p>
                    "These positive changes were associated with patients'
                    improved speech production," Sihvonen says.

                    These new chips sport the new centralized architecture from
                    AMD, namely Zen 5, on the CPU end. The chipmaker claimed Zen
                    5 is a big update
                    <a
                      href="https://gizmodo.com/amd-zen-4-ryzen-7000-chips-release-date-price-specs-1849470723"
                      >compared to Zen 4</a
                    >, which is supposed to handle twice the bandwidth of the
                    last generation. What does this mean for PCs? AMD promises
                    you’ll see up to 19% better benchmark performance in
                    Geekbench 6 or 13% better in 3DMark’s physics tests, but
                    that will depend on your PC’s exact chip and other
                    architecture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Zen 5 is different from the XDNA 2 NPU architecture. You can
                    break up the TOPS speed in the NPU into a whole bunch of
                    other categories, but AMD claims XDNA 2 is two times as
                    power efficient and many times the total neural computing
                    capacity of the previous gen’s 10 or 16 TOPS.

                    For those who could not care less about the productivity
                    machines centering on the AI 300 chips, all you want to know
                    is how the Ryzen 9000 series stacks up compared to the last
                    generation and Intel’s latest. That includes the Ryzen 5
                    9600X, Ryzen 7 9700X, Ryzen 9 9900X, and at the tippy top
                    end is the Ryzen 9 9950X. Most boast slightly higher clock
                    speeds, but several, like the 9900x and 9700X, are far more
                    power efficient with better TDP.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To pick on the big boy, that 9950X has 16 cores, 32 threads,
                    and up to 5.7 GHz clock speeds. That’s technically the same
                    specs as the Ryzen 9 7950X3D from the last gen. AMD is
                    trying to hit Intel’s Core i9-14900K by claiming you’ll see
                    marginally better framerates in games like
                    <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> or <em>F1 2023</em> and far better
                    bandwidth for multitasking thanks to the new Zen 5
                    architecture.

                    All those gaming-centric CPUs should be arriving in July
                    this year. There’s good news for anybody with the
                    motherboard supporting the AM5 socket. AMD promises to
                    support AM5 through 2027, so if you’re considering
                    upgrading, you’ll have a chance in the next few years. After
                    over eight years of running, AMD plans to end support for
                    AM4 sometime in or after 2025. Zen 5 will continue to be
                    specific to AM5.

                    The chipmaker said pricing is not set for the series 9000
                    chips, but we should know more closer to release in July.

                    A team of researchers from prominent universities –
                    including SUNY Buffalo, Iowa State, UNC Charlotte, and
                    Purdue – were able to turn an autonomous vehicle (AV)
                    operated on the open sourced Apollo driving platform from
                    Chinese web giant Baidu into a deadly weapon by tricking its
                    multi-sensor fusion system.

                    "Extensive experiments based on a real-world AV testbed show
                    that the proposed attack can continuously hide a target

                    have proven vulnerabilities inherent in AV systems, this
                    particular team expanded on single-sensing modality or
                    camera-LiDAR manipulation, and tricked systems that employ
                    Lidar, camera, and radar together.

                  <p>
                    The new attack leverages mmWave reflection – the signals
                    that provide object detection in such systems – on a smooth
                    metal surface. They do this in a way researchers refer to as
                    "low cost" and "easily fabricated" as it involves
                    strategically arranging metal foil and colored patches on
                    cardboard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "By placing a smooth metal surface between the radar and a
                    target vehicle with a specific orientation, the transmitted
                    mmWave signals can be deflected from the radar receiver,
                    leading to a reduction in the energy of echo signals from
                    the vehicle," wrote the study authors. "When the energy
                    becomes lower than a threshold, the target vehicle will be
                    hidden from radar perception."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, the color patch misrepresented input image pixel
                    values and affected Apollo's camera perception. Reflections
                    confused its read on Lidar lasers. Thus all three sensing
                    modalities were compromised.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The [researchers] suggest that the attack could be carried
                    out with drones, which serve to "hide" a secondary vehicle
                    from the victim AV by projecting or carrying the adversarial
                    object. Absent a drone, the trickster collage could be
                    mounted on the front vehicle and disguised as an
                    advertisement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Since the drones only hover for a few seconds during the
                    attack and can fly away from the victim AV immediately after
                    the attack, the attack can be performed with high
                    stealthiness and flexibility," noted the researchers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Baidu Apollo platforms were used in the attack, the
                    attack strategy could theoretically be applied to other
                    multi-sensor fusion systems.

                    It was not created to fuel AI applications, but ERA5 has
                    turned out to be incredibly useful for this purpose.
                    Computer scientists only really got serious about using this
                    data to train AI models to forecast the weather in 2022.
                    Since then, the technology has made rapid strides. In some
                    cases, the output of these models is already superior to
                    global weather models that scientists have labored decades
                    to design and build, and they require some of the most
                    powerful supercomputers in the world to run.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It is clear that machine learning is a significant part of
                    the future of weather forecasting," said Matthew Chantry,
                    who leads AI forecasting efforts at the European weather
                    center known as ECMWF, in an interview with Ars.

                    John Dean and Kai Marshland met as undergraduates at
                    Stanford University in the late 2010s. Dean, an electrical
                    engineer, interned at SpaceX during the summer of 2017.
                    Marshland, a computer scientist, interned at the launch
                    company the next summer. Both graduated in 2019 and were
                    trying to figure out what to do with their lives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We decided we wanted to solve the problem of weather
                    uncertainty," Marshland said, so they co-founded a company
                    called WindBorne Systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Dean and Marshland set about designing small weather
                    balloons they could release into the atmosphere and which
                    would fly around the world for up to 40 days, relaying
                    useful atmospheric data that could be packaged and sold to
                    large, government-funded weather models.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Weather balloons provide invaluable data about atmospheric
                    conditions—readings such as temperature, dewpoints, and
                    pressures—that cannot be captured by surface observations or
                    satellites. Such atmospheric "profiles" are helpful in
                    setting the initial conditions models start with. Such
                    atmospheric "profiles" are helpful in setting the initial
                    conditions models start with. The problem is that
                    traditional weather balloons are cumbersome and only operate
                    for a few hours. Because of this, the National Weather
                    Service only launches them twice daily from about 100
                    locations [weather.gov] in the United States.

                    which suggest generations of young children are more

                    An international research team has now found it's not just
                    in fiction. In a study involving 111 kids aged between 3 and
                    6 years old, the youngsters showed a preference for
                    believing robots more and being more accepting when robots
                    made mistakes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] The kids were split up into different groups and
                    shown videos of robots and humans labeling objects – some
                    objects the children would already recognize, as well as new
                    objects they wouldn't know the names of.

                  <p>
                    Human and robot reliability was demonstrated by giving
                    familiar objects incorrect name, calling a plate a spoon for
                    example. In this way the researchers could manipulate the
                    children's sense of who to trust.

                  <p>

                    accurate. What's more, the children were more likely to
                    favor robots when asked about who they would share secrets
                    with, who they would want to be friends with, and who they
                    would want to

                    "Children's conceptualizations of the agents making a
                    mistake also differed, such that an unreliable human was
                    selected as doing things on purpose, but not an unreliable
                    robot,"

                    "These findings suggest that children's perceptions of a
                    robot's reliability are separate from their evaluation of
                    its desirability as a social interaction partner and its
