                    D&amp;D and Magic: The Gathering publisher, Wizards of the
                    Coast (WotC), has certainly been pissing folks off as of

                    combined with sending the

                    after someone who received some unreleased
                    <em>Magic</em> cards in error, the company appears to have
                    taken a draconian turn in recent years. Then, over the
                    summer, there was a bunch of backlash when WotC was found to
                    have included art from one of its artists that had been
                    <a
                      href="https://www.pcgamer.com/furore-over-dodgy-ai-enhanced-dandd-art-sees-book-revised-and-wotc-swear-off-ai-art-in-perpetuity/"
                      >partially generated using AI generative art</a
                    >
                    in one of its books. After that whole fiasco, WotC publicly
                    swore off using any art in its products that was not 100%
                    human created.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And it’s important to note that this is a huge thing in the
                    D&amp;D and <em>Magic</em> worlds. The books, cards, and
                    associated items that players and fans buy from these games
                    have always been revered in part for the fantastic art that
                    has come along with them. And the artists contributing to
                    them have been equally celebrated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, when sharp-eyed observers of recent promotional art that
                    came out for <em>Magic</em> pointed out it sure looked like
                    the images <em>around</em> the cards showed signs of having
                    been generated by AI, well, WotC
                    <a
                      href="https://www.pcgamer.com/wizards-of-the-coast-denies-using-ai-in-new-magic-the-gathering-image-this-art-was-created-by-humans/"
                      >came out with a very strong denial</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But, no, it turns out that the images around the cards
                    was in fact
                    <a

                      >generated in part using AI</a
                    >, as admitted later on by WotC itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But the real lesson here is that companies have to be
                    very careful with this sort of thing. The internet has
                    enough well-trained Sherlocks out there who are holding
                    companies to their word, looking for anywhere where AI
                    generated content is being snuck in to replace human-made
                    content that, as the technology stands today, there’s a good
                    chance any such uses will be found out. They might as well
                    save themselves the trouble and just make sure the humans
                    are doing the work.

                  <p>
                    America's greenhouse gas emissions fell 1.9 percent in 2023,
                    in large part because the burning of coal to produce
                    electricity plummeted to its lowest level in half a century,
                    according to estimates published on Wednesday by the Rhodium
                    Group, a nonpartisan research firm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The drop means that United States emissions have now fallen
                    roughly 17.2 percent since 2005. There was a huge, anomalous
                    dip in planet-warming pollution at the start of the
                    coronavirus pandemic, when large segments of the economy
                    shut down, followed by a sharp rebound in the following two
                    years once activity resumed. But over the longer term,
                    America's emissions have been trending downward as power
                    plants and cars have gotten cleaner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the decline in emissions to date hasn't been nearly
                    steep enough to meet the nation's goals for trying to slow
                    global warming. President Biden wants to reduce America's
                    greenhouse gas emissions at least 50 percent below 2005
                    levels by 2030. To hit that goal, annual emissions would
                    have to fall more than three times as fast for the rest of
                    the decade as they did last year, the report found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers looked at planet-warming emissions generated
                    by transportation, electricity, industry and buildings but
                    did not include pollution from agriculture, which accounts
                    for roughly 10 percent of the nation's greenhouse gases.

                    The United States is one of 26 countries around the world
                    that have seen emissions decline in recent years even as
                    they enjoy significant economic growth, a study last year
                    found. That list also includes Brazil, Britain, Japan, much
                    of the European Union and South Africa.

                  <p>
                    But globally, carbon dioxide emissions still soared to
                    record levels last year, driven in large part by an increase
                    in fossil fuel use in China, India and other fast-growing
                    countries.

                    as opposed to the pre-rendered demos that are often more
                    common in such cases. But the startup automaker has had
                    anything but an easy time since then. Yesterday, it
                    announced its Q4 2023 deliveries ahead of an investor call
                    in late February, and the numbers are bad.

                    Lucid originally planned to launch the Air sedan in 2019.
                    Designed by Tesla's former VP and Chief Vehicle Engineer
                    Peter Rawlinson, together with designer Derek Jenkins, the
                    Air aimed for Mercedes-Benz S-Class levels of space and
                    luxury on the interior but with the footprint of the smaller
                    Mercedes E-Class. Under its

                  <p>
                    But starting a new car company is neither easy nor cheap.
                    Lucid struggled to obtain funding until Saudi Arabia's
                    sovereign wealth fund
                    <a

                    in 2018, allowing Lucid to complete work on its factory in
                    Arizona and push on with developing the Air.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But those big numbers were matched by an equally big
                    price—$169,000, or $139,000 for the slightly less powerful,
                    slightly shorter-range Air Grand Touring.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since then, the company added some cheaper variants to
                    its lineup—Lucid will sell you an Air Pure for $74,000 after
                    its current incentives are taken into account. But that
                    hasn't resulted in a glut of orders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the last three months of 2023, Lucid built just 2,231
                    Air EVs and delivered 1,734 of those to customers. The
                    results for the whole year weren't any better—Lucid built
                    8,428 cars and delivered 6,001 of those.

                  <p>
                    Chinese company Betavolt has announced an atomic energy
                    battery for consumers with a touted 50-year lifespan. The
                    Betavolt BV100 will be the first product to launch using the
                    firm's new atomic battery technology, constructed using a
                    nickel -63 isotope and diamond semiconductor material.
                    Betavolt says that its nuclear battery will target
                    aerospace, AI devices, medical, MEMS systems, intelligent
                    sensors, small drones, and robots – and may eventually mean
                    manufacturers can sell smartphones that never need charging.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Buying an electronics product that can go mains-free for 50
                    years would be amazing. However, the BV100, which is in the
                    pilot stage ahead of mass production, doesn't offer a lot of
                    power. This 15 x 15 x 5mm battery delivers 100 microwatts at
                    3 volts. It is mentioned that multiple BV100 batteries can
                    be used together in series or parallel depending on device
                    requirements. Betavolt also asserts that it has plans to
                    launch a 1-watt version of its atomic battery in 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In its press release, Betavolt says its atomic battery
                    is very different from similarly described power cells
                    developed by the US and USSR in the 1960s. It says that the
                    old nuclear batteries were large, dangerous, hot, and
                    expensive products. [...] Meanwhile, the Betavolt BV100 is
                    claimed to be safe for consumers and won't leak radiation
                    even if subjected to gunshots or puncture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new, improved levels of safety stem from the choice of
                    materials. Betavolt's battery uses a nickel -63 isotope as
                    the energy source, which decays to a stable isotope of
                    copper. This, plus the diamond semiconductor material, helps
                    the BV100 operate stably in environments ranging from -60 to
                    120 degrees Celsius, according to the firm.

                Cislunar space. The spacecraft are then fueled by an unspecified

                    [...] For now, it looks like the favored answer to the data
                    mystery is to blame Asus for misreporting it. We may never
                    know what happened with Johnie, who is now running his LG
                    washing machine offline. LG did not immediately reply to a
                    request by Tom's Hardware for more information.

                    Another relatively innocent reason for the supposed high
                    volume of uploads could be an error in the Asus router
                    firmware. In a

                    a day after his initial Tweet, Johnie noted "inaccuracy in
                    the ASUS router tool," with regard to Apple iMessage data
                    use. Other LG smart washing machine users showed device data
                    use from their router UIs. It turns out that these
                    appliances more typically use less than 1MB per day.

                    Though Johnie's Tweets were relatively light-hearted,
                    hacking smart connected devices can be severe. Consider what
                    could happen if medical or industrial IoT devices get taken
                    over by attackers, for example. A case in point is provided
                    by a story from earlier this week when Bosch

                    Like SO-DIMMs, CAMM modules are replaceable, though the
                    SO-DIMM slot's simple retention clips are exchanged for a
                    series of screws. But like soldered chips, they support
                    high-speed low-power LPDDR memory, they lie nearly flat
                    against your laptop's mainboard, and you don't need to
                    bother installing them in matched pairs to get dual-channel
                    memory speeds, since a single CAMM module can support both
                    single- and dual-channel speeds (with "future multi-channel
                    setups" also possible, according to JEDEC).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first hurdle for CAMM will be the same one any new
                    standard faces: getting the buy-in necessary to displace
                    already-prevalent standards. Crucial demoing a new LCAMM2
                    module is a solid step forward in that department, and
                    Samsung's commitment to introducing CAMM memory sometime
                    this year is another one. The standard already obviously has
                    buy-in from Dell, which
                    <a

                      >previous reporting from PCWorld</a
                    >
                    suggests that it has wide industry support as an eventual
                    replacement for SO-DIMM modules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The real question might not be whether CAMM replaces SO-DIMM
                    slots in the relatively small number of laptops that still
                    feature upgradable memory, but whether it can take us back
                    to a time when you could <em>assume</em> laptop memory would
                    be upgradable instead of having to search for a laptop that
                    supported it. As a PC manufacturer, why support CAMM in your
                    laptops when you could continue soldering RAM down, locking
                    buyers into paying whatever price you set for upgrades? The
                    prevalence of fast, standardized M.2 SSDs hasn't kept Apple
                    from sticking with its own proprietary storage in Macs, for
                    example.

                in the near future. His announcement describes the rationale,

                    The next release of OpenSSH (due around 2024/03) will make
                    DSA optional at compile time, but still enable it by
                    default. Users and downstream distributors of OpenSSH may
                    use this option to explore the impact of DSA removal in
                    their environments, or to hard-deprecate it early if they
                    desire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Around 2024/06, a release of OpenSSH will change this
                    compile-time default to disable DSA. It may still be enabled
                    by users/distributors if needed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, in the first OpenSSH release after 2025/01/01 the
                    DSA code will be removed entirely.
                  </p>

                    2024/06 (estimated) - DSA compile-time optional, *disabled*

                      by University of British Columbia (UBC) zoologists.

                      "When in forward fight, hummingbirds rely on what we call
                      an 'internal forward model'—almost an ingrained, intuitive
                      autopilot—to gauge speed," says Dr. Vikram B. Baliga, lead
                      author of a new study on hummingbird locomotion published
                      in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. "There's just too
                      much information coming in to rely directly on every
                      visual cue from your surroundings."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      "But when hovering or dealing with cues that might require
                      a change in altitude, we found they rely much more on
                      real-time, direct visual feedback from their environment."

                    <p>
                      The findings not only provide insights into how the tiny,
                      agile birds perceive the world during transitions in
                      flight, but could inform the programming of onboard
                      navigation for next-generation autonomous flying and
                      hovering vehicles.

                    A newly discovered object is stretching our understanding of
                    what constitutes a galaxy.

                    Called J0613+52, this massive blob of something some 270
                    million light-years away appears to have no stars
                    whatsoever. At least, none that can be seen. It's just a
                    haze made of the kind of gas that's found between stars in
                    normal galaxies, drifting around by its lone self like an
                    absolute badass.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Its mass and motion appear to be normal for what we'd expect
                    of a spiral galaxy... in fact, if you extracted the stars
                    from a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way or Andromeda,
                    J0613+52 is pretty much what you'd end up with.

                    According to a team of astronomers led by astrophysicist
                    Karen O'Neil of the Green Bank Observatory, it could be the
                    first discovery of a primordial galaxy in the nearby
                    Universe – a galaxy made up mostly of the gas that formed at
                    the beginning of time.

                    Whirligig beetles, the world's fastest-swimming insect,
                    achieve surprising speeds by employing a strategy shared by
                    speedy marine mammals and waterfowl, according to a new
                    Cornell University study that rewrites previous explanations
                    of the physics involved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The centimeter-long beetles can reach a peak acceleration of
                    100 meters per second and a top velocity of 100 body lengths
                    per second (or one meter per second).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not only do the results explain the whirligig's Olympian
                    speeds, but they also offer valuable insights for
                    bio-inspired designers of near-surface water robots and
                    uncrewed boats.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Until now, researchers have believed that whirligigs attain
                    their impressive speeds using a propulsion system called
                    drag-based thrust. This type of thrust requires the insect's
                    legs to move faster than the swimming speed, in order for
                    the legs to generate any thrust. For the whirligig beetle to
                    achieve such fast swimming speeds, its legs would need to
                    push against the water at unrealistic speeds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It could have well been questioned," said Chris Roh,
                    assistant biological and environmental engineering
                    professor. "The fastest swimmer and drag-based thrust don't
                    usually go together in the same sentence."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In fact, fast-swimming marine mammals and waterfowls tend to
                    forgo drag-based thrust in favor of lift-based thrust,
                    another propulsion system. The finding was described in a
                    study published Jan. 8 in the journal Current Biology.<br />...<br />Using
                    two high-speed cameras synchronized at different angles, the
                    researchers could film a whirligig and observe a lift-based
                    thrust mechanism at play. Lift-based thrust works like a
                    propeller, where the thrusting motion is perpendicular to
                    the water surface, eliminating drag and allowing for more
                    efficient momentum capable of greater speed.

                    people with Alzheimer's by 32%.

                    of aducanumab, a lab-made antibody that is delivered via IV.
                    This drug, first approved in 2021,  helps clear away
                    beta-amyloid, a protein fragment that clumps up in the
                    brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. (<a

                      >The drug's approval was controversial</a
                    >, and it's still not clear whether it actually slows
                    progression of the disease.)  After the infusion, the
                    researchers treated specific regions of the patients' brains
                    with focused ultrasound, but just on one side. That allowed
                    them to use the other half of the brain as a control. PET
                    scans revealed a greater reduction in amyloid plaques in the
                    ultrasound-treated regions than in those same regions on the
                    untreated side of the brain, suggesting that more of the
                    antibody was getting into the brain on the treated side.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Aducanumab does clear plaques without ultrasound, but it
                    takes a long time, perhaps in part because the antibody has
                    trouble entering the brain. "Instead of using the therapy
                    intravenously for 18 to 24 months to see the plaque
                    reduction, we want to see if we can achieve that reduction
                    in a few months," says Ali Rezai, a neurosurgeon at West
                    Virginia University Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute and
                    an author of the new study. Cutting the amount of time
                    needed to clear these plaques might help slow the memory
                    loss and cognitive problems that define the disease.

                    The device used to target and deliver the ultrasound waves,
                    developed by a company called
                    <a href="https://insightec.com/">Insightec</a>, consists of
                    an MRI machine and a helmet studded with ultrasound
                    transducers. It's FDA approved, but for an entirely
                    different purpose: to help stop tremors in people with
                    Parkinson's by creating lesions in the brain. To open the
                    blood-brain barrier, "we inject individuals intravenously
                    with microbubbles," Rezai says. These tiny gas bubbles,
                    commonly used as a contrast agent, travel through the
                    bloodstream. Using the MRI, the researchers can aim the
                    ultrasound waves at very specific parts of the brain "with
                    millimeter precision," Rezai says. When the waves hit the
                    microbubbles, the bubbles begin to expand and contract,
                    physically pushing apart the tightly packed cells that line
                    the brain's capillaries. "This temporary opening can last up
                    to 48 hours, which means that during those 48 hours, you can
                    have increased penetration into the brain of therapeutics,"
                    he says.

                    US hospitals will be required to meet basic cybersecurity
                    standards before receiving federal funding, according to
                    rules the White House is expected to propose in the next few

                    The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), an arm

                    reportedly drawing up rules connecting hospital IT security

                    says the proposed rules will focus on "those key
                    cybersecurity practices that we really do believe bring a
                    meaningful impact." And federal funding will hinge on

                    [heard] its first hearing in South Africa's genocide case
                    against Israel on Thursday, with several countries welcoming
                    the move amid a global chorus for a ceasefire in Gaza.

                  <p>
                    South Africa filed the lawsuit end of December, accusing
                    Israel of genocide in its war on Gaza and seeking a halt to
                    the brutal military assault that has killed more than 23,000
                    Palestinians, nearly 10,000 of them children.

                    Both Israel and South Africa are signatories to the United
                    Nations Genocide Convention, which gives the ICJ – the
                    highest UN legal body – jurisdiction to rule on disputes
                    over the treaty.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All states that signed the convention are obliged to not
                    commit genocide and also to prevent and punish it. The
                    treaty defines genocide as "acts committed with intent to
                    destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial
                    or religious group".

                    [...] The ICC and the ICJ are sometimes conflated with one
                    another. Both the courts are located in The Hague,
                    Netherlands. While the purpose of the ICJ is to resolve
                    conflicts between states, the ICC prosecutes individuals for
                    committing crimes, according to the University of
                    Melbourne's Pursuit platform. While states cannot be sued at
                    the ICC, the prosecutor can open an investigation where
                    crimes, including genocide, were likely committed.

                    The United States has voiced its opposition to the genocide
                    case. National security spokesperson John Kirby called South
                    Africa's submission "meritless, counterproductive, and
                    completely without any basis" during a White House press
                    briefing on January 3.

                    Israeli President Isaac Herzog told US Secretary of State
                    Antony Blinken on Tuesday that "there is nothing more
                    atrocious and preposterous" than the lawsuit. Herzog also
                    thanked Blinken for Washington's support of Israel.

                    Researchers have created the world's largest ancient human
                    gene bank by analyzing the bones and teeth of almost 5,000
                    humans who lived across western Europe and Asia up to 34,000
                    years ago.

                  <p>
                    By sequencing ancient human DNA and comparing it to
                    modern-day samples, the international team of experts mapped
                    the historical spread of genes—and diseases—over time as
                    populations migrated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 'astounding' results have been revealed in four
                    trailblazing research papers published (10 January 2024) in
                    the same issue of Nature and provide new biological
                    understanding of debilitating disorders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The extraordinary study involved a large international team
                    led by Professor Eske Willerslev at the Universities of
                    Cambridge and Copenhagen, Professor Thomas Werge at the
                    University of Copenhagen, and Professor Rasmus Nielsen at
                    University of California, Berkeley and involved
                    contributions from 175 researchers from around the globe.
                  </p>
                  <p>The scientists found:</p>
                  <ul>

                      The startling origins of neurodegenerative diseases
                      including multiple sclerosis

                    <li>
                      Why northern Europeans today are taller than people from
                      southern Europe
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      How major migration around 5,000 years ago introduced risk
                      genes into the population in north-western Europe—leaving
                      a legacy of higher rates of MS today
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Carrying the MS gene was an advantage at the time as it
                      protected ancient farmers from catching infectious
                      diseases from their sheep and cattle
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Genes known to increase the risk of diseases such as
                      Alzheimer's and type 2 diabetes were traced back to hunter
                      gatherers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Future analysis is hoped to reveal more about the genetic
                      markers of autism, ADHD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
                      and depression
                    </li>

                  <p>
                    Northern Europe has the highest prevalence of MS in the
                    world. A new study has found the genes that significantly
                    increase a person's risk of developing MS were introduced
                    into north-western Europe around 5,000 years ago by sheep
                    and cattle herders migrating from the east.

                    The final hurdle to retrieving the full sample of asteroid
                    Bennu collected by OSIRIS-REx – the first asteroid return
                    sample in US history – has at last been overcome. NASA
                    technicians have been able to successfully remove the two
                    fasteners from the sampler head that have been preventing
                    them from opening the canister fully since September. This
                    canister opening has to be conducted under the most pristine
                    conditions to not contaminate the sample, so this was quite
                    the issue. Now, NASA can get to the pristine material from
                    asteroid Bennu.

                    shipments, by growing 0.3 percent in Q4 of 2023, amid a
                    warning that the cost of components will rise this year, as
                    will the cost of laptops and desktops.

                    This is according to analyst Gartner's figures, but other
                    analysts have a different view of proceedings: IDC reckons
                    this was the eighth straight quarter of "sales-out"
                    shrinkage - meaning sales to retailers and distributors -
                    and Canalys estimates the market actually grew three
                    percent.

                    “The PC market has hit the bottom of its decline after
                    significant adjustment," said Mikako Kitagawa, director
                    analyst at Gartner. "Inventory was normalized in the fourth
                    quarter of 2023, which had been plaguing the industry for

                    Things certainly seem to be improving but those heady days
                    of the pandemic, when the total available market swelled to
                    350 million in 2021, seem like a long time ago.

                    For centuries, a prevailing theory in philosophy has
                    asserted that at birth the human mind is a blank slate. More
                    recently, the same notion has also held sway in the field of
                    neurobiology, where it is commonly held that neural
                    connections are slowly created from scratch with the
                    accumulation of sensory information and experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eventually, the theory goes, this allows us to create
                    memories in space and time and to then learn from those
                    experiences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But after spending more than a decade studying activity in
                    the hippocampus, the area of brain which forms memory,
                    Yale's George Dragoi began to have his doubts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In his research on the hippocampus of rodents, Dragoi, an
                    associate professor of psychiatry and of neuroscience, has
                    found that early in life there emerge in this part of the
                    brain individual functional clusters of cells (and, soon
                    after, short sequences of cells) that predictably will be
                    activated by new experiences. Within days of birth, he
                    found, these cells, clusters, and short sequences become the
                    foundation for increasingly complex sequences of cell
                    assemblies that allow for the creation of memories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new article
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-023-00763-0"
                      >published</a
                    >
                    in the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Dragoi makes the
                    case that the human brain also develops a cellular template
                    soon after birth which defines who we are and how we
                    perceive the world. He describes it as "the generative
                    grammar" of the brain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Neurons organize like letters, then words, then sentences
                    and paragraphs which allow for the internalization of the
                    outside world," Dragoi said. "The brain has its own built-in
                    sense of grammar."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea, he admits, runs counter to the tenets of
                    empiricism, a centuries-old theory that all knowledge is
                    derived from sensory experience. It also contradicts widely
                    held assumption by life scientists that environmental
                    stimuli will entirely dictate how the brain processes and
                    stores information.

                    Logo text More than a decade ago, the normalization of tech
                    companies carrying content created by news organizations
                    without directly paying them — cannibalizing readership and
                    ad revenue — precipitated the decline of the media industry.
                    With the rise of generative artificial intelligence, those
                    same firms threaten to further tilt the balance of power
                    between Big Tech and news.

                    On Wednesday, lawmakers in the Senate Judiciary Committee
                    referenced their failure to adopt legislation that would've
                    barred the exploitation of content by Big Tech in backing
                    proposals that would require AI companies to strike
                    licensing deals with news organizations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and chair of the
                    committee, joined several other senators in supporting calls
                    for a licensing regime and to establish a framework
                    clarifying that intellectual property laws don't protect AI
                    companies using copyrighted material to build their
                    chatbots.

                    [...] The fight over the legality of AI firms eating content
                    from news organizations without consent or compensation is
                    split into two camps: Those who believe the practice is
                    protected under the "fair use" doctrine in intellectual
                    property law that allows creators to build upon copyrighted
                    works, and those who argue that it constitutes copyright
                    infringement. Courts are currently wrestling with the issue,
                    but an answer to the question is likely years away. In the
                    meantime, AI companies continue to use copyrighted content
                    as training materials, endangering the financial viability
                    of media in a landscape in which readers can bypass direct
                    sources in favor of search results generated by AI tools.

                    licensing its content. Before suing, it said that it had
                    been talking for months with OpenAI and Microsoft about a
                    deal, though the talks reached no such truce. In the
                    backdrop of AI companies crawling the internet for
                    high-quality written content, news organizations have been
                    backed into a corner, having to decide whether to accept
                    lowball offers to license their content or expend the time
                    and money to sue in a lawsuit. Some companies, like Axel

                The OpenWRT project is turning 20 years old this year. During
                that time they have adapted to existing hardware products. Now

                    It is not [a] new [idea]. We first spoke about this during
                    the OpenWrt Summits in 2017 and also 2018. It became clear
                    start of December 2023 while tinkering with Banana Pi style
                    devices that they are already pretty close to what we wanted
                    to achieve in '17/'18. Banana PIs have grown in popularity
                    within the community. They boot using a self compiled
                    Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A)and upstream U-Boot (thx
                    MTK/Daniel) and some of the boards are already fully
                    supported by the upstream Linux kernel. The only nonopen
                    sourcecomponents are the 2.5 GbE PHYandWi-Fi firmware
                    blobsrunning on separate cores that areindependent of the
                    main SoC running Linuxand the DRAM calibration routines
                    which are executed early during boot.

                    I contacted three project members (pepe2k, dangole, nbd) on
                    December 6th to outline the overall idea. We went over
                    several design proposals, At the beginning we focused on the
                    most powerful (and expensive) configurations possible but
                    finally ended up with something rather simple and above
                    all,feasible. We would like to propose the following as our
                    "first" community driven HW platform called "OpenWrt
                    One/AP-24.XY".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Together with pepe2k (thx a lot) I discussed this for many
                    hours and we worked out the following project proposal.
                    Instead of going insane with specifications, we decided to
                    include some nice features we believe all OpenWrt supported
                    platforms should have (e.g. being almost unbrickablewith
                    multiple recovery options, hassle-free system console
                    access, on-board RTC with battery backup etc.).
                  </p>
                  <p>This is our first design, so let's KiSS!</p>

                The preliminary hardware specifications are included in the
                message and it will contain a pair of flash chips for redundancy
                with the aim to make the router harder to accidentally brick
                during an update.

                    The belief that all fingerprints are unique is so well
                    accepted that crime novels and TV shows riff on it. Recent
                    AI research has challenged this notion, at least regarding
                    the fingerprints on different fingers of the same person.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Undergrad researchers at Columbia Engineering
                    <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1030475"

                    that while the branching and endpoints in the fingerprint
                    ridges might vary, the angles and curvature at the center of
                    the fingerprint could be the same across an individual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To determine this, the students used a deep contrastive
                    network and a US government database of 60,000 fingerprints
                    to study commonalities in fingerprints. They fed pairs of
                    prints to a neural network, with some coming from the same
                    person and others from different individuals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The network eventually became able to identify if prints
                    were from the same person to an accuracy of 77 percent. That
                    accuracy increased when multiple pairs of prints were
                    presented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team initially had no idea how the network was able to
                    identify whether the prints belonged to the same person. To
                    the human eye, the fingerprints certainly did not appear
                    similar.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In order to understand that it was merely identifying the
                    angles and starting points of the ridges, they had to study
                    the AI system's decision process. Thus, the team concluded
                    that the AI was using an unexpected forensic marker.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As it turns out, humans can be so set in their processes not
                    only when it comes to identifying prints but also
                    identifying science. The first journal the team submitted
                    their results to rejected them with the conclusion: "It is
                    well known that every fingerprint is unique," according to

                Windows isn't even telling users the correct error. Microsoft
                claims the update is failing on systems where the recovery
                partition isn't large enough. From my own experience, I have
                systems where I allowed the Windows installer to partition the
                drive automatically, meaning that Windows determined the size of
                the recovery partition. Windows 10 chose a size of 509 MB on my
                systems, and this doesn't seem to be scaled depending on the
                size of the user's drive. For most users, this is probably set
                automatically by the installer or the computer manufacturer.
                That said, I've read a user comment that the update

                  >manually resize the recovery partition</a
                >. The commands are not intuitive, and there's absolutely no
                reason that Microsoft should be expecting ordinary users to be
                doing this. Resizing partitions is a fairly high risk operation,
                one that carries a risk of data loss if not done properly.

                This vulnerability probably just isn't a risk at all for most
                users, but that's not necessarily obvious. They just see the
                message that a security update failed with a cryptic error
                message. It's Microsoft's responsibility to ensure that security
                updates just work when they're being installed on a system in a
                reasonably standard configuration. If the Windows installer
                chose a recovery partition of 509 MB, then Microsoft needs to
                make their updates work with a recovery partition of that size,
                or they need to automatically resize the partition. This is a
                dumpster fire, and it's inexcusable to expect Microsoft to
                expect users to manually repartition their drives.

                    A recent investigation undertaken by Pesticide Action
                    Network (PAN) revealed that the UK is still using 36 harmful
                    pesticides that have been banned in other European
                    countries, with 13 described as "highly hazardous" that have

                    completed a successful field trial of a material they have
                    developed to help to protect crops from fungi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Simon Avery, professor of eukaryotic microbiology in the
                    Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, said, "The test
                    material is not toxic but works by passively resisting
                    attachment of fungal spores to protect surfaces from fungal
                    infection, including crop surfaces. Results from this first
                    field trial with wheat are particularly encouraging as there
                    is a lot of scope to optimize further the material
                    properties for crop protection."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We identified two lead polymer candidates by
                    bio-performance testing using in vitro microplates and
                    leaf-based assays. These were then taken forward into a
                    program to optimize and scale up their synthesis and
                    compound them into a spray formulation that could be used on
                    crops. Our findings showed that the material not only
                    significantly reduced fungal infection by the fungus
                    Septoria tritici by up to 26% but also that the crop grew
                    just as well as the control group—providing an alternative
                    that appears safer for the environment, wildlife, and
                    people, and is effective, too."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sprayed directly onto wheat at timings conventional for
                    fungicides, the trial has provided the first real-world
                    scale exemplification of how the material interacts with
                    crops. The small plot trial compared the two polymer
                    candidates to a multisite fungicide and two commercial
                    fungicide programs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Valentina said, "Our attention is now turning to a
                    second field trial that's in the diary for this year to
                    further hone and improve the polymer so we can continue
                    turning our research into reality. The beauty of a material
                    like this is its lack of toxicity, the relative simplicity
                    of its production and the fact that it can be scaled up
                    easily—making it an incredibly attractive prospect for
                    several other industries, not just agriculture."

                    of its debt-holders that will allow it to reduce its debt.
                    The company says the plan would reduce its debt by 80% from

                    Back in 2019 we noted how the streaming sector risked
                    driving consumers back to piracy if they didn't heed the
                    lessons of the past. We explored how the rush to raise
                    rates, nickel-and-dime users, implement arbitrary
                    restrictions, and force users toward hunting and pecking

                    NASA leadership is expected on Tuesday to announce a
                    "months-long delay" to the first crewed mission of the
                    agency's flagship Artemis program, according to one current
                    and one former NASA employee.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The delay affects NASA's Artemis II mission, which aims to
                    send four astronauts on a journey to fly by the moon and was
                    slated to lift off this November.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the mission is no longer expected to take place before
                    2025, according to the sources, confirming months of
                    speculation that a delay was imminent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA's Inspector General hinted at potential delays for the
                    mission in a November report, citing three main challenges
                    the space agency must address before it can safely fly
                    humans to the moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, the ground structure used to build, transport and
                    launch the program's massive Space Launch System rocket —
                    dubbed Mobile Launcher 1 — "sustained more damage than
                    expected."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The November report stated that repairs to the structure
                    were ongoing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, the heat shield on the Orion spacecraft — intended
                    to be the astronauts' home on Artemis II — "eroded in an
                    unexpected way" during Artemis I as it was exposed to
                    temperatures about half as hot as the surface of the sun
                    upon reentry into Earth's atmosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, the Inspector General noted what NASA officials
                    believed to be "the primary critical path" for the Artemis
                    II mission: preparing Orion for its first crew and
                    integrating it with the European Service Module, which
                    provides power and propulsion. The "critical path" in
                    project planning refers to the aspect of the mission that's
                    expected to take the longest.

                    >, a study published in the journal <em>Blood</em> reported
                    on three unrelated people with recurrent infections and a
                    significant lack of T cells, specialized white blood cells
                    crucial to the immune system, had the same mutation that
                    hyperactivates Rac2. The study also observed that many of
                    the patient's neutrophils, cells that capture and ingest
                    invading microorganisms, were enlarged, indicating they were
                    consuming a lot of cellular material.

                  <p>
                    After reading this study, Denise Montell, who was involved
                    in the 1996 research and is the corresponding author in the
                    current study, wondered whether the T cells' disappearance
                    was due to innate immune cells with active Rac2 eating them,
                    as had happened with the fruit flies. So, Montell and the
                    other researchers turned their focus to macrophages, the
                    voracious counterpart of the neutrophil. The researchers
                    cultured human macrophages with and without hyperactive
                    Rac2, together with T cells, and found that macrophages with
                    hyperactive Rac consumed more cells, confirming their
                    hypothesis.

                    'Phoenix' lineup of APUs for its desktop AM5 PCs here at CES
                    2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada, bringing 1080p-capable integrated
                    graphics to the company's newest platform for the first
                    time, not to mention unlocking a new lower entry pricing
                    point to the AM5 ecosystem. The two flagship Ryzen 8000G
                    processors are also the world's first desktop CPUs with an
                    integrated high-performance Neural Processing Unit (NPU)
                    engine to boost performance in AI workloads, beating Intel
                    to the punch again — AMD was also the first x86 chipmaker to
                    bring an NPU to laptops. Now, they've come to the desktop

                    AMD's new Ryzen AI Software suite is designed to allow both
                    enthusiasts and developers to deploy pre-trained AI models
                    on its silicon with a one-click approach that greatly
                    simplifies the process. Users can select machine learning
                    models trained on frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow and
                    use AMD's Vitis AI quantizer to quantize the model into an
                    ONNX format. The software then partitions and compiles the
                    model, which runs on the Ryzen NPU. The Ryzen AI Software is
                    available now for free, and AMD also has a pre-optimized
                    model zoo on Hugging Face available.

                    used hearing aids had a 24% lower risk of mortality than

                    plans—and also said the plans wouldn't work for the US,
                    anyway. "Bulk importation will not provide an effective
                    solution to the problem of high drug prices in the US,"

                    >, claiming the drug imports will save the state "up to $180
                    million in the first year alone." There are caveats, though.
                    Before Florida can import any drugs, it must complete
                    several obligations, including submitting to the FDA
                    additional drug-specific information, testing the drugs for
                    authenticity and FDA compliance, and relabeling them in
                    accordance with FDA labeling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The FDA authorized the importation program in accordance
                    with section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
                    (FD&amp;C Act). The move stems from President Biden's
                    "Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American
                    Economy," which directed the FDA to help develop such
                    programs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Proponents of the program in the US say that importing
                    cheaper drugs from abroad could help lower US drug prices by
                    offering more competition on the market. Canada, like other
                    countries, has lower drug prices than the US, partly because
                    the country's national health system negotiates prices for
                    prescription drugs.

                    But Canada, which has a population around nine times smaller
                    than the US, has been staunchly opposed to the US importing
                    its drugs. It has repeatedly said that diverting medicines
                    to the US could lead to drug shortages in Canada, make
                    existing shortages worse, and/or cause price spikes.

                    The ancient, palm-sized fossil is fascinating, but a common
                    household curio: Teeth from the giant extinct shark — which
                    grew around 50 feet long, which is longer than a city bus —
                    are frequently found in accessible coastal areas worldwide.
                    The sharks' huge jaws were lined with 276 teeth, and they
                    likely lost and replaced thousands over their lifetimes,
                    allowing plenty of teeth the chance to fossilize.

                    The term <em>enshittification </em>became popular in 2023
                    after it was used in a blog post by author Cory Doctorow,
                    who used it to describe how digital platforms can become
                    worse and worse. "Here is how platforms die: first, they are
                    good to their users; then they abuse their users to make
                    things better for their business customers; finally, they
                    abuse those business customers to claw back all the value
                    for themselves. Then, they die. I call this
                    enshittification," Doctorow wrote on his Pluralistic blog.

                    Presiding at the Jan. 6 voting session were Ben Zimmer,
                    chair of the ADS New Words Committee and language columnist
                    for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and Dr. Kelly
                    Elizabeth Wright of Virginia Tech, data czar of the New
                    Words Committee. "<em>Enshittification</em> is a sadly apt
                    term for how our online lives have become gradually
                    degraded," Zimmer said. "From the time that it first
                    appeared in Doctorow's posts and articles, the word had all
                    the markings of a successful neologism, being instantly
                    memorable and adaptable to a variety of contexts."

                    linked to your mentality. Simply put, the less you share
                    about yourself online, the less identifiable you will be.
                    That means being careful about what you post on social

                    Federal investigators have discovered a second contaminant
                    in recalled applesauce pouches — the naturally-occurring
                    metal chromium, which in a certain form can cause a number

                    The FDA has reported finding extraordinarily high levels of
                    lead in samples of cinnamon from the Ecuador plant where the
                    pouches were made. On Friday, the agency reported it had
                    also found chromium. Chromium is an

                    >
                    found in foods and dietary supplements, but in one form —
                    called chromium-6 — it can cause harm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Lead chromate, which contains the potentially toxic
                    chromium-6, has been used in the past to enhance the
                    coloring of

                      href="https://stanmed.stanford.edu/turmeric-lead-risk-detect/"
                      >turmeric</a
                    >. Federal investigators say the "lead-to-chromium ratio" in
                    the applesauce pouches "is consistent with that of lead
                    chromate."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But investigators said the chromium in lead chromate
                    may be converted to the less toxic form chromium-3, "due to
                    the acidity of the applesauce and the stomach."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Michael Beuhler, the medical director of North Carolina
                    Poison Control, said the discovery of chromium in the
                    applesauce and cinnamon does not necessarily mean the
                    substance will cause harm. He said that "at the levels we're
                    talking about," he doesn't believe there would be much
                    chromium-6 in the pouches. Any chromium-6 that might have
                    been present would probably reduce to a nontoxic form once
                    inside the applesauce pouches, he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said lead chromate could have been added as a powder to
                    cinnamon to affect the weight and color of the spice. Lead
                    chromate can be more than six times heavier than cinnamon,
                    he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I don't believe that this is any cause for additional
                    alarm," Beuhler said. "But it does suggest why it happened."

                    Anyone following the fusion news out of LLNL knows that,
                    while the X-ray beam that hit the fusion fuel pellet – a
                    diamond-encased, pea sized lump of deuterium and tritium –
                    may have delivered 2.05 megajoules of energy to the pellet
                    and produced 3.15 megajoules, it took far more energy than
                    that to get the whole thing accomplished.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fuel pellet sits inside a cylindrical chamber known as a
                    hohlraum, which converts laser energy into X-rays that
                    ignite the pellet. Those lasers output 322 megajoules of
                    energy – all but 2.05 mj of which is lost in the conversion
                    to X-rays.

                    In essence, Edwards said, the whole system only has an
                    efficiency of around 1 percent, but that could change in
                    2024.

                    [...] For starters, using laser fusion to generate power
                    means shooting fuel pellets somewhere in the neighborhood of
                    one to ten times every second – instead of once a month like
                    the NIF.

                    That means mass production of targets, a method of
                    extracting energy from said targets, and a reliable method
                    of scaling the entire system. In other words, developing an
                    entire framework for an integrated fusion plant – which will
                    be a major part of LLNL's work in the coming year and

                  installing a backdoor into her secure messaging program, the
                  agent did not know what he was in for</a
                >:

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    At a recent RSA Security Conference, Nico Sell was on stage
                    announcing that her company—Wickr—was making drastic changes
                    to ensure its users' security. She said that the company
                    would switch from RSA encryption to
                    <a
                      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman"
                      >elliptic curve encryption</a
                    >, and that the service wouldn't have a backdoor for anyone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As she left the stage, before she'd even had a chance to
                    take her microphone off, a man approached her and introduced
                    himself as an agent with the Federal Bureau of
                    Investigation. He then proceeded to "casually" ask if she'd
                    be willing to install a backdoor into Wickr that would allow
                    the FBI to retrieve information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This encounter, and the agent's casual demeanor, is
                    apparently business as usual as intelligence and law
                    enforcement agencies seek to gain greater access into
                    protected communication systems. Since her encounter with
                    the agent at RSA, Sell says it's a story she's heard again
                    and again. "It sounds like that's how they do it now," she
                    told SecurityWatch. "Always casual, testing, because most
                    people would say yes."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It was clear that the FBI agent didn't know who he was
                    dealing with, because Sell did not back down. Instead, she
                    lectured him on topics ranging from the First and Fourth
                    Amendments to the Constitution, to George Washington's
                    creation of a Post Office in the US. "My ancestor was a
                    drummer boy under Washington," Sell explained. "Washington
                    thought it was very important to have freedom of information
                    and private correspondence without government surveillance."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Her lecture concluded, she proceeded to grill the agent. "I
                    asked if he had official paperwork for me, if this was an
                    official request, who his boss was," said Sell. "He backed
                    down very quickly."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Though she didn't budge for the agent, Sell makes it clear
                    that surveillance and security is a complicated issue. "Ten
                    years ago, I'd have said yes," said Sell. "Because if law
                    enforcement asks you to catch bad guys, who wouldn't want to
                    help?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The difference now, she explained, was her experiences at
                    BlackHat. Among those, Sell pointed to a BlackHat event
                    where
                    <a
                      href="http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-10/Cross_Tom/BlackHat-DC-2010-Cross-Attacking-LawfulI-Intercept-wp.pdf"

                    how to break into lawful intercept machines—or wiretaps. "It
                    was very clear that a backdoor for the good guys is always a
                    backdoor for the bad guys."

                    Most message apps tout their privacy features in some way.
                    It is common to hear marketing language about "end-to-end
                    encryption" and "private messaging" for basically every
                    communications app out there.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While it's great that encryption has become a selling point
                    for the public, not every "encrypted messaging service" is
                    made equally. Depending on how it is set up, your message
                    app may leak metadata, contacts, and even message contents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A recently uncovered FBI document obtained by a group called
                    Property of the People and shared with Rolling Stone
                    illustrates just how important your choice of private
                    messenger can be. If you think popular options like Apple's
                    iMessage and the Meta company formerly known as Facebook's
                    WhatsApp are FBI-proof, think again. The nation's top cops
                    can obtain a host of message information on many popular
                    options including some mix of "subscriber data, message
                    sender-receiver data, device backup, IP address, encryption
                    keys, date/time information, registration time data, and
                    user contacts."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Nine popular messaging applications are included in
                    the document: Apple's iMessage; Line, a Japanese message
                    app; Signal, an open source encrypted chat platform
                    popularized by Edward Snowden; Telegram, which originated in
                    Russia and is now based in Dubai; Threema, a paid encryption
                    chat (that I used to use) with servers based in Switzerland;
                    Viber, which was developed in Cyprus and then bought by the
                    Japanese conglomerate Rakuten; the Chinese Swiss army knife
                    app WeChat; Meta's WhatsApp; and Wickr [Me], which is a chat
                    service that Amazon Web Services apparently owns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The bottom line: of the most popular apps, iMessage and
                    WhatsApp are particularly susceptible to FBI snooping.
                    Telegram and Signal score far better according to the FBI
                    documents. (Line and Viber are also relatively bad picks,
                    and my formerly favored Threema likewise fares more poorly
                    than I'd have expected, but since they aren't as popular
                    this probably isn't relevant for you.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Now to the encryption winners. It's no surprise that
                    Signal fared well against favored FBI methods. It's open
                    source, independent (albeit with some surprising
                    partnerships), and touted by public personalities with
                    privacy-focused bonafides. Still, I would have expected the
                    FBI to have access to more metadata than they apparently do.
                    Way to go, Signal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Telegram especially surprised me for scoring so well.
                    End-to-end encryption is not the default for most Telegram
                    communications. You need to select a "secret chat" with an
                    individual to get the full-bodied protection that the FBI
                    document seems to indicate. Groups chats, which is the
                    method preferred of many Telegram users, do not offer the
                    same level of end-to-end encryption. Neither the FBI
                    document nor the Rolling Stone article makes mention of
                    this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Weirdly, Rolling Stone does not mention Telegram at all,
                    despite being the apparently most FBI-proof application all
                    around and much more popular than Wickr, which does get a
                    nod. The FBI document does note that Telegram may choose to
                    divulge IP addresses and phone numbers for "confirmed
                    terrorist investigations," but it cites Telegram's public
                    policy rather than any secret backchannel.

                    saying the company would be grounding its fleet of 65 Boeing
                    737-9 aircraft for what it expects to be a few days as it
                    conducts safety checks. “Each aircraft will be returned to
                    service only after completion of full maintenance and safety
                    inspections,” Minicucci. The FAA order extends the grounding
                    to “approximately 171 airplanes worldwide” that are either
                    operated by US airlines or in US territory.

                    “we will fully support their investigation.” The plane had

                    One of the greatest challenges of modern physics is to find
                    a coherent method for describing phenomena, on the cosmic
                    and microscale. For over a hundred years, to describe
                    reality on a cosmic scale we have been using general
                    relativity theory, which has successfully undergone repeated
                    attempts at falsification.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Albert Einstein curved space-time to describe gravity, and
                    despite still-open questions about dark matter or dark
                    energy, it seems, today, to be the best method of analyzing
                    the past and future of the universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To describe phenomena on the scale of atoms, we use the
                    second great theory: quantum mechanics, which differs from
                    general relativity in basically everything. It uses flat
                    space-time and a completely different mathematical
                    apparatus, and most importantly, perceives reality radically
                    differently.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the quantum description, the phenomena around us are only
                    wavering probabilities of events that we can only measure
                    with limited accuracy.

                    that there is a method that combines the above descriptions,

                    India's solar observation mission on Saturday entered the
                    Sun's orbit after a four-month journey, the latest success
                    for the space exploration ambitions of the world's most
                    populous nation.

                    The Aditya-L1 mission was launched in September and is
                    carrying an array of instruments to measure and observe the
                    Sun's outermost layers.

                  <p>
                    India's science and technology minister Jitendra Singh said
                    on social media that the probe had reached its final orbit
                    "to discover the mysteries of Sun-Earth connection".

                  <p>
                    [...] But the latest mission by the Indian Space Research
                    Organization is the first by any Asian nation to be placed
                    in orbit around the Sun.

                    [...] Aditya, named after a Hindu Sun deity, has traveled
                    1.5 million kilometers (932,000 miles) from the Earth—still
                    only one percent of the distance between humanity's home
                    planet and the star at the center of our solar system.

                    It is now at a point where the gravitational forces of both
                    celestial bodies cancel out, allowing it to remain in a
                    stable halo orbit around the Sun.

                    The orbiter, which reportedly cost $48 million, will study
                    coronal mass ejections, a periodic phenomenon that sees huge
                    discharges of plasma and magnetic energy from the Sun's
                    atmosphere.

                    [...] India has a comparatively low-budget space program,
                    but one that has grown considerably in size and momentum
                    since it first sent a probe to orbit the Moon in 2008.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In August last year, India became the first country to land
                    an uncrewed craft near the largely unexplored lunar south
                    pole, and just the fourth nation to land on the Moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    India became the first Asian nation to put a craft into
                    orbit around Mars in 2014, and it is slated to launch a
                    three-day crewed mission into Earth's orbit later this year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It also plans a joint mission with Japan to send another
                    probe to the Moon by 2025 and an orbital mission to Venus
                    within the next two years.

                    CES is about more than just the gadgets you hold in your
                    hand or sit at the desk to use. It's about the stuff in your
                    bathroom, too, which is why Kohler is using the annual trade
                    show to debut its latest in connected fixtures. The new
                    items include a new shower sprayer, a ventilation fan that
                    helps with humidity after a long shower, and my favorite,
                    the PureWash Bidet Seat with Google and Alexa built-in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The PureWash Bidet Seat is as standard as any other, but I
                    like that you can talk to it. It's heated, has adjustable
                    temperatures and water pressure, and comes in white or black
                    to match your bathroom style. It also features voice
                    activation via Amazon's Alexa or the Google Assistant. You
                    can use your voice to command the spray pressure and the air
                    dryer—it has a dryer! Ahhh, nice and warm.
                  </p>

                    [...] Kohler will have other fixtures on display at CES,
                    including the Rista, a 3D-printed sink. I also hope to
                    glimpse the new Anthem+ Smart Showering controls, which
                    offer remote access to lights, water, and sound through the
                    Kohler Konnect app.

                      Two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials have proved
                      to be very promising for the development of various
                      electronic devices, including wearables and smaller
                      electronics. These materials can have significant
                      advantages over their bulky counterparts, for instance
                      retaining their carrier mobility irrespective of their
                      reduced thickness.

                      Despite their promise for creating thin electronics, 2D
                      semiconductors have so far only rarely been used to create
                      monolayer transistors, thinner versions of the crucial
                      electronic components used to modulate and amplify
                      electrical current inside most existing devices. Most
                      proposed monolayer transistors based on 2D semiconductors
                      were created using a few carefully selected materials
                      known to have relatively stable lattice structures, such
                      as graphene, tungsten diselenide or molybdenum disulfide
                      (MoS2).

                      new monolayer transistors using alternative 2D

                      phosphorus and germanium arsenide—the fabrication of
                      monolayer transistors is challenging and is limited by the
                      difficulties in forming robust electrical contacts with
                      the delicate 2D materials," Wangying Li, Quanyang Tao and
                      their colleagues wrote in their paper. "We report the
                      fabrication of monolayer black phosphorus and germanium
                      arsenide transistors with three-dimensional raised
                      contacts using a van der Waals peeling technique."

                      The primary objective of the recent work by this team of
                      researchers was to create new transistors based on
                      monolayer 2D semiconductors beyond those that have so far
                      been primarily used in monolayer transistor designs. This
                      presents several challenges, as some of these materials
                      are difficult to scale down uniformly and without
                      compromising their intrinsic properties.

                      [...] Though the Romans consumed even more wine than we do
                      today, ancient vineyards in Italy looked radically
                      different from the typical landscape of rolling hillsides
                      covered by rows of tightly spaced vines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      [...] But the sophistication of the system goes much
                      further. By training vines to climb high—up to 15 or even
                      20 meters—the damage done by rising soil dampness was
                      further reduced, while the heating impact of the sun was
                      increased. This made grapes develop and mature better, as
                      long as the right balance between shade (from foliage) and
                      sun exposure was obtained. High climbing vines also have
                      deeper and more developed roots, which makes them more
                      resistant to rot caused by parasites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Examples in pre industrial Portugal also show that the
                      trees themselves even contribute to the microclimate of
                      the vineyard: they mitigate the impact of winter frosts,
                      offer protection against strong and damaging winds, and
                      reduce the distribution of unwanted seeds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Records show that vine agroforestery expanded massively
                      between the years 200 BC and 200 AD, during what is known
                      as the Roman Climate Optimum, a period of several
                      centuries of markedly warmer temperatures that coincided
                      with the expansion of the Roman Empire. This means that
                      Roman winemakers in Italy often operated under warmer and
                      more humid conditions than those experienced in much of
                      the 20th century.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      [...] Insights into Roman and pre-industrial practices
                      suggest that this approach may also help winemakers to
                      adapt to an ever-warming planet. It also begs the much
                      wider question of what else we can learn by looking to the
                      past as we confront an uncertain future.

                    On Monday, January 8, United Launch Alliance's Vulcan
                    Centaur could finally perform its first flight. ULA has been
                    a rock in the spaceflight industry since its founding in
                    2006, and with this pending launch, the company is ready to
                    take its next bold step into space. Here's how America's new
                    powerhouse rocket could disrupt the sector and compete with
                    the ever-dominant SpaceX.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Vulcan Centaur rocket, towering at 202 feet (61.6
                    meters), is scheduled for liftoff from Cape Canaveral's
                    Space Launch Complex-41. ULA, a collaboration between
                    Lockheed Martin Corporation and Boeing Company, hasn't
                    created a rocket that compares technologically to those
                    belonging to SpaceX, but it still represents a big
                    achievement for the company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Vulcan Centaur could make serious waves in the spaceflight

                      >ULA potentially matching SpaceX's lower launch prices</a
                    >, according to the Motley Fool. SpaceX, known for
                    revolutionizing space travel with affordable launches like
                    the $67 million Falcon 9, prompted ULA to respond with a
                    more affordable option. Vulcan, set to launch at under $100
                    million, marks a substantial cost reduction from the
                    company's $400 million Delta IV Heavy. This strategic
                    pricing means ULA can stay somewhat competitive,
                    demonstrated by its
                    <a

                  <p>
                    While this might mean lower revenues for Boeing and Lockheed
                    Martin, the Vulcan Centaur's cost-effectiveness could prove
                    beneficial in the long term. This development
                    signals—hopefully—a tightening competition in the space
                    launch sector. What's more, customers must weigh other
                    considerations beyond just launch costs, such as fairing
                    adaptability and the increasing issue of backlogs. Needless
                    to say, the introduction of SpaceX's Starship megarocket
                    could complicate the landscape for ULA, but only time will
                    tell.

                needed to reach a skill level where one can play as long as
                endurance and the software hold out. In his case it took over
                half an hour on the NES using rolling:

                    Blue Scuti is a Tetris prodigy who employs the "rolling"
                    controller technique, a new way of holding and using the NES
                    controller that was popularized in 2021. Rolling surpassed
                    "hyper tapping," which requires players to tap the
                    controller's D-pad 12 times per second, as the fastest and
                    best way of playing Tetris. Rolling is a method where
                    players roll their fingers on the bottom of an NES
                    controller and use that pressure to push the controller into
                    their other hand, which presses the D-pad to move the
                    blocks. With rolling, players can push the D-pad at least 20
                    times per second, which is fast enough to theoretically play
                    the game until it breaks. The technique has completely
                    revolutionized competitive Tetris over the last few years.
