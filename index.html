                    A group of researchers in the UK affiliated with the BSS
                    (British Sleep Society) published a
                    <a
                      href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsr.14352"
                      >paper</a
                    >
                    this week calling for the permanent abolition of Daylight
                    Saving Time (DST) and adherence to Greenwich Mean Time
                    (GMT), in large part because modern evidence suggests having
                    that extra hour of sunlight in the evenings is worse for our
                    health than we thought back in the 1970s when the concept
                    was all the rage in Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not only does GMT more closely align with the natural
                    day/light cycle in the UK, the boffins assert, but decades
                    of research into sleep and circadian rhythms have been
                    produced since DST was enacted that have yet to be
                    considered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The human circadian rhythm, the 24-hour cycle our bodies go
                    through, drives a lot about our health beyond sleep. It
                    regulates hormone release, gene expression, metabolism, mood
                    (who isn't grumpier when waking up in January?), and the
                    like. In short, it's important. Messing with that rhythm by
                    forcing ourselves out of bed earlier for several months out
                    of the year can have lasting effects, the researchers said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to their review of recent research, having light
                    trigger our circadian rhythms in the mornings to wake us up
                    is far more important than an extra hour of light in the
                    evenings. In fact, contrary to the belief that an extra hour
                    of light in the evenings is beneficial, it might actually
                    cause health problems by, again, mucking about with the
                    human body's understanding of what time it is and how we
                    ought to feel about it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Disruption of the daily synchronization of our body clocks
                    causes disturbances in our physiology and behavior … which
                    leads to negative short and long-term physical and mental
                    health outcomes," the authors said. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That, and we've just plain fooled ourselves into thinking it
                    benefits us in any real way.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    there is simply no spare daylight to save during the winter

                    morning and natural light in the afternoon, the scientific
                    evidence favors light in the morning."

                    The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has
                    finalized a rule that requires banks, credit card issuers,
                    and most other financial firms to provide consumers with
                    access to their personal financial data - and to help them
                    transfer it, generally at no cost.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the rule eventually takes effect – anywhere from 2026
                    to 2030 depending upon financial firm assets and revenue,
                    with the largest institutions having the least time to
                    comply – it aims to make financial services more competitive
                    by allowing consumers to move to different vendors more
                    easily.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under this "open banking" rule, covered financial firms:
                    "shall make available to a consumer, upon request,
                    information in the control or possession of the covered
                    person concerning the consumer financial product or service
                    that the consumer obtained from such covered person, subject
                    to certain exceptions."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This data has to be made available in an electronic form
                    usable by consumers and authorized third parties.

                    [...] "Too many Americans are stuck in financial products
                    with lousy rates and service," said CFPB director Rohit
                    Chopra in
                    <a

                    rates and service on bank accounts, credit cards, and more."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rule also outlines required privacy protections for
                    personal financial data, specifying that third parties can
                    only use data for a requested product or service.

                  <p>
                    "They cannot secretly collect, use, or retain consumers’
                    data for their own unrelated business reasons – for example,
                    by offering consumers a loan using consumer data that they
                    also use for targeted advertising," the CFPB said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rule prohibits data providers from making consumer data
                    available to third parties through screen scraping and it
                    requires that businesses delete consumer data when a person
                    revokes access.

                    Despite an official ban on Russian government workers using

                    government staff from using iPhones. Purportedly, it was
                    because the FSB believed the US was using the iPhone for
                    eavesdropping.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now according to <em>Reuters</em>, local Russian sources

                    the ban rather failed. While the figures have yet to be
                    confirmed by any other source, the
                    <em>Vedomosti</em> business daily claims that purchases of
                    iPhones from January 2024 to September would four times
                    higher year over year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] That rather dispels any idea that Russian officials
                    are rebelling against the ban en masse. But it also points
                    to how the original ban was seemingly far from a blanket
                    one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Equally, that destroys the idea that the FSB can be serious
                    in its allegations of iPhone wiretapping. It's always been
                    more likely that any ban is a retaliation for how Apple

                    Researchers at the University of Chicago and Argonne
                    National Lab have

                    a new type of optical memory that stores data by
                    transferring light from rare-earth element atoms embedded in
                    a solid material to nearby quantum defects. They
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.033170"
                      >published</a

                    their study in Physical Review Research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem that the researchers aim to solve is the
                    diffraction limit of light in standard CDs and DVDs. Current
                    optical storage has a hard cap on data density because each
                    single bit can't be smaller than the wavelength of the
                    reading/writing laser.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers propose bypassing this limit by stuffing the
                    material with rare-earth emitters, such as magnesium oxide
                    (MgO) crystals. The trick, called wavelength multiplexing,
                    involves having each emitter use a slightly different
                    wavelength of light. They theorized that this would allow
                    cramming far more data into the same storage footprint.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers first had to tackle the physics and model
                    all the requirements to build a proof of concept. They
                    simulated a theoretical solid material filled with
                    rare-earth atoms that absorb and re-emit light. The models
                    then showed how the nearby quantum defects could capture and
                    store the returned light.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the fundamental discoveries was that when a defect
                    absorbs the narrow wavelength energy from those nearby
                    atoms, it doesn't just get excited – its spin state flips.
                    Once it flips, it is nearly impossible to revert, meaning
                    those defects could legitimately store data for a long time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While it's a promising first step, some crucial questions
                    still need answers. For example, verifying how long those
                    excited states persist is essential. Details were also light
                    on capacity estimates – the scientists touted
                    "ultra-high-density" but didn't provide any projections
                    against current disc capacities. Yet, despite the remaining
                    hurdles, the researchers are hyped, calling it a "huge first
                    step."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, turning all this into an actual commercial
                    storage product will likely take years of additional
                    research and development.

                    [...] As of this writing, asking Google for the best steak,
                    steakhouse, or steak sandwich in London (or similar) isn't
                    generating an AI Overview result for me. But when I searched
                    for the best steak sandwich in London, the top result is
                    from Reddit, including a thread from four days ago titled
                    "Which Angus Steakhouse do you recommend for their steak
                    sandwich?" and one from two days ago titled "Had to see what
                    all the hype was about, best steak sandwich I've ever had!"
                    with a picture of an Angus Steakhouse.

                    [...] Again, at this point the Angus Steakhouse hype doesn't
                    appear to have made it into AI Overview. But it is appearing
                    in Search results. And while this is far from being a
                    dangerous attempt to manipulate search results or AI
                    algorithms, it does highlight the pitfalls of Google results
                    becoming dependent on content generated by users who could
                    very easily have intentions other than providing helpful
                    information. This is also far from the first time that
                    online users, including on platforms outside of Reddit, have
                    publicly declared plans to make inaccurate or misleading
                    posts in an effort to thwart AI scrapers.

                    answered, in part, that the source of AI is "actual
                    intelligence," and that "there's a general lowering of
                    quality on the internet because more content is written by
                    AI. But I think that actually makes Reddit stand out more as
                    the place where there's all of this human content. What

                    Not all winged dinosaurs were necessarily capable of full

                    Tiny tracks in South Korea symbolise a moment 120 million
                    years ago when a dinosaur took advantage of its wings to
                    cover ground in large leaps – the oldest track evidence of
                    wing-assisted movement in these extinct

                    Whether the creature, which was a raptor and not part of the
                    lineage that led to birds, took full flight is uncertain.
                    But the tracks support previous ideas that aerodynamics
                    evolved multiple times across prehistoric lines, says

                    “It’s pretty rare to find these kinds of [pre-flight]
                    tracks, and then to find them in an animal that’s not even a
                    bird – that’s pretty special,” he says.

                    Velociraptors and other raptors (dromaeosaurids) are the
                    ancestors of modern birds, but their lineage split into
                    avian and non-avian, or “paravian”, lines about 170 million
                    years ago. Despite having feathers and wings, paravian
                    dinosaurs generally seemed to lack the wingspan needed to
                    offset their body weight, says team member

                    >, or at least glide, before full flight evolved in birds,
                    based on muscles in their upper bodies. That suspicion grew
                    stronger as they investigated more than 2600 rows of
                    dinosaur tracks around the world.

                  <p>
                    One set of tracks, discovered during the construction of a
                    shopping centre in south-eastern South Korea, showed
                    surprisingly long spacing
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35289-4"

                  <p>
                    [...] Further calculations and comparisons with fossil
                    anatomy suggested he was right: the animal could not have
                    made that stride with its legs alone. It was clearly
                    flapping or gliding, possibly while launching or landing,
                    says Pittman.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “I think the vast majority of feathered dinosaurs were
                    probably doing what this guy was doing – using the wings to
                    augment running, jumping, braking and turning,” says
                    Pittman.

                    [...] In September, Ono and two collaborators — William
                    Craig and Jan-Willem van Ittersum — published
                    <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2409417121"
                      >yet another application</a
                    >
                    for partition identities. Rather than looking for a new
                    source from which these identities would spring, they were
                    able to use them for an entirely different purpose: to
                    detect prime numbers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They took functions that counted partitions and used them to
                    build a special formula. When you plug any prime number into
                    this equation, it spits out zero. When you plug in any other
                    number, it instead spits out a positive number. In this way,
                    the partition identities can give you a way to pick out the
                    entire set of primes from the integers, Ono said. “Isn’t
                    that crazy?”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Partitions are about adding and counting,” he said. “Why
                    would they be able to detect which numbers are prime or not,
                    on the nose, which is a multiplication thing?”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By tapping into the rich mathematical theory of
                    <a
                      href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/behold-modular-forms-the-fifth-fundamental-operation-of-math-20230921/"
                      >modular forms</a
                    >, he and his colleagues found that this formula was just a
                    glimpse of a much larger class of prime-detecting functions
                    — infinitely many, in fact. “That’s mind-blowing to me,” Ono
                    said. “I hope people find it beautiful.” It indicates a
                    deeper relation between the partitions and multiplicative
                    number theory that mathematicians are now hoping to explore.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In some ways, it makes sense that partitions keep
                    infiltrating every corner of mathematics. “The theory of
                    partitions is so basic,” Andrews said. “Counting stuff and
                    adding stuff up happens in almost every branch of
                    mathematics.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the precise nature of those connections is hard to
                    work out. “It’s really about getting the perspective right,”
                    Ono said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “This is the great thing about Ramanujan’s work,” Kanade
                    said. “It’s not just one identity he discovered, and a dead
                    end. It’s always the tip of an iceberg. You just have to
                    follow it through.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Ramanujan is someone who can imagine things that someone
                    like me cannot,” Mourtada said. But the development of new
                    fields of mathematics has “given us the possibility to find
                    new partition identities that Ramanujan could probably have
                    found just by imagination.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “That’s why mathematics is so important,” he added. “It
                    allows ordinary people like me to find these miracles, too.”

                    T-Mobile and AT&amp;T say US regulators should drop a plan
                    to require unlocking of phones within 60 days of activation,
                    claiming that locking phones to a carrier's network makes it
                    possible to provide cheaper handsets to consumers. "If the

                    "consumers risk losing access to the benefits of free or
                    heavily subsidized handsets because the proposal would force

                    Scientists in China have created a mind-bogglingly powerful
                    resistive magnet that has officially broken the world record
                    by sustaining an incredible 42.02 tesla. That is over
                    800,000 times stronger than the magnetic field produced by
                    Earth itself, which has a flux density of about 50
                    microtesla.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new record was set on September 22 at the Steady High
                    Magnetic Field Facility (SHMFF) in Hefei, narrowly edging
                    out the previous record of 41.4 tesla held by another
                    resistive magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Lab in
                    Florida since 2017.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for why scientists are so determined to push the limits
                    of magnetism, physicist Joachim Wosnitza from Germany's
                    Dresden lab
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03382-6"
                      >explained</a
                    >
                    that it opens up all kinds of bizarre new realms of physics
                    to explore. Essentially, the stronger the magnetism, the
                    greater the chances of discovering new states of matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another physicist noted that high magnetism allows
                    scientists to engineer and manipulate entirely new phases of
                    matter that simply don't exist under normal conditions. Each
                    additional tesla achieved also makes instruments
                    exponentially more sensitive for detecting faint phenomena.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The SHMFF's new champion is available for international
                    researchers to test on advanced materials like
                    superconductors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The only drawback of such resistive magnetic systems is that
                    they are real power hogs. The SHMFF's creation consumed a
                    staggering 32.3 megawatts to achieve that record. However,
                    scientists continue to use them because they can sustain
                    high magnetic fields much longer than their newer
                    superconducting counterparts, which eventually reach their
                    limits. The older magnets can also be ramped up quickly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nonetheless, the enormous power requirements are a
                    significant problem. Therefore, teams like those at the
                    SHMFF are also working on hybrid and fully superconducting
                    designs that could achieve extreme strengths while consuming
                    much less energy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is not to say that hybrid or superconducting designs
                    are less powerful than resistive magnetic systems. In fact,
                    China debuted a hybrid resistive/superconducting magnet in
                    2022 that achieved a 45.22 tesla field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the other side of the world, the US National Lab's mini
                    superconducting prototype managed a brief 45.5 tesla burst
                    back in 2019. However, making these new low-power systems
                    reliable and affordable – while also keeping them cool –
                    remains a major technical challenge, underscoring the
                    continued need for resistive magnets.

                Moving the data from a live server to a new server means that
                there will be a finite time between making a backup and
                installing it on the new server. The site will indicate that
                maintenance is being carried out. That implies that posts made
                during this interval will be lost. The process will begin around
                1600 UTC on Monday 28 October. We will attempt to make the
                switch over as quickly as possible and there should always be a
                live server online. If you lose access to the site completely
                remember that you can still contact us via email ('nickname' [@]
                soylentnews.org), on IRC, or by shouting VERY loudly.

                If your comment is lost please do not believe those in the
                community who will no doubt claim that comments are being
                intentionally deleted. They are not (unless you are one of our
                small number of persistent spammers).
              </p>
              <p>
                Once each switch is completed I would hope that we can inform
                you immediately. However, that might not always be possible -
                everyone has to sleep sometime! Please make any observations
                regarding problems, or even compliments if the system is
                responding better than before, in the comments for this Meta.
                However, our testing so far indicates that the new servers are
                more responsive than the existing servers but of course they
                have not yet been placed under quite the same load.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>UPDATE</b>: You should all be accessing the new server.
                Please let us know if you experience any problems. A big
                thank-you to kolie!.

                    For the first time ever, a well-known auction house is
                    selling an artwork that was painted by a robot. Sotheby's
                    will be auctioning off the portrait of scientist Alan Turing
                    and it could fetch as much as £150,000.

                Ultra-realistic? Looks more like someone got lost in the uncanny
                valley, or got very poor taste in women. It's apparently
                important to note that it is a (or resembles) human female. Not
                one of those disgusting manbots artistic AI fueled robots. How
                does female robots differ from male robots anyway? 0s or 1s ?

                Since it was founded nearly two decades ago, 23andMe has grown
                into one of the largest biotechnology companies in the world.
                Millions of people have used its simple genetic testing service,
                which involves ordering a saliva test, spitting into a tube, and
                sending it back to the company for a detailed DNA analysis.

                    Mozilla is reminding Firefox users that a necessary root
                    certificate
                    <a
                      href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/root-certificate-expiration"

                    soon and that older browser versions could become a security
                    and usability nightmare in a few months. Starting March 14,
                    2025, Firefox versions older than 128 (ESR 115.13)
                    containing the expired certificate will likely cause
                    "significant" issues with add-ons, content signing, and
                    streaming of DRM-protected media.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Failing to update Firefox before next March means losing
                    features relying on remote functionality. Many installed
                    add-ons will become disabled, and other systems that require
                    content verification could also break. The issue
                    <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/welcome/19/"

                    Firefox editions for Android and Windows operating systems,
                    including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Those with iPhone or
                    iPad versions of Firefox should be okay.

                  <p>
                    Mozilla's FAQs explain that a root certificate authenticates
                    browser content as trusted. When a certificate expires,
                    Firefox cannot verify content anymore. The newest versions
                    of Firefox and other Mozilla software using the same
                    root-of-trust model include a new root certificate that will
                    prevent the expiration issue in March 2025.

                    Mozilla is likely trying to prevent the chaos experienced by
                    Firefox users in 2019 when an expired certificate suddenly

                    than five years ago, but we're still talking about millions
                    of users potentially becoming vulnerable to the expiration
                    issue.

                    Some add-on developers have expressed concern over how
                    Mozilla is managing the problem. One developer said Firefox
                    should clearly

                    >
                    what could happen on all the affected platforms. Otherwise,
                    disgruntled users could direct their complaints directly to
                    add-on programmers. One-star review bombing campaigns after
                    the certificate expires could also be part of the deal.

                  <p>
                    Mozilla advises users to update to Firefox 128 on each
                    device with the browser installed, which is the best
                    practice to avoid this and other issues. The latest release
                    always provides significant performance improvements and
                    important security fixes. Mozilla released Firefox 128 and
                    ESR 115.13 on July 9, 2024, so there have been minor
                    incremental updates since then. The most

                    The final rule adopted by Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden
                    was based on recommendations made by Shira Perlmutter, the
                    register of copyrights and director of the US Copyright
                    Office. The ruling came in the ninth triennial proceeding to
                    determine exemptions under Section 1201 of the Digital
                    Millennium Copyright Act. The process provides exemptions
                    for the next three years to "the prohibition against
                    circumvention of technological measures that effectively
                    control access to copyrighted works."

                    sufficiently showed, by a preponderance of the evidence,

                Opposition to the change came from McDonalds corporate and the

                    activity and enable businesses to better serve their
                    customers," Rose said. "While we are disappointed that the
                    Register recommended a narrower exemption than we had
                    proposed, this does not soften our enthusiasm. We will
                    continue to chip away at half-baked laws blocking the right
                    to repair, sprinkling consumer victories as we go. Today's
                    win may not be parfait, but it's still pretty sweet."

                    There are multiple settings that phone users must choose to
                    close off the constant leaking of their locations. For users
                    of either Android or iOS, the first step is to audit which
                    apps currently have permission to access the device
                    location. This can be done on Android by accessing Settings
                    &gt; Location &gt; App location permissions and, on iOS,
                    Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services.

                    For most users, there's usefulness in allowing an app for
                    photos, transit, or maps to access a user's precise
                    location. For other classes of apps—say those for Internet
                    jukeboxes at bars and restaurants—it can be helpful for them
                    to have an approximate location, but giving them precise,
                    fine-grained access is likely overkill. And for other apps,
                    there's no reason for them ever to know the device's
                    location. With a few exceptions, there's little reason for
                    apps to always have location access.

                    Not surprisingly, Android users who want to block intrusive
                    location gathering have more settings to change than iOS
                    users. The first thing to do is access Settings &gt;
                    Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Ads and choose "Delete
                    advertising ID." Then, promptly ignore the long, scary
                    warning Google provides and hit the button confirming the
                    decision at the bottom. If you don't see that setting, good
                    for you. It means you already deleted it. Google provides

                    "Very few Yugoslavians had access to computers in the early
                    1980s: they were mostly the preserve of large institutions
                    or companies. Importing home computers like the Commodore 64
                    was not only expensive, but also legally impossible, thanks
                    to a law that restricted regular citizens from importing
                    individual goods that were worth more than 50 Deutsche Marks
                    (the Commodore 64 cost over 1,000 Deutsche Marks at launch).
                    Even if someone in Yugoslavia could afford the latest home
                    computers, they would have to resort to smuggling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1983, engineer Vojislav "Voja" Antonić was becoming more
                    and more frustrated with the senseless Yugoslavian import
                    laws.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Antonić was pondering this while on holiday with his wife in
                    Risan in Montenegro in 1983. "I was thinking how would it be
                    possible to make the simplest and cheapest possible
                    computer," says Antonić. "As a way to amuse myself in my
                    free time. That's it. Everyone thinks it is an interesting
                    story, but really I was just bored!" He wondered whether it
                    would be possible to make a computer without a graphics chip
                    – or a "video controller" as they were commonly known at the
                    time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead of having a separate graphics chip, Antonić thought
                    he could use part of the CPU to generate a video signal, and
                    then replicate some of the other video functions using
                    software. It would mean sacrificing processing power, but in
                    principle it was possible, and it would make the computer
                    much cheaper."

                    German air-taxi developer Lilium said on Thursday two of its
                    subsidiaries in the country have decided to file for
                    insolvency following unsuccessful talks with state and
                    federal governments to solve its cash crisis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company's U.S.-listed shares fell 57% to 23 cents after
                    the subsidiaries - Lilium GmbH and Lilium eAircraft GmbH -
                    told the parent they are over-indebted and will be unable to
                    pay debts over the coming days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lilium is now "reviewing whether there are grounds for its
                    own insolvency as well," it said in a regulatory filing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company, among a handful of air-taxi makers that are
                    seeking to upend urban travel, was staring at a cash crunch
                    as it is still developing aircraft that is yet to receive
                    approval to carry passengers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lilium had asked the German federal government to guarantee
                    50 million euros ($54 million) of a contemplated 100 million
                    euro convertible loan from KfW, the German state-owned
                    development bank.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the company received indications that the federal
                    government would not approve it, Lilium said. Talks with
                    Bavaria, where Lilium is based, for guarantee of at least 50
                    million euros have not yielded an agreement so far.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The filing for insolvency in Germany could result in the
                    company's ordinary shares being delisted from the Nasdaq, or
                    having its shares suspended, Lilium said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Founded in 2015, Lilium is targeting the regional transport
                    market with a 250 kilometer-range (155 miles) jet that can
                    carry up to six passengers, unlike many rivals which are
                    mainly looking at shorter trips between cities and suburbs.

                    A long-lost story from Bram Stoker, the Irish author of one
                    of the world's best known gothic horror stories 'Dracula',
                    has been found in Dublin.

                    In a remarkable discovery, the short story by Stoker, has

                If it was printed, and then forgotten about (or lost) for 130
                years. How good can it really be? This is around the time he
                also wrote 'Dracula'. Considering it was a bit of a hit it seems
                odd that his other writing was then lost. Did they work contrary
                to how writers work today that if they make one hit then all
                their other writings become "gold" and are reprinted or
                rereleased etc etc.

                    [...] this new twist belongs to one county in Texas, which
                    has given certain people the power to unilaterally decide
                    what is or isn't factual.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        [A] decision made this month in a county near Houston
                        left us stunned. The Montgomery County Commissioners
                        Court ordered librarians there to reclassify the
                        nonfiction children's book "Colonization and the
                        Wampanoag Story" as fiction.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        This reclassification decision is a consequence of a
                        contentious policy change in March. Right-wing activists
                        pressured the Montgomery County Commissioners Court to
                        remove librarians from the review process for challenged
                        children's, young adult and parenting books.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        [...] Shortly thereafter, the newly formed Montgomery
                        County "Citizens Review Committee" reclassified
                        "Colonization and the Wampanoag Story" as fiction. The
                        committee reviewed the book in a closed meeting — all
                        its meetings are closed to the public — and it offered
                        no explanation for its decision. The new policy does not
                        allow decisions made by the Citizens Review Committee to
                        be appealed.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    That's how you start erasing your own history. You take the
                    librarians out of the equation. Next, you remove the public
                    from the conversation by making these discussions private.
                    Then you give only the citizens you want to hear from —
                    including any non-residents who want to challenge content
                    they don't like — the only invitation to the discussion: the
                    blanket permission to challenge books and/or their
                    classifications. Then you seal it with a court order and
                    pretend this is just citizens protecting each other, rather
                    than the government engaging in censorship on behalf of
                    people who love censorship as long as it only silences the
                    people they don't like.

                    The challenges don't stop there. Hertz's heavy debt load is
                    tying its hands, potentially forcing the company to navigate
                    choppy waters without the lifeline of share buybacks. With
                    used-vehicle prices on shaky ground and high refinancing
                    costs, Hertz is bracing for more cash outflows. Throw in a
                    recent adverse court ruling that resurrected litigation
                    risks from its bankruptcy, and the financial landscape looks
                    even more daunting. The path to stability isn't just steep;
                    it's laden with obstacles.

                    But it's not just China making moves. The US semiconductor
                    industry, propped up by the Inflation Reduction Act, saw its
                    own patent filings rise by 9 percent, reaching 21,269 in
                    2023-24. With US policies pouring cash into domestic chip
                    production – TSMC's Arizona plant being one high-profile
                    example – the US is keen to keep its supply chain fortified
                    while ramping up its R&amp;D efforts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's not clear whether the current patent push will result
                    in feature parity or processor independence for China in the
                    next several years. Both the US and China are seeking to
                    bring fabrication of sub-10nm nodes to their own turf, and
                    the US Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) predicted in
                    a report out earlier this year that the US would be a bigger
                    winner by far. SIA
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/08/us_china_sia/"
                      >predicted</a
                    >
                    that by 2032, the US would produce 28 percent of the world's
                    advanced processors, compared to just 2 percent from China.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    China's patent surge isn't solely driven by geopolitics. The
                    rise of AI, and particularly the explosion of generative AI,
                    has sparked a push to innovate in semiconductor design. AI
                    accelerators and high-performance chips are hot commodities,
                    and chipmakers everywhere are scrambling to file patents for
                    the next big thing in AI hardware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So while global semiconductor patents are on the rise,
                    China's 42 percent leap is an indication that it's gunning
                    for self-sufficiency. But as the US shores up its own
                    chipmaking prowess, the race is on – and it's only set to
                    intensify if current trends are anything to go by. ®

                About a dozen developers based in Russia have been removed in a

                Controversial Linux VLogger Bryan Lunduke reports that this has
                happened due to US presidential executive order 14071, which
                sanctions IT collaborations with Russian residents (<a

                Linus himself backed the actions, The Register quotes him with
                "I'm Finnish. Did you think I'd be *supporting* Russian
                aggression?"

                This will likely have far reaching consequences, going vastly
                beyond the Linux kernel, with any FLOSS organization in the US
                or under direct US influence having to ban Russian contributors
                before the end of the year.

                    [...] <br />The main evidence presented by Hoback in support
                    of the theory that Todd created Bitcoin is a forum thread
                    from December 2010 in which Todd appears to be "finishing
                    Satoshi's sentences," as Hoback puts it. The topic of that
                    thread—a way to prioritize transactions based on the fee
                    paid—is something Todd would later go on to build into
                    Bitcoin as a contributing developer, responding to a request
                    posted by another forum user, John Dillon, whom Hoback
                    alleges to be another of Todd's alter egos.<br />[...]<br />It
                    was Todd's reaction to being confronted with the theory that
                    ultimately solidified Hoback's conviction in the conclusion
                    he had reached. "The end scene is really about his body
                    language—his expressions. Were you ever caught in a lie?
                    That's what Peter's reaction reads like to me," says
                    Hoback.<br />[...]<br />"[Todd] throws so much shit at the
                    wall that nothing sticks," alleges Hoback. "It's a pretty
                    effective technique—it's hard to pin down someone who's a
                    contrarian and constantly makes opposite statements." (Todd
                    rejects Hoback's assessment as "wooly conspiracy
                    thinking.")<br />[...]<br />"If you assume a sophisticated
                    enough Satoshi, practically any theory is possible," says
                    Todd. "It's a useless question, because Satoshi would simply
                    deny it."

                    Police use of automated license-plate reader cameras is
                    being challenged in a lawsuit alleging that the cameras
                    enable warrantless surveillance in violation of the Fourth
                    Amendment. The city of Norfolk, Virginia, was sued yesterday
                    by plaintiffs represented by the Institute for Justice, a
                    nonprofit public-interest law firm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Norfolk, a city with about 238,000 residents, "has installed
                    a network of cameras that make it functionally impossible
                    for people to drive anywhere without having their movements
                    tracked, photographed, and stored in an AI-assisted database
                    that enables the warrantless surveillance of their every
                    move. This civil rights lawsuit seeks to end this dragnet
                    surveillance program," said the complaint filed in US
                    District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like many other cities, Norfolk uses cameras made by the
                    company Flock Safety. A 404 Media article said Institute for
                    Justice lawyer Robert Frommer "told 404 Media that the
                    lawsuit could have easily been filed in any of the more than
                    5,000 communities where Flock is active, but that Norfolk
                    made sense because the Fourth Circuit of Appeals—which
                    Norfolk is part of—recently held that persistent,
                    warrantless drone surveillance in Baltimore is
                    unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment in a case called
                    Beautiful Struggle v Baltimore Police Department."

                    least of which is the generation time of Proboscideans,
                    these other efforts may reach many critical milestones well
                    in advance of the work on mammoths.<br />[...]<br />Colossal
                    has branched out from its original de-extinction mission to
                    include efforts to keep species from ever needing its
                    services. In the case of marsupial predators, the
                    de-extinction effort is incorporating work that will benefit
                    existing marsupial predators: generating resistance to the
                    toxins found on the cane toad, an invasive species that has
                    spread widely across Australia.<br />[...]<br />For the
                    de-extinction process, the goal would be to ensure that the
                    thylacine could survive in the presence of the cane toad.
                    But Colossal has also begun a conservation effort, called
                    the Colossal foundation, that aims to keep threatened
                    species from needing its services in the future.<br />[...]<br />Colossal
                    has obtained a nearly complete genome sequence from a
                    thylacine sample that was preserved in ethanol a bit over a
                    century ago. According to Pask, this sample contains both
                    the short fragments typical of older DNA samples (typically
                    just a few hundred base pairs long), but also some DNA
                    molecules that were above 10,000 bases long. This allowed
                    them to do both short- and long-read sequencing, leaving
                    them with just 45 gaps in the total genome sequence, which
                    the team expects to close shortly.<br />[...]<br />The final
                    thing the company announced was that it was working on
                    getting dunnart embryos to develop outside of the womb.<br />[...]<br />At
                    this point, they've got immature neural cells and have
                    started forming the cells that will go on to form muscles
                    and the vertebrae. But many critical events need to happen
                    in the remaining one-third of the pregnancy, and Colossal
                    isn't ready to talk about what goes wrong to stop
                    development here.<br />[...]<br />Hopefully, over time, the
                    company will continue to submit some of its work to
                    peer-reviewed journals.

                    In the meantime, the clear indications of progress suggest
                    that some of the unique features of the
                    marsupials—relatively rapid generation times, accessible
                    reproductive system, and many similarities to well-studied
                    placental mammals—are helping this project move ahead at a
                    reasonably rapid clip.

                    — a task that quantum computers can do that a classical one
                    would struggle with. Usually, researchers understand quantum
                    advantage to mean that a quantum computer can do the task in
                    far fewer steps.

                  <p>
                    The new papers show that quantum memory lets a quantum
                    computer perform a task not necessarily with fewer steps,
                    but with less data. As a result, researchers believe this in
                    itself could be a way to prove quantum advantage. “It allows
                    us to, in the more near term, already achieve that kind of
                    quantum advantage,” said

                    But researchers are excited about the practical benefits
                    too, as the new results make it easier for researchers to
                    understand complex quantum systems.

                    >, owners of robot vacuums across multiple U.S. states
                    experienced invasive hacking of their devices by individuals
                    who took physical control of the cleaning bots and used
                    their internal audio features to shout racial slurs at
                    people in their homes. Owners first heard garbled voices
                    coming from their devices, then noticed the vacuum's live
                    feed camera and remote controls were turned on via the
                    device's app.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All of the affected devices were manufactured by brand
                    Ecovac, specifically the company's Deebot X2 model. The hack
                    was confirmed to one customer after they filed a complaint
                    through customer support.

                    Smart devices have long worried security experts and users
                    for their potential vulnerabilities. In August, cyber
                    security researchers uncovered multiple vulnerabilities in
                    Ecovacs products (including lawn mowers) that could allow
                    hackers to take control of microphones and cameras via
                    mobile Bluetooth connections — to put it simply, researchers
                    concluded the company's security was "really, really,
                    really, really bad."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Design elements intended to protect users, like an audio
                    alert that lets individuals know the vacuum's camera is on,
                    could be easily switched off.

                    Intel had a solution ready to add 64-bit features to the
                    "classic" 32-bit x86 ISA, but the company chose to push
                    forward with the Itanium operation instead. A new snippet of
                    technology history has recently emerged from a year-old
                    Quora discussion. Intel's former "chief x86 architect," Bob

                    AMD engineer Phil Park was

                    the history behind the x86-64 transition, when he discovered
                    the conversation. Colwell revealed that Intel had an
                    inactive internal version of the x86-64 ISA embedded in
                    Pentium 4 chips. The company's management forced the
                    engineering team to "fuse off" the features.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The functionality was there, but users could not access it.
                    Intel decided to focus on the 64-bit native architecture
                    developed for Itanium instead of x86-64. The company felt
                    that a 64-bit Pentium 4 would have damaged Itanium's chances
                    to win the PC market. Management allegedly told Colwell "not
                    once, but twice" to stop going on about 64-bits on x86 if he
                    wanted to keep his job.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The engineer decided to compromise, leaving the logic gates
                    related to x86-64 features "hidden" in the hardware design.
                    Colwell bet that Intel would need to chase after AMD and
                    quickly implement its version of the x86-64 ISA, and he was
                    right. Itanium CPUs had no native backward compatibility
                    with 16-bit and 32-bit x86 software, so the architecture was
                    one of the worst commercial (and technology)

                    [...] Bob Colwell made significant contributions to Intel's
                    history, managing the development of popular PC CPUs such as
                    Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, and Pentium 4 before
                    retiring in 2000. Meanwhile, today's x86 chips marketed by
                    Intel and AMD still retain full backward hardware

                    A new concept from Hyundai's parts division, Hyundai Mobis,
                    developed in partnership with optics specialists Zeiss, aims
                    to transform your entire windshield into one massive
                    display. Dubbed the "Holographic Windshield Display," it
                    takes the modest head-up displays we've seen for decades and
                    dramatically expands their scope.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rather than just projecting basic information like speed or
                    turn-based directions onto a small part of the windshield,
                    this system envisions menus, apps, videos, and even games
                    spanning the full width of the glass in front of you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the concept render shown, there's no central touchscreen
                    – everything is displayed on the windshield. This suggests
                    that voice and gesture controls will likely be the primary
                    input methods, since you can't exactly reach out and touch
                    your windshield.
                  </p>

                    the technology as "navigation and driving information
                    unfolding like a panorama across the wide, transparent
                    windshield" in its press release. Meanwhile, passengers
                    could watch movies or video call friends, who appear as
                    holograms on the glass.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To prevent distractions, what's displayed to the driver
                    would differ from what passengers see. For example, the
                    driver may only see directions and essential info, while
                    passengers could binge-watch their favorite shows.

                    Last week, the California Coastal Commission rejected a plan
                    for SpaceX to launch up to 50 rockets this year at the
                    Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County. The
                    company responded yesterday with a lawsuit, alleging that
                    the state agency's denial was overreaching its authority and
                    discriminating against its CEO.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Commission's goal is to protect California's coasts and
                    beaches, as well as the animals living in them. The agency
                    has control over private companies' requests to use the
                    state coastline, but it can't deny activities by federal
                    departments. The denied launch request was actually made by
                    the US Space Force on behalf of SpaceX, asking that the
                    company be allowed to launch 50 of its Falcon 9 rockets, up
                    from 36.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the commissioners did raise
                    <a

                    about SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's political screed and the spotty
                    safety records at his companies during their review of the
                    launch request, the assessment focused on the relationship
                    between SpaceX and Space Force. The Space Force case is that
                    "because it is a customer of — and reliant on — SpaceX’s
                    launches and satellite network, SpaceX launches are a
                    federal agency activity," the Commission
                    <a
                      href="https://documents.coastal.ca.gov/reports/2024/10/Th9a/Th9a-10-2024-report.pdf"

                    >
                    stated. "However, this does not align with how federal
                    agency activities are defined in the Coastal Zone Management
                    Act’s regulations or the manner in the Commission has
                    historically implemented those regulations." The California
                    Coastal Commission claimed that at least 80 percent of the
                    SpaceX rockets contain payloads for Musk's Starlink company
                    rather than payloads for government clients.

                    The SpaceX suit filed with the Central District of
                    California court is seeking an order to designate the
                    launches as federal activity, which would cut the
                    Commission's oversight out of its future launch plans.

                    As Intel struggles with a falling stock price and revenue
                    failing to meet expectations, there were reports last month
                    that Qualcomm had

                  <p>
                    According to people familiar with the matter who spoke to

                      href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-15/qualcomm-said-to-wait-for-us-election-to-decide-intel-move"
                      >Bloomberg</a
                    >, Qualcomm has decided to wait until after the election
                    before deciding its next move. Such a massive deal would
                    undoubtedly face intense scrutiny from regulators, both
                    domestic and globally. The company wants to see how the next
                    administration's policies affect factors that could impact
                    the acquisition, such as antitrust rules and US-China
                    relations.

                  <p>
                    China is an important market for both Qualcomm and Intel. In
                    the same month that it first approached Intel, Qualcomm met
                    with antitrust regulators in China to gauge any potential
                    response to the deal. The company hasn't received any
                    feedback from Chinese authorities, who are apparently
                    waiting to see if Qualcomm makes a formal offer for Intel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the US, where Intel is the key player in the government's
                    plan to reignite the country's domestic chip manufacturing
                    industry, White House support for the deal would be crucial.

                  <p>
                    Intel is set to become the biggest beneficiary of the Chips
                    act, receiving $8.5 billion in grants as well as $11 billion
                    in low-interest loans, provided it proceeds with its factory
                    construction plans. It's been six months since the
                    government announced the award and Intel is still

                    for the funding. Qualcomm has been in discussions with US
                    regulators and believes that an all-American merger could
                    alleviate any concerns, according to the report.

                    "Factoring a 50-bit number using a hybrid quantum-classical
                    approach is a far cry from breaking 'military-grade

                    While advancements have indeed been made, the progress

                    breakthrough that renders current cryptographic systems

                    "This kind of overstatement does more harm than good," Dr.

                    'breaking military-grade encryption' is not just
                    inaccurate—it's potentially damaging to the field's

                    The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) has
                    discovered the largest known prime number,
                    2<sup>136,279,841</sup>-1, having 41,024,320 decimal digits.
                    Luke Durant, from San Jose, California, found the prime on
                    October 12th.

                    The new prime number, also known as M136279841, is
                    calculated by multiplying together 136,279,841 twos, and
                    then subtracting 1. It is over 16 million digits larger than
                    the previous record prime number, in a special class of
                    extremely rare prime numbers known as Mersenne primes. It is
                    only the 52nd known Mersenne prime ever discovered, each
                    increasingly more difficult to find. Mersenne primes were
                    named for the French monk Marin Mersenne, who studied these
                    numbers more than 350 years ago. GIMPS, founded in 1996, has
                    discovered the last 18 Mersenne primes. Volunteers download
                    a free program to search for these primes, with a $3000
                    award offered to anyone lucky enough to find a new prime.
                    Prof. Chris Caldwell founded an authoritative web site on
                    the largest known primes which is now maintained by
                    volunteers, and has an excellent history of Mersenne primes.

                    If you have ever been on the receiving end of a paper cut,
                    you will know how painful they can be.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To find out why paper is so successful at cutting
                    skin, Jensen and fellow DTU colleagues carried out over 50
                    experiments with a range of paper thicknesses to make
                    incisions into a piece of gelatine at various angles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Through these experiments and modelling,
                    <a
                      href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.110.025003"
                      >they discovered</a
                    >
                    that paper cuts are a competition between slicing and
                    "buckling". Thin paper with a thickness of about 30 microns,
                    or 0.03 mm, doesn't cut so well because it buckles – a
                    mechanical instability that happens when a slender object
                    like paper is compressed. Once this occurs, the paper can no
                    longer transfer force to the tissue, so is unable to cut.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thick paper, with a thickness greater than around 200
                    microns, is also ineffective at making an incision. This is
                    because it distributes the load over a greater area,
                    resulting in only small indentations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team found, however, a paper cut "sweet spot" at around
                    65 microns and when the incision was made at an angle of
                    about 20 degrees from the surface. This paper thickness just
                    happens to be close to that of the paper used in print
                    magazines, which goes some way to explain why it annoyingly
                    happens so often.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] ensen notes that the findings are interesting for two
                    reasons. "First, it's a new case of soft-on-soft
                    interactions where the deformation of two objects
                    intertwines in a non-trivial way," he says. "Traditional
                    metal knives are much stiffer than biological tissues, while
                    paper is still stiffer than skin but around 100 times weaker
                    than steel."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second is that it is a "great way" to teach students
                    about forces given that the experiments are straightforward
                    to do in the classroom. "Studying the physics of paper cuts
                    has revealed a surprising potential use for paper in the
                    digital age: not as a means of information dissemination and
                    storage, but rather as a tool of destruction," the
                    researchers write.

                    a rather insightful glimpse into the rise of mass timber and
                    its benefits. The technique basically uses massive
                    engineered wood elements instead of concrete and steel to
                    build higher than ever before. As of 2024, mass timber
                    buildings have climbed to almost unbelievable heights, with
                    the 25-story Ascent tower in Milwaukee leading the pack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The building is far from the only one in the category. The
                    report states that there were 84 completed or
                    under-construction mass timber buildings of eight stories or
                    higher worldwide by 2022, with another 55 proposed. Europe
                    dominates with 70% of these, but North America is catching
                    up with around 20%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for what's driving this wooden renaissance, there are
                    multiple reasons. For starters, mass timber could be an
                    answer for reducing concrete and steel's massive carbon
                    footprint, which alone makes up a whopping 15% of global
                    emissions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But what about issues like raw strength and fire
                    resistance, which have historically held wooden buildings
                    back? Well, mass timber uses elements like cross-laminated
                    timber (CLT) panels that can match steel's strength
                    pound-for-pound, thanks to layering and high-pressure gluing
                    techniques.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Modern mass timber also passes rigorous fire testing. In the
                    event of a fire, a protective char layer forms on the wood's
                    surface, insulating the interior from flames long enough for
                    evacuation and firefighter response.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Likely taking these perks into account, a 2021 update to the
                    International Building Code gave mass timber a huge vote of
                    confidence, allowing such constructions up to 18 stories in
                    many places.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, moisture poses risks that need careful management
                    to prevent fungus and pests. But proponents are confident
                    mass timber can be a sustainable solution if done right.

                    The CSAC also accused Intel of embedding a backdoor "in
                    almost all" of its CPUs since 2008 as part of a
                    "next-generation security defense system" developed by the
                    US National Security Agency.

                    This allowed Uncle Sam to "build an ideal monitoring
                    environment where only the NSA is protected and everyone
                    else is 'naked,'" the post continued. "This poses a huge
                    security threat to the critical information infrastructure
                    of countries around the world, including China," the
                    industry group claims.

                    The infosec org also recommends the Cyberspace
                    Administration of China open an investigation into the
                    security of Intel's products sold in the country "to
                    effectively safeguard China's national security and the

                    Tech-savvy or not, I’m sure this is the step when panic
                    starts creeping in. Mitrovic asked the Google support person
                    to send him an email. The voice said he would:
                  </p>

                      <p>
                        In the background, I can hear someone typing on the
                        keyboard and throughout the call there is some
                        background noise reminiscent of a call centre.

                      <p>
                        He tells me that he has sent the email. After a few
                        moments, the email arrives and at a first glance the
                        email looks legit – the sender is from a Google domain.

                    Thankfully for the IT specialist, he was careful enough to
                    start checking things. While the phone number seemed legit,
                    the email domain looked suspicious. It did not come from a
                    Google server. That’s when he realized he must have been
                    talking to an AI:

                    [...] The point of the whole thing is for the victim to
                    eventually trust the Google rep and agree to verify their
                    account. They would have probably clicked on a link taking
                    them to a Google-like website. But it would have been a scam
                    website meant to grab the password associated with the email
                    account.

                    Over the past decade, students have become overwhelmed by
                    the reading. College kids have never read everything they're
                    assigned, of course, but this feels different. Dames's
                    students now seem bewildered by the thought of finishing
                    multiple books a semester.

                    they don't know how. Middle and high schools have stopped
                    asking them to.

                    and Crime and Punishment the next. Now his students tell him
                    up front that the reading load feels impossible. It's not
                    just the frenetic pace; they struggle to attend to small

                Students at elite collages(sic) such as Columbia can't read
                books anymore. It's not that they can't read but they can
                apparently only read short texts in short bursts of time. Their
                attention span have been ruined by smartphones, modern
                technology and a few decades of modern teaching methods that
                prioritize small texts.
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes it extra bad is that these are apparently students
                that are taking courses in literature. These should be the avid
                readers. I guess we'll see more college books with large text,
                more pictures and being "for dummies" (it used to be a joke, not
                anymore I guess).

                    PRH's changing of its copyright wording to combat AI
                    training makes it the first of the Big Five publishers to
                    take such an action against AI, at least publicly.

                Will it work? Have they just created more job for themselves

                    involved participants utilizing specialized equipment
                    including sensors and earbuds. On September 24, one
                    participant sleeping at home induced lucid dreaming, a state
                    in which you are aware that you are dreaming. It is
                    apparently a trainable skill, although I have only ever
                    personally experienced it a handful of times throughout my
                    life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the night of the 24th when the REMspace participant
                    entered this state, the connected hardware they were wearing
                    pinged a remote server that generated a random Remmyo word
                    (<a href="https://remspace.net/remmyo/">Remmyo</a> is a type
                    of dream language that is detectable using sensors). The
                    word was sent to the earbuds the person was wearing, and
                    they repeated it in their dream.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The dreamer's response – the Remmyo word – was then captured
                    and stored on the server. Eight minutes later, another
                    participant entered a lucid dream and received the stored
                    message from the first user. When she woke, she confirmed
                    the word – successfully demonstrating the first-ever "chat"
                    exchange between two dreaming participants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    REMspace said two other participants were also able to
                    communicate with its server while dreaming.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The startup's founder and CEO, Michael Raduga, said
                    communicating in dreams seemed like science fiction
                    yesterday. "Tomorrow, it will be so common we won't be able
                    to imagine our lives without this technology," the executive
                    added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Raduga said the capability opens the door to countless
                    commercial applications, but stopped short of giving any
                    specific examples. "We believe that REM sleep and related
                    phenomena, like lucid dreams, will become the next big
                    industry after AI," he noted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While no doubt fascinating, it is also a bit frightening.
                    The idea of commercializing dreams sounds ripe for misuse
                    and if we're being force-fed content even while we are
                    sleeping, when will we ever be able to truly unplug and get
                    any actual rest?

                It is a long time since we issued a Meta regarding the situation
                of the site. Much has been happening, but nowhere near as
                quickly as we had imagined or had hoped. But we are now almost
                there.

                The handover of assets is taking place. The new Board has been
                instrumental in this and, when the transfer is finally complete,
                I know that NCommander wishes to write his own Meta to you, the
                community. Details of who is in which seat will happen once the
                handover is complete because, until that point, the current site
                is the one that has existed since 2014, and it is still headed
                by NCommander.
              </p>
              <p>
                New hardware is being set up which will allow us to drastically
                reduce the running costs of the site. Two people, fliptop and
                kolie, have donated the use of servers and internet connections
                free of charge to SoylentNews. This is an extremely generous
                donation on their part and one for which the new Board is
                extremely grateful. Contracts, where requested, are being
                actioned as I write this Meta. There will still be annual costs
                for domains etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                The new hardware will have a new software structure installed on
                it, based on Docker containers. These will provide a
                significantly easier system to manage and, hopefully, will also
                take care automatically with many of the disruptive issues that
                we have seen in recent months. I do not claim that there will
                not be any initial hiccups but the site will still be running on
                Rehash and will look and behave exactly as it does today. There
                will be issues regarding updates to software for which new
                procedures will have to be produced and documented, but that is
                a task for the future and it need not delay the transfer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regarding changes to software, there is an incident that took
                place last weekend. A community member informed us that the
                moderation system, under certain usages, could compromise the
                identity of both the moderator and the moderatee. I passed the
                information to NCommander and kolie who, despite it being a
                weekend, identified and confirmed the problem, and subsequently
                identified a potential fix. The software change was made by
                kolie first thing on (his) Monday morning, which means that a
                serious problem was identified and the fix implemented in a
                fraction over 24 hours. I don't think anyone could have done it
                any faster bearing in mind that this is an all-volunteer site
                and considering that it occurred at a time when most people
                would rather be having some private time with their families.
                The team we have at the moment is much smaller than we have ever
                had before but it is still capable of managing the site and
                keeping the stories flowing. It is only right that I acknowledge
                on your behalf the contribution made by, and offer my thanks to,
                the community member who reported the issue (who may identify
                themself if they wish), NCommander and in particular kolie, who
                is very much involved in the new site just as he has been for
                the last 18 months or so.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, not all problems are under our control. The current
                issues with IRC have resulted in a ticket being raised by
                NCommander for support action to be taken by Akamai/Linode. The
                problem occurred immediately after some routine maintenance, and
                it appears to be related to DNS and IPv6 as a result of changes
                that have been introduced by that maintenance. I do not have all
                the details to hand but it is being actioned.
              </p>
              <p>
                For this site to remain active and interesting we rely on
                community support. Whether that be by making submissions (you
                should know the sort of topics that we are looking for, and we
                can always put some things under the 'random' topic), or by
                offering to assist with one of the teams, or just by commenting
                as many of you are doing now. I realise that this is an
                important time in the run-up to an election but please discuss
                TFA and not bring politics into every discussion. You can
                discuss politics as much as you wish in your journals. In fact,
                there is no 'politics' topic, nor has there ever been one.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have been asked numerous times when will ACs be allowed back
                onto the front pages? There is only one person stopping that
                from happening now, and it is not me. There will always be
                occasional spamming and that can be managed quite effectively by
                community moderation. When the excessive spamming and abuse
                stops for good then ACs can return to full discussions. But
                spamming will not result in closing down this site.

                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment"
                  >Stanford Prison Experiment</a
                >" that was intended to examine the psychological experiences of
                imprisonment, has died. In the 1971 prison study funded by the
                US Office of Naval Research, Zimbardo and a team of graduate
                students recruited male college students to spend two weeks in a
                mock prison in the basement of a building on the Stanford
                campus. The United States Navy and the United States Marine
                Corps wanted to understand anti-social behavior and investigate
                conflict between military guards and prisoners. After
                psychologist

                  >Christina Maslach</a
                >
                (later to become his wife) visited to evaluate the conditions,
                she was troubled to see how study participants were behaving and
                she confronted Zimbardo. He ended the experiment on the sixth
                day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Selected student participants were assigned randomly to be
                "prisoners" or "guards" in a mock prison located in the basement
                of the psychology building at Stanford. Prisoners were confined
                to a 6 by 9 feet cell with black steel-barred doors. The only
                furniture in each cell was a cot. Solitary confinement was a
                small unlit closet. In his book Humankind - a hopeful history
                (2020) historian
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutger_Bregman/"
                  >Rutger Bregman</a
                >
                discusses charges that the whole experiment was faked and
                fraudulent; Bregman argued this experiment is often used as an
                example to show that people succumb easily to evil behavior, but
                Zimbardo was less than candid about the fact that he told the
                guards to act the way they did.
              </p>
              <p>
                Zimbardo's primary reason for conducting the experiment was to
                focus on the power of roles, rules, symbols, group identity and
                situational validation of behavior that generally would repulse
                ordinary individuals. "I had been conducting research for some
                years on deindividuation, vandalism and dehumanization that
                illustrated the ease with which ordinary people could be led to
                engage in anti-social acts by putting them in situations where
                they felt anonymous, or they could perceive of others in ways
                that made them less than human, as enemies or objects," said
                Zimbardo.

                    The Commission will determine its next steps following an
                    assessment of Temu’s response, which could result in a
                    formal investigation into the company. Under the DSA, the EU
                    can impose fines for incorrect, incomplete or misleading
                    information in response to an RFI. If Temu does not respond
                    by the deadline, it could also face periodic penalty

                    A newly formed group of UK electronics companies is
                    advocating for the removal of VAT (value-added tax) on
                    electronic spare parts, repairs, and labor in the
                    government's upcoming autumn budget, claiming this would
                    encourage consumers to get kit repaired instead of replacing
                    it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The group, which calls itself CLEAR (Circular Leadership for
                    Electronics and Recycling), says it aims to address the
                    growing issue of electronic waste and the barriers
                    preventing consumers from repairing rather than replacing
                    electrical items.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Members of the group include consumer brands such as
                    ProCook, Positec Power Tools Europe, Glen Dimplex Home
                    Appliances, and Melitta, while the group is chaired by James
                    Rigg, chief exec of
                    <a href="https://trojanelectronics.co.uk/"
                      >Trojan Electronics</a
                    >, which provides repair, refurbishment, and resell services
                    as well as contract manufacturing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Rigg, getting rid of VAT charges on electronic
                    repairs is a "crucial step" in creating a more circular
                    economy. However, CLEAR is going further and also lobbying
                    for the British government to follow the example of
                    countries like Austria and France, which have introduced
                    subsidies for electrical repairs.

                    [...] With its killer robots and its rogue AI system,
                    Skynet, The Terminator has become synonymous with the
                    spectre of a machine intelligence that turns against its
                    human creators. Picture editors routinely illustrate
                    articles about AI with the chrome death's head of the film's
                    T-800 "hunter-killer" robot. The roboticist Ronald Arkin
                    used clips from the film in a cautionary 2013 talk called
                    How NOT to build a Terminator.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The layperson is likely to imagine unaligned AI as
                    rebellious and malevolent. But the likes of Nick Bostrom
                    insist that the real danger is from careless programming.
                    Think of the sorcerer's broom in Disney's Fantasia: a device
                    that obediently follows its instructions to ruinous
                    extremes. The second type of AI is not human enough it lacks
                    common sense and moral judgement. The first is too human -
                    selfish, resentful, power-hungry. Both could in theory be
                    genocidal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Terminator therefore both helps and hinders our
                    understanding of AI: what it means for a machine to "think",
                    and how it could go horrifically wrong. Many AI researchers
                    resent the Terminator obsession altogether for exaggerating
                    the existential risk of AI at the expense of more immediate
                    dangers such as mass unemployment, disinformation and
                    autonomous weapons. "First, it makes us worry about things
                    that we probably don't need to fret about," writes Michael
                    Woolridge. "But secondly, it draws attention away from those
                    issues raised by AI that we should be concerned about."

                    is a sustainable source of food that will help us feed the
                    growing global human population while protecting wild fish
                    populations – but this isn’t true.

                    “Fish farming is not a substitute for catching wild fish out
                    of the ocean,” says
                    <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/matthew-hayek.html"
                      >Matthew Hayek</a
                    >
                    at New York University. “In fact, it relies on catching wild
                    fish out of the ocean.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hayek and his colleagues have shown that the amount of wild
                    <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article-topic/fish/"
                      >fish</a

                    killed in order to feed farmed fish is between 27 and 307
                    per cent higher than previous estimates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Farmed carnivorous fish eat multiple times more weight in
                    wild fish caught from the

                    than is obtained by farming them, says Hayek. For instance,
                    producing a kilogram of salmon may require 4 or 5 kilograms
                    of wild fish.
