                    originally to be single-user, and they weren't set up to be
                    multi-user," Green told Ars. "The fact that VAX and VMS in
                    general were designed for [multiple users] from the scratch
                    is what facilitated the multi-user aspect."

                    The VAX served DEC well throughout the '80s and into the
                    '90s, but as the latter decade went on, DEC began to face
                    stiff competition from UNIX vendors, particularly Sun
                    Microsystems. DEC struggled to change with the times, and
                    the company ultimately failed. In 1998, DEC was acquired by
                    Compaq, and in 2001, Compaq was acquired by Hewlett-Packard.
                    The DEC line, including the VAX/VMS system, was discontinued
                    and faded from the market.

                    Evidence from Gough's Cave already suggests that the eating
                    of the bodies there was of a more ritualistic form. This is
                    because there is ample evidence that the people responsible
                    were hunting and eating lots of other animals, such as deer
                    and horses, while the careful preparation of some of the
                    human remains like the skull cup and an engraved bone show
                    that some was thought was being put into the cannibalism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The fact that we find cannibalism being practiced
                    often on multiple occasions in over a short period of time,
                    in a fairly localized area and solely by individuals
                    attributed to the Magdalenian culture, means we believe this
                    behavior was one that was performed widely by the
                    Magdalenian, and was therefore a funerary behavior in
                    itself," says William.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this context, the eating of the dead can be seen as
                    different in practice, but perhaps not meaning, to
                    cremations, burials or mummification.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Building on this, William and Silvia were then able to look
                    at whether any genetic analysis had been done on the human
                    remains from these sites. This would enable the researchers
                    to see if there were any links between who was practicing
                    which funerary behaviors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Remarkably, the genetic evidence seems to suggest that the
                    two groups practicing different funerary behaviors were
                    genetically distinct populations. All the sites from which
                    evidence of cannibalism has been found show that the people
                    were part of a genetic group known as "GoyetQ2," while all
                    of the more ordinary burials were of people who belonged to
                    the "Villabruna" genetic group.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While both groups were living in Europe at the same time,
                    individuals showing GoyetQ2 ancestry are associated with the
                    region spanning the French-Spanish border, while Villabruna
                    ancestry was carried by individuals who inhabited the
                    Italian-Balkan region. This implies that when the practice
                    of eating the dead ended and more conventional burials
                    became common place in north-western Europe, it wasn't
                    through a spreading of ideas but rather Epigravettian people
                    replacing the Magdalenian.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "At this time, during the terminal period of the
                    Paleolithic, you actually see a turnover in both genetic
                    ancestry and funerary behavior," explains William. "The
                    Magdalenian associated ancestry and funerary behavior is
                    replaced by Epigravettian associated ancestry and funerary
                    behavior, indicative of population replacement as
                    Epigravettian groups migrated into north-western Europe."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Questions still remain about the funerary practices of
                    these ancient humans. For example, William and his
                    colleagues are now trying to can figure out whether these
                    cannibalized humans were related to one another, or whether
                    they were eating people from outside their immediate groups.

                    Humans and primates have brain regions in the temporal lobe
                    that are specialised in perceiving faces and bodies. Dogs
                    also possess a temporal lobe that evolved independently of
                    the primate brain. In recent years, behavioural research has
                    shown that dogs, like humans, are experts in perceiving
                    facial expressions and bodily gestures such as hand signals.
                    "Whether this behavioural expertise is also reflected in the
                    dog brain was the content of our study. Only a few research
                    groups can conduct comparative magnetic resonance imaging
                    studies with dogs," explains first author Magdalena Boch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The study with 40 human participants and 15 pet dogs
                    now provided the first evidence that dogs, like humans, have
                    a brain region in the temporal lobe that is specialised in
                    the visual perception of body postures. In addition, further
                    regions in the dog brain are equally involved in perceiving
                    faces and bodies. In contrast to humans, however, this did
                    not only affect visual brain regions. When dogs look at
                    faces and bodies, there are also differences in activation
                    in areas responsible for processing smells.

                  <p>
                    In humans, the authors additionally identified already known
                    regions specialised exclusively in face perception. "We
                    humans often focus on the face when communicating with
                    others. Our results suggest that faces are also an important
                    source of information for dogs. However, body postures and
                    holistic perception seem to play a superior role," Magdalena
                    Boch explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The specialised brain regions were equally active in dogs
                    when they looked at pictures of conspecifics or humans. This
                    underlines the close bond between dogs and humans, says
                    Ludwig Huber. "Dogs and humans may not be closely related,
                    but they have been close companions for thousands of years.
                    Therefore, comparing dogs and humans also gives us new
                    insights into the so-called convergent evolution of social
                    perception and information processing processes," Claus Lamm
                    concludes.

                  <p>
                    People can be prone to believe in conspiracy theories due to
                    a combination of personality traits and motivations,
                    including relying strongly on their intuition, feeling a
                    sense of antagonism and superiority toward others, and
                    perceiving threats in their environment, according to
                    research published by the American Psychological
                    Association.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Conspiracy theorists are not all likely to be
                    simple-minded, mentally unwell folks—a portrait which is
                    routinely painted in popular culture," said Bowes. "Instead,
                    many turn to conspiracy theories to fulfill deprived
                    motivational needs and make sense of distress and
                    impairment."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers found that overall, people were
                    motivated to believe in conspiracy theories by a need to
                    understand and feel safe in their environment and a need to
                    feel like the community they identify with is superior to
                    others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even though many conspiracy theories seem to provide clarity
                    or a supposed secret truth about confusing events, a need
                    for closure or a sense of control were not the strongest
                    motivators to endorse conspiracy theories. Instead, the
                    researchers found some evidence that people were more likely
                    to believe specific conspiracy theories when they were
                    motivated by social relationships. For instance,
                    participants who perceived social threats were more likely
                    to believe in events-based conspiracy theories, such as the
                    theory that the U.S. government planned the Sept. 11
                    terrorist attacks, rather than an abstract theory that, in
                    general, governments plan to harm their citizens to retain
                    power.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers also found that people with certain
                    personality traits, such as a sense of antagonism toward
                    others and high levels of paranoia, were more prone to
                    believe conspiracy theories. Those who strongly believed in
                    conspiracy theories were also more likely to be insecure,
                    paranoid, emotionally volatile, impulsive, suspicious,
                    withdrawn, manipulative, egocentric and eccentric.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Big Five personality traits (extraversion,
                    agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism)
                    had a much weaker relationship with conspiratorial thinking,
                    though the researchers said that does not mean that general
                    personality traits are irrelevant to a tendency to believe
                    in conspiracy theories.

                    How big is the Universe? Humanity made it all the way into

                      ><strong>no idea</strong></a

                    <em>was</em> the entire Universe. Yes, big, but not crazy
                    big. Others thought that maybe those spirals and smudges we
                    could see were in fact other galaxies altogether, which
                    would mean the Universe is unfathomably large.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the night of October 5-6, 1923 — 100 years ago tonight —
                    Edwin Hubble made an observation that would settle the
                    question once and for all. He took a 45-minute exposure of
                    Andromeda, one of the largest and thus apparently nearest
                    "spiral nebulae", and within it he spotted a single
                    compelling star that we now call Hubble V1. We here on Earth
                    will forever have a very special relationship with that
                    star, because Hubble used its characteristics to show
                    conclusively that Andromeda was not a "spiral nebula" within
                    the Milky Way at all, but rather an entirely separate galaxy
                    which he later estimated to be about 1 million (now
                    understood to be closer to 2.5 million) light-years away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Hubble's time, many other "spiral nebulae"
                    <a href="https://www.astronomy.com/observing/an-ngc-primer/"
                      ><strong>were known</strong></a
                    >
                    that appeared much smaller than Andromeda and were therefore
                    presumably quite a bit farther away. Because of his
                    observation a hundred years ago tonight, Hubble realized
                    that even Andromeda, close enough to be seen with the naked
                    eye, is on the order of 10 quintillion
                    (10,000,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from Earth. And that
                    must mean that the Universe is absurdly, almost comically,
                    huge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Imagine what Edwin Hubble felt like sitting there at Mt.
                    Wilson Observatory, probably by himself late one evening,
                    when he became the first person ever to know that for sure.
                    His use of red ink and an exclamation point in the main
                    figure of this diary illustrates that he knew darn well the
                    significance of what he had found the minute he realized
                    what it was.

                    feline. But the precise mechanisms by which kitties produce
                    those pleasant, low-frequency rumblings has been a matter of
                    some debate among scientists. Now a team of Austrian

                    Purring is mostly exclusive to cats, although certain other
                    species can produce purr-like sounds, including raccoons,
                    mongooses, kangaroos, badgers, rabbits, and guinea pigs. And

                    into those that purr (Felinae) and those that roar
                    (Pantherinae); no cat species can do both. The latter
                    category includes lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards, and

                    that the roaring capability is due to an incompletely

                    have a completely ossified hyoid, although the purring snow
                    leopard is a rare exception.

                    Resin printer company Peopoly created quite a buzz with the
                    unveiling of a
                    <a href="https://peopoly.net/products/magneto-x"
                      >prototype beltless FDM 3D printer, the Magneto X,</a
                    >
                    at the East Coast RepRap Festival. The new printer is a desk
                    top machine with a huge 400 x 300 x 300 mm build volume and
                    print speeds up to 800mm/s. It borrows a design feature seen
                    on CNC machines: magnetic linear motors. Normally, 3D
                    printers move their components with rotating stepper motors
                    attached to gears and pulleys. The linear motor can be
                    thought of as a flat, unrolled motor with the "rotor"
                    attached to the moving component – the tool head – and the
                    stator forming a track along one axis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dubbed the "MagXY" system, the tool head seems to levitate
                    across the gantry without obvious means. It has a top print
                    speed of 800 mm/s with a max acceleration of 22,000 mm/s²,
                    which would make it faster than modern

                    [...] Peopoly is known for high end, large scale, liquid
                    resin 3D printers and the Magneto X will be it's first
                    plastic pushing printer. The printer will likewise be a
                    premium machine with a price tag starting at $1999,
                    currently on sale for $1399 during the pre-order phase. The
                    optional enclosure will cost $79 more. Printers are expected
                    to begin shipping in late November.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Peopoly is leaning hard into the Open Source
                    community. Not only have they become backers of Klipper
                    firmware, they are also using – and supporting – Open Source
                    OcraSlicer. The Magneto X's nozzles are compatible with the
                    popular E3D's V6 volcano which suggests the machine will be
                    open to modification by users. Peopoly also states its
                    machine can be used without joining a cloud-based system and
                    promises customer data will not be collected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 3D printer will have a load cell sensor for precise auto
                    leveling and four independent Z-axis stepper motors for
                    dynamic adjustments. The hotend is rated to 300 degrees
                    Celsius, and with an available enclosure will be able to
                    print engineering grade materials. Prints will be monitored
                    with an included camera which can also take time lapses.

                    Science is a collaborative effort. What we know today would
                    have never been, had it not been generations of scientists
                    reusing and building on the work of their predecessors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, in modern times, academia has become increasingly
                    competitive and indeed rather hostile to the individual
                    researchers. This is especially true for early-career
                    researchers yet to secure tenure and build a name in their
                    fields. Nowadays, scholars are left to compete with each
                    other for citations of their published work, awards and
                    funding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, understandably, many scientists have grown unwilling to
                    cooperate and help their peers by sharing their work. They
                    would "hide" their raw data, despite having taken years-long
                    efforts to collect it. They would also conceal experiments
                    that have failed or proved insignificant. All these
                    practices would then result in different teams wasting
                    precious time in running the same useless studies, rather
                    than making further progress and contributing to the world's
                    knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to their findings, a specific personality
                    trait called "victim sensitivity" predicted knowledge hiding
                    in science. Researchers with this personality trait are
                    characterized by a latent fear of being exploited by others,
                    and thus, are more suspicious about their colleagues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The good news, point out the authors of the study, is
                    that—among the participants—the intention to hide knowledge
                    was rather low.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the authors warn about a potential bias. It is
                    likely that researchers who volunteered to take part in
                    these studies were more cooperative to begin with.
                    Additionally, it might be that in the context of
                    self-reporting, the participants tried to present themselves
                    as more likable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We may need to change the stereotypical way we think about
                    ourselves as researchers, in order to build trust and create
                    a sharing environment among scientists," concludes the
                    research team. "Identifying as a researcher should include
                    being cooperative, other-oriented, and trustworthy: a social
                    identity that stands for knowledge sharing—not knowledge
                    hiding."

                    specifically linked to Bing AI's text-to-image generator
                    (which is powered by DALL-E 3) as a "quick method." After
                    finding the right tool—which could also be a more old-school
                    photo-editing tool like Photoshop—users are instructed to
                    add incendiary captions and share the images on social media
                    to create a blitz of racist images online.<br />[...]<br />Perhaps
                    because Bing AI's tool has seemingly been deemed the
                    quickest method, it has potentially become the most popular
                    tool in the thread. 404 Media concluded that—"judging by the
                    images' default square format, the uniform 1024 x 1024
                    resolution"—"most of the images in the thread appear to be
                    generated with Bing," then spread on social media platforms,
                    including Telegram, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

                  <p>
                    Samsung's head of US Foundry business echoed those
                    sentiments: "Samsung's advanced silicon manufacturing nodes
                    will accelerate Tenstorrent's innovations in RISC-V and AI

                    Tenstorrent hopes to become an alternative to Nvidia for AI
                    hardware. It builds some of its products – such as its 2023
                    standalone ML computer, Black Hole – on RISC-V CPU cores.
                    Sixteen of them, to be exact.

                    it was an official member of the RISC-V Software Ecosystem,
                    which develops code to run on open processor architecture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The current deal for next-gen products, however, has the
                    Korean megalith manufacturing Tenstorrent's Quasar chiplet
                    using Samsung's SF4X process and 4nm architecture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We leave the decision to them where the chips get
                    made," said [Tenstorrent vice president of strategy and
                    corporate communications Bob] Grim. The veep noted that his
                    current customers – LG Electronics and Hyundai – are both in

                    Samsung is a licensee of Arm processor designs – a rival to
                    RISC-V. Working with Tenstorrent gives Samsung potential
                    exposure to the open processor design that could help it to
                    win more fabrication work from other RISC-V players.

                    terror" and hundreds of bugs being uncovered throughout the
                    codebase. In 2023 new X.Org security vulnerabilities
                    continue to be uncovered, two of which were made public
                    today and date back to X11R2 code from the year 1988.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Made public today was CVE-2023-43785 as an out-of-bounds
                    memory access within the libX11 code that has been around
                    since 1996. A second libX11 flaw is stack exhaustion from
                    infinite recursion within the PutSubImage() function of
                    libX11... This vulnerability has been around since X11R2 in
                    February of 1988.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A third libX11 vulnerability made public today is an integer
                    overflow within XCreateImage() that leads to a heap
                    overflow... That too has been around since X11R2 in 1988.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Two libXpm vulnerabilities were also disclosed today related
                    to out-of-bounds reads and both of those date back to 1998.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due to these issues coming to light, libX11 1.8.7 and libXpm
                    3.5.17 were released today with the necessary security
                    fixes. More details on these latest X.Org security

                    To lead the spin off, Intel tapped 23-year veteran Rivera as

                    following Gelsinger's return to the fab giant in 2021.
                    Rivera is due to make the transition to the standalone PSG
                    biz in January, and will continue to head up Intel's

                    [...] While Intel is still working to fill out PSG's
                    executive suite, Rivera will be joined by Shannon Poulin as
                    chief operating officer. Poulin previously served as VP of

                    within the next two to three years. But much like Softbank's

                    Humans are increasingly settling in areas highly exposed to
                    dangerous flooding, a study warned Wednesday, with China
                    helping drive the rise in risky urban expansion into exposed
                    areas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research, led by a World Bank economist, warns that
                    settlement growth in flood zones has vastly outpaced growth
                    in safe areas since 1985.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In a time when human settlements should be adapting to
                    climate change, many countries are actually rapidly
                    increasing their exposure to floods," author Jun Rentschler
                    told AFP.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study analyzed 30 years of satellite imagery tracking
                    the expansion of human settlement globally, along with flood
                    maps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] East Asia and the Pacific region are among the most
                    exposed, driven particularly by urban expansion in China, as
                    well as Vietnam and Bangladesh.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In Vietnam, where almost one-third of the coastline is now
                    built up, the safest and most productive locations are
                    increasingly occupied," the authors wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Thus, new developments are disproportionately forced onto
                    hazardous land and previously avoided areas, such as
                    riverbeds or floodplains."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The analysis does not incorporate potential increases in
                    flood risks caused by climate change, deforestation or
                    changes to features such as riverbeds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Rentschler said there was little evidence flood zones
                    were expanding at a rate similar to human settlement in
                    known risk areas, suggesting settlement patterns remain the
                    key factor for policymakers to address.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Rentschler argues understanding the settlement trend
                    should be the first step in shifting urbanization policies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is where you want to start: before reducing risks,
                    countries need to stop increasing it," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Local authorities can actually do much more to protect
                    people and prevent future climate change impacts."

                    [...] This collection and sharing of biometric information
                    is what enables the passport-free immigration process –
                    passenger and crew information will need to be disclosed to
                    the airport operator to use for bag management, access
                    control, gate boarding, duty-free purchases, as well as
                    tracing individuals within the airport for security

                    The shared biometrics will serve as a "single token of

                    Members of Singapore's parliament have raised concerns about
                    shifting to universal automated clearance, including data
                    privacy, and managing technical glitches.

                    According to Teo, only Singaporean companies will be allowed
                    ICA-related IT contracts, vendors will be given
                    non-disclosure agreements, and employees of such firms must
                    undergo security screening. Traveler data will be encrypted
                    and transported through data exchange gateways.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for who will protect the data, that role goes to CAG,
                    with ICA auditing its compliance.

                    In case of disruptions that can't be handled by an

                    And even though the ministry is pushing universal coverage,
                    there will be some exceptions, such as those who are unable
                    to provide certain biometrics or are less digitally

                    free - and illegal, but it didn't stop a Detroit man from

                    Set your watches! Scientists have set the clock ticking for
                    the development of a new generation of timepieces with
                    accuracy of up to 1 second in 300 billion years or about 22
                    times the age of the universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers working at European XFEL X-ray have examined the
                    potential of scandium as the basis for nuclear clocks, long
                    seen as the next step forward in accuracy over the current
                    generation of atomic clocks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most atomic clocks rely on oscillators such as caesium,
                    which can oscillate at very reliable frequencies when
                    excited by microwave radiation. For example, the US
                    Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and
                    Technology's NIST-F2 clock would neither gain nor lose one
                    second in about 300 million years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But scientists have held the ambition of going one step
                    further by using the oscillation of the atomic nucleus –
                    rather than the electron shell – to create the next level in
                    timekeeping.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ralf Röhlsberger, researcher at Germany's Deutsches
                    Elektronen-Synchrotron, was part of the team. He said the
                    level of accuracy possible from a nuclear clock using
                    scandium could be equivalent to one second in 300 billion
                    years, according

                    In other words, if your watch loses a second a year, it will
                    be 9,512 years slow by the time a nuclear clock based on
                    scandium is a second out.

                    With every new infection, the pandemic coronavirus gets new
                    chances to mutate and adapt, creating opportunities for the
                    virus to evolve new variants that are better at dodging our
                    immune systems and making us sicker.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Anti-viral drugs, such as Paxlovid and remdesivir, aim to
                    halt this incessant evolution in individual
                    patients—shortening illnesses, snuffing out opportunities
                    for mutation, and reducing transmission. But one antiviral
                    appears to be backfiring—allowing SARS-CoV-2 more
                    opportunities to mutate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06649-6"
                      >a new peer-reviewed study in the journal Nature</a
                    >, the anti-viral drug dubbed molnupiravir is linked to
                    specific SARS-CoV-2 mutation signatures that happened to
                    spring up in 2022 when the drug was introduced.<br />[...]<br />Beyond
                    simply finding molnupiravir-linked mutations, the
                    researchers noted concerning features of them. The
                    researchers found evidence that some of the
                    molnupiravir-linked mutations were under positive
                    selection—that is, they increased in frequency, suggesting
                    that they were advantageous to the virus in some way. They
                    also noted that some viruses with molnupiravir-linked
                    mutations were passed on from person to person in clusters,
                    which suggested onward transmission of these drug-induced
                    mutations.<br />[...]<br />When
                    <a
                      href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-additional-oral-antiviral-treatment-covid-19-certain"
                      >molnupiravir was authorized in the US</a
                    >, there was concern about its potential to cause mutations
                    in people's DNA, rather than the virus. For this reason, it
                    is
                    <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/155055/download"
                      >not recommended for use in pregnant people</a
                    >. But the new data gives birth to more concern about
                    mutations. And this risk is coupled with lackluster efficacy
                    data. In a final data analysis for the Food and Drug
                    Administration, molnupiravir's maker, Merck, combined two
                    sets of trial data to come up with an estimate of just 30
                    percent efficacy at preventing hospitalization and death.<br />[...]<br />FDA
                    advisers summarized the data at the time as "not
                    overwhelmingly good" and "modest at best." They voted in
                    favor of authorizing the drug in a narrow 13 to 10 vote. The
                    drug has never gained a foothold in Europe. Earlier this
                    year, the European Medicines Agency
                    <a
                      href="https://www.merck.com/news/merck-and-ridgeback-provide-update-on-eu-marketing-authorization-application-for-lagevrio-molnupiravir/"

                      molnupiravir</a
                    >. Upon the EMA's rejection, Merck said it was confident of
                    the drug's role in fighting COVID-19 and that it would
                    appeal the decision. In addition to the US, molnupiravir is
                    approved for use in over two dozen countries, including
                    Australia, China, Japan, and the UK, though use of the drug
                    has been scaled back in many places.

                The problem with capturing energy from exhaust heat is that the

                has also sought to cut costs for teams, meaning that adding a
                component like an MGU-H to capture energy while on throttle
                seems unlikely.

                At least in the short term, racing series that have long races
                are likely to use hybrid engines instead of going fully
                electric. If nothing else, this will attract more OEMs to the
                sport. NASCAR currently has only three OEMs, which are Ford,
                Chevrolet, and Toyota. Despite frequent rumors of Dodge
                returning, this has yet to occur, and NASCAR has also failed to
                attract other new OEMs. It is also likely that hybrid engines
                would allow for increased overall power despite the internal
                combustion engine currently being limited to 670 horsepower, and
                more power may well improve the quality of racing on some
                tracks. Switching to hybrid engines is likely to benefit both
                NASCAR teams and fans, and would be a step closer to once again
                racing true stock cars. However, it's much less obvious how to
                go about capturing energy on oval tracks where there is little
                braking, meaning that hybrid engines might not make a meaningful
                impact at a large percentage of NASCAR tracks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Given the cost and technical limitations, how can NASCAR
                actually make hybrid engines work and have a meaningful impact
                on most of their tracks? It might not be practical to boost
                power through hybrid engines on NASCAR's fastest superspeedways,
                where engine power is greatly restricted to keep speeds down and
                improve safety. But how can NASCAR make hybrid engines work for

                    Reddit said Wednesday that the platform is revamping its
                    privacy settings with an aim to make ad personalization and
                    account visibility toggles consistent. Most notably though,
                    it is removing the ability to opt out of ad personalization
                    based on Reddit activity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company said that it will still have opt-out controls in
                    "select countries" without specifying which ones. It
                    mentioned in a blog post that users won't see more ads but
                    they will see better-targeted ads following this change.

                    "Reddit requires very little personal information, and we
                    like it that way. Our advertisers instead rely on
                    on-platform activity—what communities you join, leave,
                    upvotes, downvotes, and other signals—to get an idea of what
                    you might be interested in," Reddit

                    [...] The company noted that ad-limiting controls will
                    possibly show you fewer ads from mentioned categories if the
                    toggles are turned off, but won't possibly filter out all
                    ads. Reddit justified this by saying it uses manual tagging
                    and machine learning to label ads, so there is a chance that
                    it is not 100% accurate.

                    is allowed to continue, a situation, he said, that starts
                    with searches on desktop and mobile but extends to the
                    emerging battleground of artificial intelligence.

                    against Google, now into its 14th day. He is the most senior
                    tech executive yet to testify during the trial that focuses
                    on the power of Google as the default search engine on
                    mobile devices and browsers around the globe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] even more worrisome, Nadella argued, is that the
                    enormous amount of search data that is provided to Google
                    through its default agreements can help Google train its AI
                    models to be better than anyone else's — threatening to give
                    Google an unassailable advantage in generative AI that would
                    further entrench its power.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In addition to training its models on search queries,
                    Google has also been moving to secure agreements with
                    content publishers to ensure that it has exclusive access to
                    their material for AI training purposes, according the
                    Microsoft CEO. In Nadella's own meetings with publishers, he
                    said that he now hears that Google "wants ... to write this
                    check and we want you to match it." (Google didn't
                    immediately respond to questions about those deals.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The requests highlight concerns that "what is publicly
                    available today [may not be] publicly available tomorrow"
                    for AI training, according to the testimony.

                    Another problem is the semantic difference that occurs when
                    developers install open source outside of distros and
                    package databases. Modern security scanners all rely on this
                    metadata, so security vulnerabilities go undetected for open
                    source that is installed outside of the distro or package
                    database.

                    [...] We’ve seen great progress the past few years in better
                    establishing the security of open source projects. From the
                    previously mentioned SSDF framework, to Sigstore and SLSA,
                    multiple complementary projects have created developer
                    toolchains for establishing where open source comes from,
                    whether it has been tampered with, and other more reliable
                    trust signals. This range of concerns is frequently referred
                    to as “provenance,” and these open source projects have been
                    aggressively baked into the major programming language
                    registries such as npm, Maven and PyPi, as well as
                    Kubernetes itself supporting software signing with Sigstore.

                    components and introduces a novel rolling-release cadence so

                    real vulnerability and don’t miss out on false negatives.
                    With less code, fewer bugs, and fewer vulnerabilities, this
                    slim-down of the distro also lets Wolfi give its users more
                    severity-level data CVSS scores, plus support for new
                    versions of open source software packages. On its one-year
                    anniversary, Wolfi supports 1,300 package configurations and
                    has gained the support of scanners from the major container
                    security players such as Docker Scout, Grype, Snyk, Trivy,
                    Wiz, and Prisma Cloud.

                    “Open source used to mean that you get a free copy of that
                    source code forever,” says Lorenc. “Software doesn’t work
                    like that anymore. You need a plan to constantly update
                    every piece of software because of the rate of
                    vulnerabilities being found. Software expires, and this is
                    no longer a static problem, it’s dynamic.”

                    Today we're announcing Google-Extended, a new control that
                    web publishers can use to manage whether their sites help
                    improve Bard and Vertex AI generative APIs, including future
                    generations of models that power those products. By using
                    Google-Extended to control access to content on a site, a
                    website administrator can choose whether to help these AI
                    models become more accurate and capable over time.

                Just like you could previously modify your robots.txt file to
                not be included in Googles webcrawling you are now supposed to
                be able to opt out of being used as language model fodder for
                their AI. So adding those two lines should apparently do the
                trick. No word on if other models will adhere to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                No word on if they will remove content already gathered, don't
                bet on it, or how this will be punished in the future. The
                current claim is that it will not effect ranking in the search
                engine. But that could always change.
              </p>
              <p>
                I like how they phrase it as you "help these AI models" and by
                then opting out of that you are not being helpful or nice. You
                help and they reap all the rewards of your work, that sounds
                like a good deal .. right!?

                    In a time of income inequality and ruthless politics, people
                    with outsized power or an unrelenting willingness to
                    browbeat others often seem to come out ahead.

                  <p>
                    New research from Dartmouth, however, shows that being
                    uncooperative can help people on the weaker side of a power
                    dynamic achieve a more equal outcome—and even inflict some
                    loss on their abusive counterpart.

                    theory as "zero-determinant strategies" developed by
                    renowned scientists William Press, now at the University of
                    Texas at Austin, and the late Freeman Dyson at the Institute
                    for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.

                  <p>
                    Zero-determinant strategies dictate that "extortionists"
                    control situations to their advantage by becoming less and
                    less cooperative—though just cooperative enough to keep the
                    other party engaged—and by never being the first to concede
                    when there's a stalemate. Theoretically, they will always
                    outperform their opponent by demanding and receiving a
                    larger share of what's at stake.

                    [...] "Unbending players who choose not to be extorted can
                    resist by refusing to fully cooperate. They also give up
                    part of their own payoff, but the extortioner loses even
                    more," says Chen, who is now an assistant professor at the
                    Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our work shows that when an extortioner is faced with an
                    unbending player, their best response is to offer a fair
                    split, thereby guaranteeing an equal payoff for both
                    parties," she says. "In other words, fairness and
                    cooperation can be cultivated and enforced by unbending
                    players."

                  <p>
                    [...] "The empirical evidence to date suggests that people
                    do engage in these extortionate behaviors, especially in
                    asymmetric situations, and that the extorted party often
                    tries to resist it, which is then costly to both parties,"

                  <p>
                    [...] Well before Quesst, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works—its
                    legendary advanced aerospace design group—had already been
                    working on what would eventually become the X-59. Back in
                    2013, the plane was known as C100, and it looked a little
                    bit like a shorter version of the Concorde with the engine
                    right on its back, splitting a V-shaped tail.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Through all of these iterations, Richardson and his
                    team learned a few important lessons about designing for
                    supersonic boom. First, the heavy, bulky parts of the plane
                    needed to be as far back as possible. "We really put nothing
                    out in the front, but we want to have that long, fine
                    ratio," he says. This resulted in an extremely fine nose and
                    body, with no surface interruptions that can produce noise
                    when the plane breaks the sound barrier. "You want to be
                    able to stretch out and manage the different shocks across
                    the length of the airplane," he adds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They also learned that anything that causes discontinuity in
                    the airplane's shape—for instance a windshield or canopy—can
                    add to the boom effect. This led them to get rid of the
                    windshield altogether. Instead, the X-59 uses an external
                    vision system, which is the only advanced technology in the
                    plane, according to Richardson. The pilot navigates using a
                    camera, viewing the outside through a large display. This
                    system had to undergo rigorous certification by the Federal
                    Aviation Administration for use in the national airspace.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite their best efforts to create a streamlined body, the
                    team found that bulges were inevitable. Richardson describes
                    how the inlet for the engine was placed on top of the plane
                    so the shock that's generated goes up into space rather than
                    down to the ground. (This is what happened with the
                    Concorde's engines, which were under its wings.) The same
                    thing goes for any actuators, whose position on top will
                    send shocks up instead of down.

                  <p>
                    The X-59 has been designed to manage and distribute
                    shockwaves differently from the very start while also flying
                    at slower speeds than the Concorde (the Concorde's cruising
                    speed was 1,350 mph, while the X-59 will cruise at around
                    925 mph). "I think most people look at the airplane and they
                    say, 'Wait, something's wrong,'" Richardson says. "[They
                    think]
                    <em
                      >it's too long. The landing gear is too far in the back.
                      And why is the nose so long?</em
                    >"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "I think the biggest challenge that anybody who would
                    go and develop one of these airliners would have is finding
                    an engine that would fly at Mach 1.8 without an afterburner
                    and be large enough for an airplane of this size,"
                    Richardson says, but noting that it is doable.

                    about whether a stuffed registry can contribute to game
                    performance issues or wider system problems, beyond a few
                    hundred MB of chewed-up space, there is one broad point of
                    agreement: It's a bad look for a game already viewed as
                    having been offered up too early, even with a prominent
                    Early Access label.

                    [...] Steam, among other platforms, continues to let
                    customers review early access games.
                    <em>Kerbal Space Program</em> is aggregated for all reviews
                    as "Overwhelmingly Positive," while KSP2 is "Mixed" for all
                    reviews, and "Mostly Negative" for 342 recent reviews, as of
                    this writing. We will see whether this kind of feedback
                    helps shape the game for its final release.

                    TechCrunch has confirmed in our own tests that an option on
                    X to directly report election misinformation no longer
                    appears for users with an IP address located in the US,
                    Australia, Brazil or Spain — which were some of the earliest
                    markets to get the ability to report political
                    misinformation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead users who click on the "report post" option in the
                    drop-down menu attached to each post (i.e. tweet) are
                    presented with options to make reports for the following
                    reasons: Hate; abuse &amp; harassment; violent speech; child
                    safety; privacy; spam; suicide or self harm; sensitive or

                    The closest option to misleading information is to make a
                    report for deceptive identities — but the option is focused
                    on account impersonation, including of brands, so looks
                    ill-suited to reporting other types of political

                    The ESA test, meanwhile, will run for approximately one
                    minute and be conducted in cooperation with television and
                    radio broadcasters as well as over cable systems, weather
                    radios, and via satellite radio. The message seen on these
                    platforms will resemble familiar monthly ESA test messages,
                    and will be be served as a common alerting protocol (CAP)
                    message via the Integrated Public Alert and Warning
                    System-Open Platform for Emergency Networks (IPAWS-OPEN).

                    The public tests can be a minor inconvenience but are a
                    necessary evil to ensure that emergency alert services are
                    operating as intended in the event of a true emergency. A
                    backup date of October 11 is also in place should widespread
                    severe weather or other significant events occur on October
                    4.

                    Nissan will accelerate plans towards electrification by
                    committing that all vehicles sold in Europe will be electric
                    by 2030.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The announcement comes despite the UK postponing its 2030
                    ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2035.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nissan's boss said the firm's move was "the right thing to
                    do".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Car trade body the SMMT has voiced concerns that the
                    postponement of the ban would see consumers delay the switch
                    to electric vehicles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nissan will also introduce new battery technology by the end
                    of the decade that it said will reduce both the charging
                    time and cost of electric vehicles (EVs).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Nissan will make the switch to full electric by 2030 in
                    Europe. We believe it is the right thing to do for our
                    business, our customers and for the planet," said Nissan's
                    chief executive Makoto Uchida.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an interview with the BBC, Mr Uchida said the company was
                    aiming to bring down the cost of electric vehicles for
                    customers, so that they were no more expensive than petrol
                    and diesel cars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It may take a bit of time, but we are looking at the next
                    few years," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are looking at it from the point of view of the
                    technology, from the point of view of cooperating with
                    suppliers, and of course working with the government on how
                    we can deliver that kind of cost competitiveness to the
                    consumer," Mr Uchida added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Will that price parity happen by 2030? "That's what we're
                    aiming for," confirmed Mr Uchida.

                    crossed the U.S. Southwest on May 20, 2012, this one will be
                    visible from a similar region, crossing eight U.S. states

                    During an annular solar eclipse, the moon appears slightly
                    smaller than the sun, so it can't block the entire disk. The
                    result is a beautiful "ring of fire." Here's everything you
                    need to know about this rare event.

                    "I do have a mission area protecting and defending, and

                    Saltzman said last week that it would be up to Dickinson's

                It seems that a couple of recent stories have suddenly
                disappeared off our screens. We are looking into the cause but I
                apologize for those who were having a discussion which has now
                been cut short.

                    The rise of virtual artificial intelligence (AI) girlfriends
                    is enabling the silent epidemic of loneliness in an entire
                    generation of young men. It is also having severe
                    consequences for America's future.

              <p>Are they really lonely if they have their AI girlfriend?</p>
              <p>
                Interesting how this becomes a man problem, and not a woman
                problem. The blame here is entirely shifted towards the male of
                the species. While women are somehow innocent victims, as per
                usual. Are there no AI boyfriends, there are. They just don't
                seem to be problematic. Which is odd.

                    COVID-19 finally burst this 40-year bubble. During pandemic
                    lockdowns, many people worked from home and became
                    comfortable with virtual meetings. Telecommuting grew as
                    conventional commuting declined. Workers with the resources

                    Now, many employers want their staffs to return to the

                    Like many U.S. cities, Portland, Oregon, is losing downtown
                    businesses. This is cutting into urban revenues and creating
                    a perception of decline.

                    There are significant knock-on effects. A range of
                    businesses, including restaurants, retail stores and
                    services, rely on downtown office workers.

                    form of the United States, with people and money flowing to
                    Main Street stores through the 1960s, then to suburban malls
                    in the 1970s and 80s, then

                    The diversity of yeast species in Japan reflects the

                    prefecture's diverse biomes—hydrosphere, forests, and arable
                    land—and highly variable climate encourage this diversity.

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Trilobites first appear early in the Cambrian and are one of
                    the earliest examples of arthropods, the group that includes
                    all insects. They flourished for over 100 million years,
                    leaving fossils that are seemingly ubiquitous—we've
                    described over 20,000 different trilobite species. That's
                    over three times the number of mammalian species we're aware
                    of.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite all those fossils, however, we've never found one
                    with a meal inside it. We've been able to infer what some of
                    them were likely to have been dining on based on their
                    appearance and the ecosystems they were found in, but we
                    haven't been able to establish what they ate with certainty.
                    But today, researchers are describing an exquisitely
                    preserved sample that includes several of the animal's last
                    meals, which suggests that this particular animal was a bit
                    like an aquatic vacuum cleaner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The one caution the researchers raise about this find
                    is that the feeding behavior of the trilobite may not be
                    entirely normal. There's a discontinuity in the animal's
                    shell between two of its segments, which can be an
                    indication that it's getting ready to molt. If that's the
                    case, the animal may have been overeating to generate
                    additional pressure to help it break out of its old shell.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, after tens of thousands of trilobite fossils, we finally
                    have one with food inside of it. Yet it seems to be from a
                    species that had a bizarre feeding pattern, and this
                    particular individual may have been sucking down more food
                    than usual. So, we'll probably need to find a few more of
                    these to get a better picture of what trilobites ate.

                    The exosuit could prove a useful tool for athletes looking
                    to speed up during training. "Although this is a preliminary
                    study, we can say the exosuit can augment the human ability
                    to run," says Giuk Lee, an associate professor at Chung-Ang
                    University in Seoul, South Korea, who led the research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lee and his team built a lightweight exosuit with steel
                    cables powered by electrical motors attached to the runner's
                    thighs. The motors pull the cables, mimicking the
                    contraction of muscles. The exosuit helps people run faster
                    by assisting their hip extension—the powerful motion that
                    propels a runner forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The exosuit tracks the wearer's lower-body movements in real
                    time through sensors on both thighs. This data feeds into an
                    algorithm designed to monitor gait, which works in tandem
                    with other algorithms to track each runner's individual
                    running style and speed.

                  <p>
                    Hackers backed by the Chinese government are planting
                    malware into routers that provides long-lasting and
                    undetectable backdoor access to the networks of
                    multinational companies in the US and Japan, governments in
                    both countries said Wednesday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The hacking group, tracked under names including BlackTech,
                    Palmerworm, Temp.Overboard, Circuit Panda, and Radio Panda,
                    has been operating since at least 2010, a joint advisory
                    published by government entities in the US and Japan
                    reported. The group has a history of targeting public
                    organizations and private companies in the US and East Asia.
                    The threat actor is somehow gaining administrator
                    credentials to network devices used by subsidiaries and
                    using that control to install malicious firmware that can be
                    triggered with "magic packets" to perform specific tasks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The hackers then use control of those devices to infiltrate
                    networks of companies that have trusted relationships with
                    the breached subsidiaries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Specifically, upon gaining an initial foothold into a
                    target network and gaining administrator access to network
                    edge devices, BlackTech cyber actors often modify the
                    firmware to hide their activity across the edge devices to
                    further maintain persistence in the network," officials
                    wrote in Wednesday's advisory. "To extend their foothold
                    across an organization, BlackTech actors target branch
                    routers—typically smaller appliances used at remote branch
                    offices to connect to a corporate headquarters—and then
                    abuse the trusted relationship of the branch routers within
                    the corporate network being targeted. BlackTech actors then
                    use the compromised public-facing branch routers as part of
                    their infrastructure for proxying traffic, blending in with
                    corporate network traffic, and pivoting to other victims on
                    the same corporate network."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To install their modified bootloader, the US and
                    Japanese advisory said, the threat actors install an older
                    version of the legitimate firmware and then modify it as it
                    runs in memory. The technique overrides signature checks in
                    the Cisco ROM monitor signature validation functions,
                    specifically functions of Cisco's IOS Image Load test and
                    the Field Upgradeable ROMMON Integrity test. The modified
                    firmware, which consists of a Cisco IOS loader that installs
                    an embedded IOS image, allows the compromised routers to
                    make connections over SSH without being recorded in event
                    logs.

                    In an utterly firm effort to undercut plant-based rivals,
                    big players in the dairy industry are again putting the
                    squeeze on lawmakers to outlaw the use of the term "milk"
                    for non-dairy beverages—or, in Food and Drug Administration
                    lingo, beverages that are not the "lacteal secretion of
                    cows."

                    resentment over the labeling.

                A lot of academic research is funded from government grants from
                agencies like NSF. For grants that have already been approved,
                universities can continue to conduct research. However, the
                shutdown will halt the review and approval of new grants. The
                same article from <i>Nature</i> reports:
              </p>
              <p>
                The US National Science Foundation (NSF), expects to halt work
                for 1,487 out of its 1,946 employees, once short-term funding
                runs out, for example. Scientists can continue to submit
                applications for funding to the agency, which pays for about
                one-quarter of the taxpayer-supported basic research in the
                United States, but no new projects will be approved. The
                Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the US
                National Institutes of Health, a significant funder of
                biomedical research, plans to furlough some 37,325 people — 42%
                of its staff — by the second day of a shutdown. 'Essential'
                staff working at its clinical centre or on public-safety
                missions such as monitoring for viral outbreaks will continue to
                report to work.

                  >article in <i>Science</i></a
                >
                states that many clinical trials supported by the National
                Institutes of Health (NIH) will be affected:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    NIH was mostly spared in the last shutdown because its
                    budget had already been approved by Congress, but this time
                    it will feel the impact. A subset of its nearly 19,800
                    employees—just 4427, or 22%—will remain on duty to care for
                    patients at the NIH Clinical Center and maintain research
                    animals and cell lines for labs in the agency's intramural
                    research program. No new patients will be enrolled in trials
                    unless their illness is life threatening. The agency also
                    expects to keep open PubMed, which holds biomedical research
                    abstracts needed for health care, and the ClinicalTrials.gov
                    registry, where reporting of clinical studies is a legal
                    requirement.

              <p>
                However, the <i>Science</i> article notes that some astronomy
                research will continue to be conducted during the shutdown due
                to leftover funds from the current fiscal year or other external
                funding:

                    As for research infrastructure that NSF supports, a small
                    number of employees deemed essential will continue to
                    provide support for research programs in the Arctic and
                    Antarctic. And many NSF-funded telescopes should be able to
                    remain open for an extended period thanks to extra funding
                    the agency provided this year to tide them over in case of a
                    shutdown. Most of the optical telescopes are managed for NSF
                    by a nongovernmental organization, the Association of
                    Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). It has
                    "sufficient financial resources to maintain our functional
                    and research activities for a reasonable length of time," an
                    AURA spokesperson told ScienceInsider.

                    university coalition, "We are doing exactly nothing special
                    to prepare for the shutdown," Director Tony Beasley says.
                    That contrasts with the government shutdown of 2013, when
                    NRAO was forced to switch off its U.S.-based facilities
                    after just a few days.

                Other agencies will continue to provide services that are deemed
                essential but will cease other operations. For example,
                <a
                  href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/home/article/shutdown-nws-forecasts-impact-18395688.php"

                  and warnings</a
                >
                but research to improve weather forecasts will be halted during
                a shutdown. As in the 2019 government shutdown,
                <a
                  href="https://www.npr.org/2019/01/18/686451007/how-the-government-shutdown-is-affecting-weather-forecasts"
                  >the forecasters who issue alerts such as tornado and
                  hurricane warnings will be expected to do so but won't be paid

                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                In summary, the looming government shutdown will not halt
                science-related activities that are deemed necessary to
                imminently protecting life and property, such as issuing weather
                warnings. However, the employees who provide those services will
                not get paid until after the government shutdown ends. For
                agencies that do not have supplemental funds available,
                scientific research will generally be halted.

                    Malicious advertisements are now being injected into
                    Microsoft's AI-powered Bing Chat responses, promoting fake
                    download sites that distribute malware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bing Chat, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 engine, was introduced
                    by Microsoft in February 2023 to challenge Google's
                    dominance in the search industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By offering users an interactive chat-based experience
                    instead of the traditional search query and result format,
                    Bing Chat aimed to make online searches more intuitive and
                    user-friendly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In March, Microsoft began injecting ads into Bing Chat
                    conversations to generate revenue from this new platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, incorporating ads into Bing Chat has opened the
                    door to threat actors, who
                    <a

                  <p>
                    Furthermore, conversing with AI-powered chat tools can
                    instill unwarranted trust, potentially convincing users to
                    click on ads, which isn't the case when skimming through
                    impersonal search results.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This conversation-like interaction can imbue AI-provided
                    URLs with a misplaced sense of authority and
                    trustworthiness, so the existing problem of malvertizing in
                    search platforms is amplified by the introduction of AI
                    assistants.

                    The fact that these ads are labeled as promoted results when
                    the user hovers over a link in Bing Chat conversations is
                    likely too weak of a measure to mitigate the risk.

                    [...] The display of malvertising within Bing Chat
                    conversations highlights the expanding frontier of cyber
                    threats and makes it crucial for users to be wary of chatbot

                    Starting on November 1st, Disney Plus will begin restricting
                    password sharing. In Canada.

                    The company announced the change in an email sent to
                    Canadian subscribers. Disney has not provided many details
                    on how it plans to enforce this policy — its email merely
                    states that "we're implementing restrictions on your ability
                    to share your account or login credentials outside of your
                    household." The announcement reads more like a strong finger
                    wag than anything else. "You may not share your subscription
                    outside of your household," reads the company's updated Help
                    Center.

                    lead to account limits or termination.

                    exploring" ways to address shared accounts. Iger said that a
                    "significant" number of people are currently sharing
                    passwords across Disney's services and added that Disney has
                    the "technical capability" to monitor sign-ins.

                    Disney Plus is just the latest streaming service to attempt
                    to tackle password sharing. Netflix has been testing such

                      >May 2023</a
                    >. Netflix accounts are restricted based on a user's IP
                    address; subscribers, depending on the plan they select,
                    have the option of adding additional members to their
                    accounts for an additional fee. The company said in its Q2
                    earnings call that its policy has driven more subscribers to
                    the service.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But hey, if it's any consolation: Canadian users now have
                    access to the cheaper ad-supported tier. This next turn in
                    the streaming wars is going to get pricey.

                    The use of a shared certificate means that all connections
                    originating from Cloudflare are permitted, regardless of the
                    tenant initiating them.

                    A similar gap was identified in the 'Allowlist Cloudflare IP
                    addresses' on Network Layer mechanism, which blocks
                    connections originating from outside Cloudflare's IP ranges,
                    but permits all connections from within Cloudflare's

                    "An attacker can establish a custom domain with Cloudflare,
                    direct the DNS A record to the victims IP address. Next,
                    they disable all protection features for that custom domain
                    and route their attack(s) through Cloudflare's
                    infrastructure, effectively bypassing the protection
                    features that the victim has configured," Certitude

                    The consulting firm has published a proof-of-concept (PoC)
                    demonstration of these issues and recommends the use of
                    custom certificates for connection authentication and the
                    use of Cloudflare Aegis to mitigate the gaps.

                  <p>
                    Certitude says it reported the issues through Cloudflare's
                    bug bounty program in March, and that its report was marked
                    as 'informative' and closed without a fix. A Cloudflare

                    Over her three decades in the Senate, Feinstein transformed
                    from a barrier-breaking member of the Democratic Party's
                    liberal vanguard, championing the legalization of same-sex
                    marriage and a ban on assault-style weapons, to one of the
                    Washington's establishment members, esteemed by lawmakers on
                    both sides of the aisle but increasingly criticized by
                    outside progressives who argued that she refused to step
                    aside for the next generation.

                    In her final years, her work on Capitol Hill had also begun
                    to be overshadowed by concern

                    even as she insisted she remained a robust public servant,
                    despite her hospitalizations, reports of episodes of
                    confusion and other issues.

                  <p>
                    In announcing earlier this year that she planned to retire
                    at the end of her latest term, in 2025, Feinstein said:
                    "Each of us was sent here to solve problems. That's what
                    I've done for the last 30 years, and that's what I plan to
                    do for the next two years. My thanks to the people of
                    California for allowing me to serve them."

                  <p>
                    California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fellow Democrat, will now
                    appoint someone to serve out the remainder of Feinstein's
                    term, ahead of the 2024 race to succeed her. He has
                    committed to naming a Black woman -- who would then be only
                    the third such senator in history -- but has also said he
                    will not pick any of the candidates in the current
                    Democratic primary race, which includes Rep. Barbara Lee.

                    a significant update to ChatGPT that enables its GPT-3.5 and
                    GPT-4 AI models to analyze images and react to them as part
                    of a text conversation. Also, the ChatGPT mobile app will
                    add speech synthesis options that, when paired with its
                    existing speech recognition features, will enable fully
                    verbal conversations with the AI assistant, OpenAI says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    OpenAI is planning to roll out these features in ChatGPT to
                    Plus and Enterprise subscribers "over the next two weeks."
                    It also notes that speech synthesis is coming to iOS and
                    Android only, and image recognition will be available on
                    both the web interface and the mobile apps.<br />[...]<br />Despite
                    their drawbacks, in marketing materials, OpenAI is billing
                    these new features as giving ChatGPT the ability to "see,
                    hear, and speak." Not everyone is happy about the
                    anthropomorphism and potential hype language involved. On X,
                    Hugging Face AI researcher Dr. Sasha Luccioni
                    <a
                      href="https://x.com/SashaMTL/status/1706302354528555283?s=20"
                      >posted</a
                    >, "The always and forever PSA: stop treating AI models like
                    humans. No, ChatGPT cannot 'see, hear and speak.' It can be
                    integrated with sensors that will feed it information in
                    different modalities."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While ChatGPT and its associated AI models are clearly not
                    human—and hype is a very real thing in marketing—if the
                    updates perform as shown, they potentially represent a
                    significant expansion in capabilities for OpenAI's computer
                    assistant.

                    At CERN, an experiment investigated how gravity acts on
                    antimatter. General relativity predicts that all matter
                    follows gravitational attraction. However, recent decades in
                    cosmology raised enough questions about our understanding of
                    gravity. So, investigating the behavior of exotic matter is
                    necessary to confirm predictions from general relativity.
                    Antimatter has been available for quite a while; the first
                    positrons were created in 1932. Yet, measuring the effect of
                    gravity on charged particles is very difficult.
                    Gravitational force is much weaker than electromagnetic
                    force. The research team used anti-hydrogen (electrically
                    neutral) to observe the effect of gravity. And yes,
                    antihydrogen falls down.
