                    Then, over the weekend, we heard rumors that these layoffs

                    Now those rumors have been confirmed – though with a lower
                    number – in a company-wide email sent by Musk, which leaked
                    soon after it was sent.

                    had a rare year-over-year reduction in sales. While Tesla
                    does not break out sales by geographical region, the main
                    dip seems to have come from China, where Chinese EV makers
                    are ramping quickly both in the domestic and export market.

                Researchers have tracked muscle contractions in a bird's vocal
                tract, and reconstructed the song it was silently singing in its
                sleep. The resulting audio is a very specific call, allowing the
                team to figure out what the bird's dream was about.
              </p>
              <blockquote>

                    When birds sleep, the part of their brains dedicated to
                    daytime singing remains active, showing patterns that
                    resemble those produced while awake. Researchers from the
                    University of Buenos Aires (UBA) previously demonstrated
                    that these brain patterns activate a bird's vocal muscles,
                    enabling them to silently 'replay' a song during sleep.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, until now, it hasn't been possible to map how that
                    nocturnal activity gets processed. In their new study, the
                    UBA researchers turned the vocal muscle movements made
                    during avian dreaming into synthetic songs.
                  </p>

                    "Dreams are one of the most intimate and elusive parts of
                    our existence," said Gabriel Mindlin, a specialist in the
                    physical mechanisms behind birdsong and corresponding author
                    of the study. "Knowing that we share this with such a
                    distant species is very moving. And the possibility of
                    entering the mind of a dreaming bird – listening to how that
                    dream sounds – is a temptation impossible to resist."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A bird's vocal sounds are made by a unique organ only they
                    possess, the syrinx. Located at the base of the windpipe
                    (trachea), passing air causes some or all of the organ's
                    walls to vibrate, while a surrounding air sac acts like a
                    resonating chamber. The pitch of the sound produced depends
                    on the tension surrounding muscles exert on the syrinx and
                    the airways.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Custom-made electromyography (EMG) electrodes were
                    implanted in the birds to measure the muscle response and
                    electrical activity in the obliquus ventralis muscle, the
                    most prominent muscle producing the kiskadee's birdsong. EMG
                    and birdsong audio were recorded simultaneously while the
                    birds were awake and asleep. An existing dynamical systems
                    model of the kiskadee's sound production mechanism was used
                    to translate the information into synthetic songs. In basic
                    terms, a dynamical systems model breaks down what occurs in
                    the syrinx when sound is produced into a series of
                    mathematical equations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Analyzing muscular activity during sleep revealed
                    consistent activity patterns corresponding to the trills
                    produced by kiskadees during daytime territorial fights.
                    Interestingly, the 'dreaming trills' were associated with
                    raised head feathers, the same as during the daytime. The
                    researchers created a synthetic version of one of the trills
                    from the data they'd collected.

                    Highly capable hackers are rooting multiple corporate
                    networks by exploiting a maximum-severity zero-day
                    vulnerability in a firewall product from Palo Alto Networks,
                    researchers said Friday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The vulnerability, which has been under active exploitation
                    for at least two weeks now, allows the hackers with no
                    authentication to execute malicious code with root
                    privileges, the highest possible level of system access,
                    researchers said. The extent of the compromise, along with
                    the ease of exploitation, has earned the CVE-2024-3400
                    vulnerability the maximum severity rating of 10.0. The
                    ongoing attacks are the latest in a rash of attacks aimed at
                    firewalls, VPNs, and file-transfer appliances, which are
                    popular targets because of their wealth of vulnerabilities
                    and direct pipeline into the most sensitive parts of a
                    network.

                    The zero-day is present in PAN-OS 10.2, PAN-OS 11.0, and/or

                    with subscriptions to the company's Threat Prevention
                    service and ensuring vulnerability protection has been
                    applied to their GlobalProtect interface. When that's not
                    possible, customers should temporarily disable telemetry
                    until a patch is available.

                    Volexity, the security firm that discovered the zero-day
                    attacks, said that it's currently unable to tie the
                    attackers to any previously known groups. However, based on
                    the resources required and the organizations targeted, they
                    are "highly capable" and likely backed by a nation-state. So
                    far, only a single threat group—which Volexity tracks as
                    UTA0218—is known to be leveraging the vulnerability in
                    limited attacks. The company warned that as new groups learn
                    of the vulnerability, CVE-2024-3400, is likely to come under
                    mass exploitation, just as recent zero-days affecting

                    [...] The earliest attacks Volexity has seen took place on
                    March 26 in what company researchers suspect was UTA0218
                    testing the vulnerability by placing zero-byte files on
                    firewall devices to validate exploitability. On April 7, the
                    researchers observed the group trying unsuccessfully to
                    install a backdoor on a customer's firewall. Three days
                    later, the group's attacks were successfully deploying
                    malicious payloads. Since then, the threat group has
                    deployed custom, never-before-seen post-exploitation
                    malware. The backdoor, which is written in the Python
                    language, allows the attackers to use specially crafted
                    network requests to execute additional commands on hacked
                    devices.

                    Tesla warns owners that opening their doors or windows while
                    installing a software update could damage the vehicle, so
                    she stayed put
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the Tesla owner's manual, "Vehicle functions,
                    including some safety systems and opening or closing the
                    doors or windows, may be limited or disabled when
                    installation is in progress and you could damage the
                    vehicle." Janel chose to heed Tesla's warning and did not
                    attempt to open her doors or windows during the installation
                    process for fear of damaging her vehicle, but this seems
                    like a very dangerous oversight on Tesla's part that she was
                    able to be stuck inside at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The door mechanisms on the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y are
                    electrically operated, and under normal circumstances are
                    opened from the inside using a simple button to unlatch the
                    door. Should the vehicle have no power, these models do have
                    auxiliary manual cable release levers also found on the door
                    panel, but Tesla warns against using the manual mechanism,
                    citing that it should only be used when the car has no
                    power. Janel said she was aware of this option but didn't
                    want to risk damaging her car, and she felt confident that
                    she could stick out the heat.

                    In contrast to Tesla's potentially dangerous warnings, Lucid
                    Motors requires all occupants to exit the vehicle before the
                    installation process begins, and the Lucid Air owners manual
                    states that owners will not be able to lock or unlock the
                    doors during an update. The Air will start a two-minute
                    countdown when an owner chooses to install an update, giving
                    them enough time to get out prior to the update beginning.

                    The sense of touch has immense importance for many aspects
                    of our life. It is the first of all the senses to develop in
                    newborns and the most direct experience of contact with our
                    physical and social environment. Complementing our own touch
                    experience, we also regularly receive touch from others
                    around us, for example, through consensual hugs, kisses or
                    massages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The recent coronavirus pandemic has raised awareness
                    regarding the need to better understand the effects that
                    touch—and its reduction during social distancing—can have on
                    our mental and physical well-being. The most common touch
                    interventions, for example, massage for adults or kangaroo
                    care for newborns, have been shown to have a wide range of
                    both mental and physical health benefits, from facilitating
                    growth and development to buffering against anxiety and
                    stress, over the lifespan of humans and animals alike. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A critical issue highlighted in the pandemic was the lack of
                    touch due to social restrictions. To accommodate the need
                    for touch in individuals with small social networks (for
                    example, institutionalized or isolated individuals), touch
                    interventions using objects/robots have been explored in the
                    past (for a review, see ref. 11). We show here that touch
                    interactions outside of the human–human domain are
                    beneficial for mental and physical health outcomes. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In conclusion, we show clear evidence that touch
                    interventions are beneficial across a large number of both
                    physical and mental health outcomes, for both healthy and
                    clinical cohorts, and for all ages. These benefits, while
                    influenced in their magnitude by study cohorts and
                    intervention characteristics, were robustly present,
                    promoting the conclusion that touch interventions can be
                    systematically employed across the population to preserve
                    and improve our health.

                    An international team of researchers led by groups from the
                    Max Planck Institute in Marburg and Phillips University in
                    Marburg has now discovered the first regular molecular
                    fractal in nature. They discovered a microbial
                    enzyme—citrate synthase from a cyanobacterium—that
                    spontaneously assembles into a regular fractal pattern known
                    as the Sierpiński triangle. This is an infinitely repeating
                    series of triangles made up of smaller triangles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We stumbled on this structure completely by accident and
                    almost couldn't believe what we saw when we first took
                    images of it using an electron microscope," says first
                    author Franziska Sendker.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The protein makes these beautiful triangles and as the
                    fractal grows, we see these larger and larger triangular
                    voids in the middle of them, which is totally unlike any
                    protein assembly we've ever seen before," she continues.

                    Because of Apple's restrictions, iMessage only works if you
                    have an iPhone in the mix, Migicovsky says, and will not be
                    a focus for Beeper, given the complications it saw with
                    Apple's shutdown of Beeper Mini. However, Beeper is hopeful
                    regulations could change things, pointing to the DoJ lawsuit
                    and

                  <p>
                    [...] The team expects to have feature parity across
                    platforms in a matter of months as they overhaul the iOS and
                    desktop apps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In time, they plan to add other services to Beeper as well,
                    including Google Voice, Snapchat, and Microsoft Teams.
                    Beeper also offers a widget API so developers can build on
                    top of Beeper. Plus, since Matrix is an open standard,
                    developers will be able to build alternative clients for
                    Beeper, as well.

                    The app will generate revenue via a premium subscription,
                    where the final price may be a couple of dollars per month,
                    but pricing decisions haven't yet been fully nailed down.
                    Beeper is currently free to use.

                    [...] Unsurprisingly, Epic's proposed injunction includes an
                    "anti-retaliation" section specifically aimed at protecting
                    Epic from any further retaliation. If Donato accepts the
                    terms, Google would be violating the injunction order if the
                    tech giant fails to prove that it is not "treating Epic
                    differently than other developers" by making it
                    "disproportionately difficult or costly" for Epic to
                    develop, update, and market its apps on Android.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That part of the injunction would seem important since, last
                    month, Epic
                    <a
                      href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1770500825166545305/photo/1"

                    >
                    that an Epic Games Store was "coming to iOS and Android"
                    later this year.
                    <a
                      href="https://www.inc.com/kit-eaton/epic-games-reveals-eu-app-store-for-apple-devices-keeps-its-third-party-fee.html#:~:text=That%20means%20Epic%20will%20charge,these%20are%20fair%20terms."
                      >According to Inc</a
                    >, Epic told Game Developers Conference attendees that its
                    app-distribution platform will be the "first ever
                    game-focused, multiplatform store," working across "Android,
                    iOS, PC and macOS."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Under the proposed injunction, Google would be
                    restricted from introducing any unnecessary steps that might
                    keep users from quickly accessing third-party app stores
                    "beyond the steps required to access the Google Play Store
                    when it is preinstalled."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But otherwise, "Google must allow consumers to
                    download apps from wherever they choose without
                    interference, whether it's from the Google Play Store, a
                    third-party app store, another app, or the web," Epic's blog
                    said. "Under Epic's proposed injunction, Google can't use
                    scare screens and dire warnings that deter consumers from
                    downloading apps from the Internet to their phones."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Epic additionally wants Google to be blocked from seeking
                    pretty much any form of exclusivity for the Google Play
                    Store. That partly means Google wouldn't be able to share
                    revenue from the Play Store with distributors to stop
                    competing app stores from being preinstalled or placed on a
                    device's home screen. They also wouldn't be able to pay
                    developers to exclusively launch or distribute apps through
                    Google Play, including restricting any agreements on special
                    pricing in the Google Play Store. Additionally, Google
                    couldn't stop developers from removing apps from Google Play
                    without Google's consent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Google has a history of malicious compliance and has
                    attempted to circumvent legislation and regulation meant to
                    rein in their anti-competitive control over Android
                    devices," Epic's blog said. "Our proposed injunction seeks
                    to block Google from repeating past bad-faith tactics and
                    open up Android devices to competition and choice for all
                    developers and consumers."

                For those times when you have nothing to do for the next six

                For those times when the 9 hour movie trilogy wasn't long
                enough. I guess they have less special effects to hide behind.

                    experience" by temporarily removing links to California news
                    websites for "a small percentage of users." That means links
                    to California news websites, like SFGATE, may not appear in
                    Google searches for some users.

                    [...] Wicks' bill is meant to provide a financial lifeline
                    for news outlets that have struggled to compete for ad
                    dollars — a major funding source for them — in the digital

                    The "journalism usage fee" would be determined by an
                    arbitration process, and an eligible outlet would have to
                    spend at least 70% of the new dollars on hiring additional
                    journalists and support staff.

                    also a co-author on the latest paper, models predicted that
                    the dense layer of titanium-rich material beneath the crust
                    first migrated to the near side of the moon, possibly
                    triggered by a giant impact on the far side, and then sunk
                    into the interior in a network of sheetlike slabs, cascading
                    into the lunar interior almost like waterfalls. But when
                    that material sank, it left behind a small remnant in a
                    geometric pattern of intersecting linear bodies of dense
                    titanium-rich material beneath the crust.

                    "When we saw those model predictions, it was like a
                    lightbulb went on," said Andrews-Hanna, "because we see the
                    exact same pattern when we look at subtle variations in the
                    moon's gravity field, revealing a network of dense material
                    lurking below the crust."

                    [...] "For the first time we have physical evidence showing
                    us what was happening in the moon's interior during this
                    critical stage in its evolution, and that's really
                    exciting," Andrews-Hanna said. "It turns out that the moon's
                    earliest history is written below the surface, and it just
                    took the right combination of models and data to unveil that

                    "The vestiges of early lunar evolution are present below the

                    It might be the end of the road for two of NASA's most
                    iconic telescopes as the space agency looks to reduce the
                    funding for the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-Ray
                    Observatory, much to the dismay of scientists who rely
                    heavily on the cosmic observations of the missions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shortly after the fate of its 2024 budget was sealed, NASA
                    released its budget proposal for 2025, requesting $1.58
                    billion for its astrophysics division. Despite the 3%
                    increase from what the space agency received this year to
                    spend on astrophysics research, it represents a small
                    reduction in the amount spent on Hubble and a major
                    downgrade for Chandra's budget.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The proposed budget for Hubble Space Telescope in 2025 is
                    $88.9 million, a slight decrease from $98.3 million in 2024,
                    while the Chandra X-Ray Observatory would drop from $68.3
                    million in 2023 to $41.1 million in 2025 and a further
                    reduction to $26.6 million the following year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The reduction to Chandra will start orderly mission
                    drawdown to minimal operations," the budget document read.
                    In its budget request, NASA argues that the Chandra
                    spacecraft "has been degrading over its mission lifetime to
                    the extent that several systems require active management to
                    keep temperatures within acceptable ranges for spacecraft
                    operations. This makes scheduling and the post processing of
                    data more complex, increasing mission management costs
                    beyond what NASA can currently afford."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Patrick Slane, director of the Chandra X-ray Center,
                    responded in a statement, arguing that, while temperatures
                    of the spacecraft have been increasing, the team has
                    "developed thermal models and processes to manage this
                    situation and have done so with amazing success—experiencing
                    little or no decrease in observing efficiency, which far
                    exceeds the initial requirements for the mission."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the statement, Slane also expressed confusion over NASA's
                    claim of increasing costs, recalling that there was only one
                    instance in which the Chandra mission requested two
                    additional people on the flight team, resulting in a 1%
                    increase in cost in 2022.

                    Maine has a long, proud history as a papermaking state and a
                    long, tortured history with the industry's

                    compounds—per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS—began
                    to be used in the papermaking process. The chemicals were
                    miracle workers: A small amount of PFAS could make paper
                    plates and food containers both grease-proof and
                    water-resistant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, in the '80s, the state encouraged spreading sewage
                    sludge on fields as fertilizer, a seemingly smart use of an
                    otherwise cumbersome by-product of living, hard to manage in
                    a landfill. In principle, human manure can sub in for animal
                    manure without much compromise. But in reality, sludge often
                    contains a cocktail of

                    where we grow food. The initial idea is not great," Apul
                    told me. The Saunderses first found out that the
                    sludge-spreading had contaminated their water after the
                    state found high PFAS levels in

                    two miles away. Maine's limit for six kinds of PFAS was 20
                    parts per trillion; state toxicologists found so much in the
                    Saunderses' well water that when Nathan worked out the
                    average of all the tests taken in 2021, it came to 14,800
                    parts per trillion, he told me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nathan used to work as an engineer for Maine's
                    drinking-water-safety program, and he quickly pieced
                    together the story of their street's contamination and just
                    how bad it was. After state researchers tested their blood,
                    Nathan remembers, a doctor told him that his levels of one
                    PFAS were so high, they had hit the maximum the test could
                    reliably report—2,000 micrograms per liter. So far, he's
                    healthy, but he feels like he's living on borrowed time.
                    Diseases related to environmental exposures can take decades
                    to emerge, and although studies show that PFAS may degrade
                    health at a population level, why some individuals fall ill
                    and others don't isn't always clear. Cordelia told me that
                    the neighbor who wouldn't eat the peaches is now on three
                    medications for high cholesterol (which has been linked to
                    PFAS), and that other neighbors have bladder or brain
                    cancer.

                    [...] Several labs across the country are trying to find a
                    way to unmake these chemicals, using foam fractionation,
                    soil washing, mineralization, electron-beam radiation. David
                    Hanigan, an environmental engineer at the University of
                    Nevada at Reno, is

                    whether burning PFAS at ultrahigh temperatures can break the
                    carbon-fluorine bond completely. He once thought that PFAS
                    researchers were out of their minds to be testing such
                    wildly expensive solutions, he told me. But he's realized
                    that PFAS are just that tough, and as a scientist, he thinks
                    the original manufacturers of PFAS must have understood
                    that. "It's upsetting from an organic-chemistry standpoint,"
                    he told me. Any chemist would have known that these
                    compounds would persist in the environment, he said. Indeed,

                    The vulnerability makes it possible for hackers to identify
                    memory addresses responsible for handling key functions.
                    Operating systems take pains to randomize and conceal these
                    locations so they can't be used in software exploits. By
                    chaining an exploit for the lighttpd vulnerability with a
                    separate vulnerability, hackers could defeat this standard
                    protection, which is known as

                    Tracking the supply chain for multiple BMCs used in multiple
                    server hardware is difficult. So far, Binarly has identified
                    AMI's MegaRAC BMC as one of the vulnerable BMCs. The
                    security firm has confirmed that the AMI BMC is contained in

                    hardware. Information about BMCs from ATEN or hardware from
                    Lenovo and Supermicro aren't available at the moment. The
                    vulnerability is present in any hardware that uses lighttpd
                    versions 1.4.35, 1.4.45, and 1.4.51.

                  <p>
                    Attempts to immediately reach lighttpd developers and most
                    of the makers of affected hardware weren't immediately
                    successful. An AMI representative declined to comment on the
                    vulnerability but added the standard statements about
                    security being an important priority.

                  <p>
                    The lighttpd flaw is what's known as a heap out-of-bounds

                    parsing logic. Hackers can exploit it using maliciously

                    [...] According to Zuazo, person-specific biometric data
                    such as iris specs are "ultra-sensitive" and could
                    theoretically be employed for nefarious identification
                    purposes.

                    The authors examined the idea of aerial biospheres and how
                    the detection of CHNOPS plays into them. They introduced the
                    concept of nutrient availability levels in exoplanet
                    atmospheres. In their framework, the presence of water is
                    required regardless of other nutrient availability. "We
                    considered any atmosphere without water condensates as
                    uninhabitable," they write, a nod to water's primacy. The
                    researchers assigned different levels of habitability based
                    on the presence and amounts of the CHNOPS nutrients.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To explore their framework of nutrient availability, the
                    researchers turned to simulations. The simulated atmospheres
                    held different levels of nutrients, and the researchers
                    applied their concept of nutrient availability. Their
                    results aim to understand not habitability but the chemical
                    potential for habitability. A planet's atmosphere can be
                    altered drastically by life, and this research aims to
                    understand the atmospheric potential for life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our approach does not directly aim for the understanding of
                    biosignatures and atmospheres of planets, which are
                    inhabited, but for the conditions in which pre-biotic
                    chemistry can occur," they write. In their work, the minimum
                    atmospheric concentration for a nutrient to be available is
                    10<sup>9</sup>, or one ppb (part per billion.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We find that for most atmospheres at ( p gas, T gas)
                    points, where liquid water is stable, CNS-bearing molecules
                    are present at concentrations above 10<sup>9</sup>," they
                    write. They also found that carbon is generally present in
                    every simulated atmosphere and that sulfur availability
                    increases with surface temperature. With lower surface
                    temperatures, nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>) is
                    present in increasing amounts. But with higher surface
                    temperatures, nitrogen can become depleted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Phosphorus is a different matter. "The limiting element of
                    the CHNOPS elements is phosphorus, which is mostly bound in
                    the planetary crust," they write. The authors point out
                    that, at past times in Earth's atmosphere, phosphorus
                    scarcity limited the biosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An aerial biosphere is an interesting idea. But it's not the
                    main thrust of scientists' efforts to detect exoplanet
                    atmospheres. Surface life is their holy grail. It should be
                    no surprise that it still comes down to liquid water, all
                    things considered. "Similar to previous work, our models
                    suggest that the limiting factor for habitability at the
                    surface of a planet is the presence of liquid water," the
                    authors write. In their work, when surface water was
                    available, CNS was available in the lower atmosphere near
                    the surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But surface water plays several roles in atmospheric
                    chemistry. It can bond with some nutrients in some
                    circumstances, making them unavailable, and in other
                    circumstances, it can make them available.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If water is available at the surface, the elements not
                    present in the gas phase are stored in the crust
                    condensates," the authors write. Chemical weathering can
                    then make them available as nutrients. "This provides a
                    pathway to overcome the lack of atmospheric phosphorus and
                    metals, which are used in enzymes that drive many biological
                    processes."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This complicates matters on worlds covered by oceans.
                    Pre-biotic molecules might not be available if there's no
                    opportunity for water and rock to interact with the
                    atmosphere. "If indeed it can be shown that life can form in
                    a water ocean without any exposed land, this constraint
                    becomes weaker, and the potential for the surface
                    habitability becomes mainly a question of water stability,"
                    the authors write.

                    Inspired by the footpads of desert-traversing camels,
                    Bridgestone's first-generation lunar rover tire integrated a
                    soft, metal-based felt material into the tread area to
                    enhance traction on the moon's regolith surface.

                  <p>
                    Building on this foundation, the second-generation tire
                    introduces a robust skeletal structure, incorporating thin
                    metal spokes and segmented tread design. These advancements,
                    facilitated by structural simulations and digital
                    technologies, are designed for durability and traction in
                    the harsh lunar environment – characterized by rocks, sand,
                    vacuum conditions and temperature fluctuations.

                I'm not sure what camels have to do with anything except hype,

                Airless tires are nothing new, they existed before pneumatic
                tires. Looking at the pics in this short history, it's easy to
                see why they never went into large production -- complex and
                heavy -- but plenty of inventors tried,

                  <p>
                    It's been twelve years since the big SOPA (Stop Online
                    Piracy Act) /PIPA (Protect IP Act) fight. I've been talking
                    with a few folks lately about how it feels like many people
                    have either forgotten that story or weren't paying attention
                    when it happened. Two years ago, we did a 10-year
                    retrospective on the fight, and it feels like some people
                    need a refresher. Most notably, Charles Rivkin, the head of
                    the MPA (formerly the MPAA), certainly appears to need a
                    refresher because he just announced it's time to bring back
                    SOPA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the young ones in the audience, SOPA (and its Senate
                    companion, PIPA) were bills pushed strongly by the film
                    (MPA) and recording (RIAA) industries. They were pushing for
                    "site blocking" for websites that the industries accused of
                    being "dedicated to piracy." The law was a slam dunk. It had
                    a huge number of co-sponsors, and the MPA/RIAA combo had
                    convinced Congress to pass ever more expansive copyright
                    laws basically every two to three years for the past 25
                    years. SOPA was set to become law.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Until it wasn't. Because the public spoke up loudly. I
                    (coincidentally) was at the Capitol on the day of the big
                    Internet Blackout in protest of SOPA/PIPA, and I heard the
                    phones ringing off the hook. I was running up and down the
                    halls of the office buildings, having Reps. tell me how they
                    were removing their names from the co-sponsor list. The
                    public spoke up and it worked.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it's important to remember why it worked: because the
                    law was a horrific attack on free speech and the open web.
                    And for no good reason.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We spent much time explaining why this would be a clear
                    violation of the First Amendment. Under the First Amendment,
                    you cannot shut down an entire publishing house just because
                    it sometimes has published works that contain, say,
                    defamation. You cannot ban access to a photocopying machine
                    because some users use it to infringe. SOPA was basically
                    built-in prior restraint.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can only target the actually violative content and not
                    declare entire sites be blocked. That goes way beyond what
                    the First Amendment allows.

                    [...] To provide directional information from a stationary
                    device without getting too close, researchers use an array
                    of detector grids along with another grid called a mask,
                    which imprints a pattern on the array that differs depending
                    on the direction of the source. An algorithm interprets the
                    different timings and intensities of signals received by
                    each separate detector or pixel. This often leads to a
                    complex design of detectors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Typical detector arrays for sensing the direction of
                    radiation sources are large and expensive and include at
                    least 100 pixels in a 10 by 10 array. However, the group
                    found that using as few as four pixels arranged in the
                    tetromino shapes of the figures in the "Tetris" game can
                    come close to matching the accuracy of the large, expensive
                    systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The key is a proper computerized reconstruction of the
                    angles of arrival of the rays, based on the times each
                    sensor detects the signal and the relative intensity each
                    one detects, as reconstructed through an AI-guided study of
                    simulated systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of the different configurations of four pixels, the
                    researchers tried—square, S-, J- or T-shaped—they found
                    through repeated experiments that the S-shaped array
                    provided the most precise results. This array gave
                    directional readings that were accurate to within about 1
                    degree, but all three of the irregular shapes performed
                    better than the square. This approach, Li says, "was
                    literally inspired by Tetris."
                  </p>

                    [...] In a single-blind field test at the Berkeley Lab with
                    a real cesium radiation source, led by Vavrek, where the
                    researchers at MIT did not know the ground-truth source
                    location, a test device was performed with high accuracy in
                    finding the direction and distance to the source.

                    performance in AI workloads, with 45 of those TOPS coming
                    from the NPU alone. That's 3X the AI performance of Intel's

                    session with <em>Tom's Hardware</em>, also said that

                  <p>
                    Intel's current-gen Meteor Lake chips only provide 10 TOPS
                    of performance from the NPU, falling below the bar for
                    next-gen AI PCs. Lunar Lake's 45 TOPS from the NPU meets
                    that bar exactly. Gelsinger didn't elaborate on how much of
                    the remaining 55+ TOPS comes from the CPU and GPU, but it's
                    reasonable to expect in the range of 50 TOPS from the GPU
                    and 5 to 10 FLOPS from the CPU cores.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AMD's current-gen Ryzen Hawk Point platform has an NPU with
                    16 TOPS of performance, which also falls below the bar for
                    next-gen AI PCs. However, the company recently sent us a
                    statement regarding its next-gen products:

                      current generation. We believe this performance will

                    AMD wouldn't elaborate further and break out the amount of
                    performance delivered from each unit, but simple math puts
                    AMD's Strix Point NPU at 48 TOPS if NPU performance triples.

                Several sites are reporting on the European Court of Human
                Rights' decision that failure to cut greenhouse gas emissions is
                a violation of our basic human rights. Specifically holding
                global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, in line
                with the goals of the Paris climate agreement, is a necessary
                step in preventing the serious, adverse effects on their lives,
                health, well-being, and quality of life which come with the
                direction climate change has been moving.

                    On Tuesday, a group of 2,000 Swiss women won a significant
                    ruling on holding governments accountable for addressing
                    climate change.

                    The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) found that
                    Switzerland failed to implement sufficient climate policies
                    — violating the women's human rights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The case could influence other European countries, as well
                    as other international bodies, in their decisions about the
                    legal ramifications of inadequate climate policies.

                    In a historic judgement, the court ruled that Switzerland's
                    failure to do enough to cut its greenhouse gas emissions
                    breached the rights to life and respect for family and

                    Peregrine falcon populations across North America are
                    heavily contaminated with harmful flame retardants–including
                    those that have been phased out for years—according to a new
                    study
                    <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c10907"

                    Flame retardants are chemicals added to furniture,
                    electronics, and other everyday products to meet
                    flammability standards, though they often do not work as
                    intended. They also migrate out of products they are added
                    to and end up in wildlife and people and many are linked to
                    serious health and environmental harms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our results expose the long-term consequences of adding
                    flame retardants to consumer products," said senior author
                    Da Chen, a scientist at Jinan University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "As globally distributed apex predators, the peregrine
                    falcon is the ideal canary in the coal mine for monitoring
                    flame retardant pollution in the environment. Flame
                    retardants phased out a decade ago are still accumulating in
                    these birds and into their eggs, which indicates that the
                    threats of these chemicals to wildlife and people can far
                    outlast their production."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Continued exposure to old flame retardants comes from
                    the release of these chemicals from in-use and discarded
                    products produced before the phase-outs. Further, many flame
                    retardants released from products accumulate up marine and
                    terrestrial food chains over time, making apex predators
                    like peregrine falcons more likely to build up high
                    concentrations in their tissues. The flame retardants also
                    end up in their eggs through maternal transfer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Concentrations of the unregulated halogenated flame
                    retardants measured by the research team stayed constant or
                    declined throughout the study period, suggesting that
                    non-halogenated flame retardants and polymeric flame
                    retardants are more popular as replacements. Unfortunately,
                    those too are increasingly linked to human and wildlife
                    health harms.

                the BBC story, your AC submitter thought it wise to redact that

                    New findings by Johns Hopkins University engineers working
                    with a high-tech simulation of schooling mackerel, offer
                    insight into why fish swim in schools and promise for the
                    design and operation of much quieter submarines and
                    autonomous undersea vehicles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's widely known that swimming in groups provides fish
                    with added protection from predators, but we questioned
                    whether it also contributes to reducing their noise," said
                    senior author Rajat Mittal. "Our results suggest that the
                    substantial decrease in their acoustic signature when
                    swimming in groups, compared to solo swimming, may indeed be
                    another factor driving the formation of fish schools."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The work is
                    <a

                    in <em>Bioinspiration &amp; Biomimetics</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team created a 3D model based on the common mackerel to
                    simulate different numbers of fish swimming, changing up
                    their formations, how close they swam to one another, and
                    the degrees to which their movements synched. The model,
                    which applies to many fish species, simulates one to nine
                    mackerel being propelled forward by their tail fins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team found that a school of fish moving together in just
                    the right way was stunningly effective at noise reduction: A
                    school of seven fish sounded like a single fish.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "A predator, such as a shark, may perceive it as hearing a
                    lone fish instead of a group," Mittal said. "This could have
                    significant implications for prey fish."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The single biggest key to sound reduction, the team found,
                    was the synchronization of the school's tail flapping—or
                    actually the lack thereof.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If fish moved in unison, flapping their tail fins at the
                    same time, the sound added up and there was no reduction in
                    total sound. But if they alternated tail flaps, the fish
                    canceled out each other's sound, the researchers found.

                  <p>
                    According to Tesla lawyer Thomas Branigan, the settlement
                    amount could be perceived "as evidence of Tesla's potential
                    liability for losses, which may have a chilling effect on
                    settlement opportunity in subsequent cases." Branigan said
                    Tesla would suffer serious injury if the settlement amount
                    was not withheld, and his motion appears to have been
                    granted based on court documents.

                    There's plenty of unknowns in a situation like this, in
                    which Tesla chose to settle the matter a mere day before
                    jury selection was set to begin. Nonetheless, it's the first
                    settlement in an Autopilot-related case for Tesla, which so
                    far has prevailed in court on both cases that went before a
                    jury.

                    A leading gravitational wave observatory recently detected
                    ripples in spacetime that scientists say came from the
                    collision of a dead, superdense stellar remnant and an
                    unknown object.

                  <p>
                    The stellar remnant is what’s called a neutron star; it’s
                    what is left when a massive star collapses, leaving only a
                    dense core behind. Neutron stars are some of the densest
                    objects in the universe, with intense gravitational
                    fields—but not as intense as black holes, whose gravity is
                    so strong that not even light can escape their event
                    horizons.

                    following some upgrades that reduced the amount of noise in
                    the detector, improving its sensitivity to the subtle
                    perturbations of spacetime.

                  <p>
                    The unique gravitational wave signal travelled 650 million
                    light-years to get to the LIGO Livingston Observatory in
                    Louisiana. Researchers determined the signal came from the
                    merger of two objects. One of the objects was between 1.2
                    and 2 times the mass of our Sun, and the other was about 2.5
                    to 4.5 solar masses. The signal is dubbed GW230529_181500,
                    or GW230529 for short.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The smaller object, the astrophysicists concluded, is
                    probably a neutron star. But the larger object is more
                    massive than any known neutron star, indicating that it may
                    be an itsy-bitsy black hole. Their paper describing the
                    signal and its likely origins is
                    <a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/P2300352/public/"
                      >currently hosted</a
                    >
                    on the LIGO website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The unknown object occupies the apparent mass gap that
                    exists between the heaviest known neutron star and the
                    lightest black hole. Further scrutiny of the collision will
                    indicate whether the unknown object is a low-mass black
                    hole, as the team suspects, or something else.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There are still 80 significant signal candidates that
                    the team needs to sift through. So there are heady days
                    ahead for observing the gravitational universe.

                    In most cases (68 percent), organizations don't deem the
                    incidents significant enough to report to anyone. Other
                    excuses included not knowing where to report incidents (13
                    percent of businesses), thinking a report would make no
                    difference (9 percent), and incidents being too recent to
                    allow time to report (4 percent).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for the action taken, as many as 39 percent of businesses
                    took no action following their most disruptive breach in the
                    previous 12 months. Most defaulted to delivering more
                    training to staff (23 percent), with a much smaller
                    proportion making any changes to

                    (9 percent) or anti-malware solutions (8 percent).

                  <p>
                    Small and micro businesses appear to be pulling the figures
                    down considerably. Overall, 59 percent of businesses enacted
                    some sort of organizational change following a breach, but
                    medium and large businesses were much more likely to take
                    action, with 74 and 86 percent of each respectively doing
                    something to prevent further intrusions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Breaches that resulted in material outcomes for victims,
                    such as the theft of data, led to slightly different
                    results. A greater diversity of measures were enacted by
                    businesses and charities in this case, such as introducing
                    new security tools, but still, 18 percent of businesses did
                    absolutely nothing in response, even after a material
                    breach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In the event of a breach, businesses are not keeping
                    records, not informing the police or regulators, not
                    assessing the scale and impact of the incident," said Kays.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "They are failing to do the bare minimum. It's also
                    important to note that businesses are doing very little to
                    prevent or detect breaches in the first place."

                  <p>
                    Figures from DSIT's survey also showed a general decrease in
                    awareness of security initiatives and willingness to seek
                    support.

                The invasive cannonball jellyfish is filling fishermen's nets,
                in a surge the environment ministry attributes to warming waters
                from climate change and a decline in jellyfish predators such as
                sharks and sea turtles.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, "sardines and other species that serve as
                fishing bait have disappeared. Fishing is at its lowest level in
                years," said Gustavo Carrasquel, of the NGO Azul Ambientalistas,
                who lives in Choroni, a town neighboring Chuao.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] Globally, jellyfish populations have soared. Researchers
                have warned of a tipping point in which the oceans could go from
                being dominated by fish populations, to jellyfish -- mostly as a
                result of overfishing.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] In Chuao, fishermen who would bring in between 3,000 and
                5,000 kilograms a week have seen their yields drop to between
                500 and 1,000 kilograms, said Douglas Martinez, 44, a fisherman.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mayora said that Venezuela should draw inspiration from
                countries such as Mexico, which exploits jellyfish commercially,
                exporting it to Asian countries where it is used in gastronomy
                or the pharmaceutical industry.

                    OEM Sales, likely sent this notification to direct business
                    partners. However, it's certainly just as important for
                    consumers moving into 2024. Higher-than-expected demand
                    combined with supply constraints have pushed us out of the
                    era of dirt-cheap storage now, as was rumored last fall.
                    Hopefully, the increased prices won't last too long.

                    TW's sources point toward HDD pricing increasing by as much
                    as 10%, with a minimum 5% pricing increase expected. There
                    are no hard numbers for NAND flash pricing, but NAND prices
                    were already heading up and we expect further pricing
                    increases could be in line with HDDs, if not worse.

                    Dolphins and whales use sound to communicate, navigate and
                    hunt. New research suggests that the collections of fatty
                    tissue that enable toothed whales to do so may have evolved
                    from their skull muscles and bone marrow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists at Hokkaido University determined DNA sequences
                    of genes which were expressed in acoustic fat
                    bodies—collections of fat around the head that toothed
                    whales use for echolocation. They measured gene expression
                    in the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) and Pacific
                    white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens). Their
                    findings were published in the journal Gene.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The evolution of acoustic fat bodies in the head—the melon
                    in the whale forehead, extramandibular fat bodies (EMFB)
                    alongside the jawbone, and intramandibular fat bodies (IMFB)
                    within the jawbone—was essential for sound use such as
                    echolocation. However, little is known about the genetic
                    origins of those fatty tissues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Toothed whales have undergone significant degenerations and
                    adaptations to their aquatic lifestyle," said Hayate
                    Takeuchi, a Ph.D. student at Hokkaido University's Hayakawa
                    Lab and first author of the study. One adaptation was the
                    partial loss of their sense of smell and taste, along with
                    the gain of echolocation to enable them to navigate in the
                    underwater environment.<br />...<br />"This study has
                    revealed that the evolutionary tradeoff of masticatory
                    muscles for the EMFB—between auditory and feeding
                    ecology—was crucial in the aquatic adaptation of toothed
                    whales," said Assistant Professor Takashi Hayakawa of the
                    Faculty of Environmental Earth Science, who led the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It was part of the evolutionary shift away from chewing to
                    simply swallowing food, which meant the chewing muscles were
                    no longer needed."

                    Canadian telecom Bell Canada has been pushing its
                    cloud-based DVR service to its Fibe TV subscribers for
                    years. While it has given customers advantages, like the
                    ability to view their recordings from more devices, such as
                    phones, compared to using local DVR storage, users don't
                    have as much control over the recordings as they thought
                    they had.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On May 1, Fibe TV will automatically delete recordings
                    stored on its Cloud PVR (personal video recorder) offering
                    once the recordings hit 61 days of age, as confirmed by
                    Canadian online newspaper Daily Hive. Currently, customers
                    maintain access to recordings stored via Cloud PVR for 365
                    days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A Bell Canada spokesperson, Jacqueline Michelis,
                    minimized the idea of disruption to customers, telling Daily
                    Hive: "The viewing of nearly all recordings takes place
                    within 60 days, so there is minimal impact to customers."
                    Michelis didn't provide more details on how Bell Canada
                    arrived at this conclusion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Customers have turned to Bell Canada's online support
                    forum to share their discontent with the changes, with some
                    saying that they don't align with the services they expected
                    to receive when signing up for Fibe TV. Thankfully, Bell
                    Canada won't be able to delete recordings stored on DVR
                    hardware inside customers' homes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other complaints are coming from users whose recordings are
                    being deleted even when they haven't come close to maxing
                    out their cloud storage or if their recordings aren't
                    available on demand.

                    This all happened within 60 to 90 seconds. Similar results
                    were seen with cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) when the
                    tip of one antenna was severed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In both species of insects, after the hemolymph retracted, a
                    clot began to form. The scab from this clot became so tough
                    in cockroaches that even a tungsten needle could not
                    penetrate it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] How fast can hemocytes start assembling? The team went
                    back and observed viscous but not hardened hemolymph oozing
                    from wounds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While bleeding stopped by around a minute, hemocytes started
                    to form a scab around three minutes after the formation of
                    the last drop, which retracted after turning into a
                    viscoelastic fluid with polymers strong enough to thicken it
                    and hold it back. Some hemocytes would form pseudopodia
                    (much like amoebas do), which then attached to other
                    hemocytes. The aggregates that resulted made the fluid more
                    and more viscous and eventually formed a scab.

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Once upon a time, 60 years ago, IBM (International Business
                    Machines) presented a computer architecture that was
                    revolutionary at the time: the IBM System/360. The IBM
                    System/360 was officially unveiled on April 7, 1964, when
                    modern PCs and server technology for supercomputers were
                    still unthinkable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Decades before Windows, 3.5-inch hard disks, CDs or SSDs,
                    IBM had been developing a computer architecture since 1961
                    that the company referred to as the "5 billion dollar
                    gamble". An investment that would either secure IBM's future
                    or destroy the company's specialized computer business. At
                    that time, IBM was producing computers specifically for one
                    application (to put it simply). Upgrades were expensive and
                    required lots of resources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the bet paid off and IBM's System/360 became a success
                    with what are now absurdly puny performance figures by
                    today's standards. The RAM? From 8 KByte as the minimum up
                    to a luxurious 524 KByte as the maximum. This was actually a
                    lot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To put this into perspective: the Atari 2600 console, which
                    appeared over a decade later, had just 128 bytes of RAM.
                    Yes, that's right, 128 characters for the RAM. It wasn't
                    until a few years later that so-called "superchips" in the
                    cartridges made it possible to multiply the RAM. And even
                    then, 20 years later, the basic configuration did not even
                    come close to IBM's System/360.

                    designed to burn off excess hydrogen, and it also increases

                    two-stage rocket will carry a classified payload for the
                    National Reconnaissance Office as part of the NROL-70

                    The mission was originally scheduled for liftoff on March 28
                    but the launch was scrubbed due to an “issue with the
                    gaseous nitrogen pipeline which provides pneumatic pressure
                    to the launch vehicle systems,” ULA

                    ULA’s Delta IV Heavy rocket is the last of the Delta family
                    of medium-to-heavy launch vehicles. The Delta legacy dates
                    back to the Cold War, with the first Delta rocket launched
                    on May 13, 1960, from SLC-17 at Cape Canaveral as part of a
                    program developed by the U.S. government to build a suite of
                    expendable launch vehicles to carry payloads ranging from
                    satellites to deep space missions. The rocket family has had
                    388 launches spanning across six decades, evolving over time
                    to become bigger and more advanced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After the Delta chapter comes to a close, ULA’s new Vulcan
                    Centaur rocket is designed to take over. The
                    two-stage-to-orbit, expendable, heavy-lift launch vehicle
                    made its debut in January,

                    [...] "Agricultural diversification has been accused of
                    perhaps being good for biodiversity, but having a few
                    negative aspects too—especially with regards to not being
                    able to achieve sufficiently high yields. But what we
                    actually see, is that there is no reduction in yield from
                    diversified agriculture—not even when we include data from
                    large-scale European agriculture," says Grass.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In fact, the figures demonstrate that in the case of small
                    farms and farms with lots of cultivated land in the
                    surroundings, more diversified agriculture can significantly
                    promote food security. This, according to the researchers,
                    could be due to a number of factors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "One example is fruit trees planted in maize fields in
                    Malawi, which can help farming families improve their food
                    security through improved diet and nutrition. Partly because
                    they eat the fruits themselves, and also because the trees
                    generate extra income when their fruits are sold at
                    market—income that provides small-scale farmers with
                    purchasing power for other foods," says Rasmussen.

                    Engineers have determined why NASA's Voyager 1 probe has
                    been transmitting gibberish for nearly five months, raising
                    hopes of recovering humanity's most distant spacecraft.

                    billion km) from Earth,

                    down to ground controllers on November 14. For nearly four
                    months, NASA knew Voyager 1 was still alive—it continued to
                    broadcast a steady signal—but could not decipher anything it
                    was saying.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Confirming their hypothesis, engineers at NASA's Jet
                    Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California confirmed a small
                    portion of corrupted memory caused the problem. The faulty
                    memory bank is located in Voyager 1's Flight Data System
                    (FDS), one of three computers on the spacecraft. The FDS
                    operates alongside a command-and-control central computer
                    and another device overseeing attitude control and pointing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Flight Data Subsystem was an innovation in
                    computing when it was developed five decades ago. It was the
                    first computer on a spacecraft to use volatile memory. Most
                    of NASA's missions operate with redundancy, so each Voyager
                    spacecraft launched with two FDS computers. But the backup
                    FDS on Voyager 1 failed in 1982.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due to the Voyagers' age, engineers had to reference paper
                    documents, memos, and blueprints to help understand the
                    spacecraft's design details. After months of brainstorming
                    and planning, teams at JPL

                    to prompt the spacecraft to send back a readout of the FDS
                    memory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The team suspects that a single chip responsible for
                    storing part of the affected portion of the FDS memory isn’t
                    working,"

                    >
                    posted Thursday. "Engineers can’t determine with certainty
                    what caused the issue. Two possibilities are that the chip
                    could have been hit by an energetic particle from space or
                    that it simply may have worn out after 46 years."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Voyager 1's distance from Earth complicates the
                    troubleshooting effort. The one-way travel time for a radio
                    signal to reach Voyager 1 from Earth is about 22.5 hours,
                    meaning it takes roughly 45 hours for engineers on the
                    ground to learn how the spacecraft responded to their
                    commands.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Although it may take weeks or months, engineers are
                    optimistic they can find a way for the FDS to operate
                    normally without the unusable memory hardware, which would
                    enable Voyager 1 to begin returning science and engineering
                    data again," NASA said.

                    Where is the line between life and death? For centuries, it
                    was pretty clear. You stopped breathing, your heart stopped
                    beating, your brain shut down, it was off to the morgue.
                    Well, now the science is showing that the demarcation line
                    for crossing the River Styx may not be quite so clear cut.

                    tl;dr: Deep technical analysis of the CONTINUATION Flood: a
                    class of vulnerabilities within numerous HTTP/2 protocol
                    implementations. In many cases, it poses a more severe
                    threat compared to the Rapid Reset: a single machine (and in
                    certain instances, a mere single TCP connection or a handful
                    of frames) has the potential to disrupt server availability,
                    with consequences ranging from server crashes to substantial
                    performance degradation. Remarkably, requests that
                    constitute an attack are not visible in HTTP access logs. A
                    simplified security advisory and list of affected projects
                    can be found in: HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood.

                The total eclipse will begin on Monday April 8 in North America
                in about two hours from when this story posts. Millions of
                people live in the path of totality and it will pass over some
                major metropolitan cities. Possible topics could be:<br />+ Were
                you in the path of totality?<br />+ Did you have to travel to
                get there?<br />+ Was it clear (in my area the forecast is for
                "partly sunny"--not too promising).<br />+ Your observations of
                the event itself -- personal, professional, previous solar
                eclipses you have witnessed, etc.

                    AI-powered web app after a local mother reported that the
                    site generated an image with her face on the body of a
                    topless woman.

                    [...] To test the device, Huang and colleagues used it to
                    measure the tiny variations in the force of gravity caused
                    by the apparent motion of the Sun and the Moon, the same
                    variations that cause the tides. After setting up their
                    device in a vacuum chamber, they waited several weeks for
                    conditions inside the device to stabilize before conducting
                    continuous measurements for five days. Their signal
                    displayed a series of oscillations representing variations
                    in the local gravitational acceleration of up to about 10−7
                    of the standard value (g, approximately 10 m/s2). The
                    results show a close correspondence between the predicted
                    gravitational variations and the experimental data. Overall,
                    says Huang, the gravimeter demonstrated a sensitivity
                    roughly 3 times better than small solid-state gravimeters,
                    with much higher stability.

                    even break into the network where the software was developed
                    to corrupt it at the source. Or, in the case of one
                    particularly insidious software supply chain attacker known
                    as Jia Tan, they can spend two years politely and
                    enthusiastically volunteering to help.

                    Over the weekend, the cybersecurity and open source software
                    community was shocked by the news that a relatively new,
                    experimental version of XZ Utils—a compression utility
                    integrated into many popular distributions of
                    Linux—contained a backdoor that would have allowed hackers
                    in possession of a specific private key to connect to the
                    backdoored system and run their own commands as an
                    administrator. Only some chance detective work carried out
                    by a lone Microsoft engineer, Andres Freund—who'd detected a
                    strange delay in how the remote connection protocol SSH was
                    running in a version of the Linux variant Debian—caught the
                    spy trick before it ended up in many millions of systems
                    worldwide.

                    Hail is a semi-frequent visitor to winter, and occasionally
                    summer, seasons across the globe and tends to pass by in a
                    short but sharp downpour that can often be overlooked.
                    However, sometimes these meteorological phenomena are hard
                    to ignore. This was the case on 30 August 2022, when Gerona,
                    north-eastern Spain, experienced a severe event in which
                    individual hailstones reached a massive 12cm—the largest
                    ever documented in the country. This led to serious damage
                    to buildings, cars and agricultural areas, as well as 67
                    injuries and one fatality.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Untangling the cause of this unusually extreme hail event is

                    published in <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i>. Professor
                    Maria Luisa Martin, of Universidad de Valladolid, Spain, and
                    colleagues investigated the role a record-breaking marine
                    heat wave had in exacerbating the hail storm.

                  <p>
                    The Iberian Peninsula experienced a sea surface temperature
                    increase of an average 3.27°C protracted over six weeks in
                    the summer of 2022, the highest on record. The research team
                    found that atmospheric convective energy reached
                    unprecedented levels, thus alongside moisture from a warm
                    ocean, enhanced supercell (storms with vertical rotation of
                    rising air currents) development in the Pyrenees, leading to
                    the meteorological phenomenon of hail.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To explore this further, the scientists used a dataset of
                    &gt;280 documented supercells from 2011 to 2022 (with 57
                    citing large hailstones &gt;5cm diameter, and four giant
                    hailstone events where they exceed 10cm diameter) to
                    simulate the hail event both with and without the influence
                    of a marine heat wave in the Mediterranean Sea. Increased
                    sea surface temperature is known to be one of many
                    consequences of global warming, and it has a direct impact
                    on the frequency and intensity of prolonged (&gt;5 days)
                    heat wave events.

                    [...] This research is important as it is a cautionary tale
                    of how continued climate change will not only increase the
                    likelihood of marine heat waves, but also other elements of
                    Earth's interconnected cycles. Consequently, there may be
                    more unforeseen meteorological events to come, with alarming
                    environmental, social and economic impacts.

                    [...] The macaques that roam Lopburi are a symbol of local
                    culture, and a major tourist draw. But after years of
                    dangerous encounters with residents and visitors and several
                    failed attempts to bring peace with population controls,
                    local people and businesses have had enough.

                    The monkeys frequently try to snatch food from humans,
                    sometimes resulting in tussles that can leave people with
                    scratches and other injuries. But outrage grew in March when
                    a woman dislocated her knee after a monkey pulled her off
                    her feet in an effort to grab food, and another man was
                    knocked off a motorcycle by a hungry monkey.

                    Authorities hope to round up some 2,500 urban monkeys and
                    place them in massive enclosures, said Athapol
                    Charoenshunsa, the director-general of the Department of
                    National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation. They'll
                    work with wildlife experts to find a way for a limited
                    number of monkeys to stay at liberty in the city, he added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Previous control measure have fallen short. From
                    2014-2023, the wildlife authorities neutered about 2,600

                    Athapol said they are also working in other areas of
                    Thailand that are facing problems with monkeys, such as
                    Prajuab Kiri Khan and Phetchaburi. He said 52 of the
                    country's 77 provinces report frequent problems from
                    monkeys.

                    This week, the White House officially tasked NASA with
                    establishing a time standard for the moon, called

                    challenging everyday things become," an unnamed White House

                Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of
                Alberta (U of A) in Canada have examined whether attaching a
                condor-inspired winglet to a wind turbine blade can also reduce
                drag and increase energy production.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Wind turbine blades use aerodynamics to extract the wind's
                    energy, which is converted to electricity. But ensuring that
                    they produce as much energy as possible is necessary if
                    we're to rely on clean, sustainable energy production.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What commonly reduces the efficiency of wind turbines is
                    induced drag, created as a result of lift. As a blade passes
                    through the air, an area of lower air pressure is formed on
                    top of it (the suction side). Higher-pressure air below the
                    blade (the pressure side) seeks equilibrium with the
                    lower-pressure area above, resulting in tip vortices, air
                    that trails off the blade tips in spirals. The vortices
                    deflect airflow downward (downwash), creating induced drag.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While most modern airplanes reduce induced drag by using
                    winglets to minimize the effect of tip vortices, their use
                    in the wind industry is still in its infancy. Studies into
                    wind turbines with winglets have noted a boost in power
                    production but often at the cost of extending the blade tip,
                    making it difficult to ascertain whether the improvement is
                    directly attributable to the winglet or an increase in the
                    blade's wetted area, the area in contact with external
                    airflow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To clarify the issue, the U of A researchers turned to
                    <a href="https://www.biome-renewables.com/"
                      >Biome Renewables</a
                    >, a Canadian industrial design firm that creates clean
                    energy products by
                    <a
                      href="https://newatlas.com/robotics/natural-robotics-contest/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;itm_medium=article-body"
                      >mimicking nature</a
                    >
                    and has designed winglets based on condor wings. Biome
                    developed its bio-inspired winglet for 'Project Condor.'
                    It's 17.6 ft (5.35 m) long and designed to be retrofitted to
                    a wind turbine's blade wingtip after production.[...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found that adding the winglet increased the pressure
                    difference between the suction surface and pressure surface
                    along the blade's span, which in turn increased the
                    turbine's torque (rotational force around an axis) and power
                    production. The average increase in energy production was
                    10%, which the researchers concluded was attributable to the
                    aerodynamic changes caused by the winglet and not just an
                    increase in the blade's swept area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To sum up, the results of the wake study and the power
                    production suggest that this bio-inspired design can
                    increase the power output of the wind turbines," said the
                    researchers.
