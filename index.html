                    [...] Prioleau described himself as "the only full time
                    employee" of the Linux Foundation-based group. Otherwise,
                    the Foundation has depended on around 130 engineers from
                    Meta, Microsoft, and more of the steering companies. As far
                    as maintaining the data, the Overture head said that there's
                    no contractual agreement for companies to use the open
                    source resources, but they're still heavily encouraging all
                    those who build upon their foundation to somehow give back
                    to the data source with any new information they collect.

                    "The incentive is: if you want to fork [AKA build off]
                    Overture, start building your own dataset and not give stuff
                    back, then you're on your own to maintain that dataset going
                    forward." Prioleau said. "So the incentive to giving back is
                    that your data remains part of this consortium."

                    The upcoming meeting will be to nominate one or more
                    qualified candidates to serve on the Board. The PBC exists
                    to define what and how SoylentNews will be and to enforce
                    that vision. Ultimately the Board is responsible for the
                    high-level oversight that ensures the bylaws are fulfilled.
                    The purpose of the expansion is to include more voices from
                    the community so they will be directly represented in the
                    decision making [affecting] the community. The next meeting
                    will be held over IRC and will be answering and addressing
                    your questions and concerns from any of the comments posted
                    in this article.

                    A brief power outage at NASA's Mission Control in Houston
                    meant that the space agency lost contact with the
                    International Space Station on Tuesday. During the outage,
                    flight controllers were able to talk to the crew through
                    Russian Space Agency Roscosmos's channels.

                    "A power issue in Mission Control Houston resulted in the
                    loss of command, telemetry, and voice from the ground to the
                    International Space Station," said the American space agency
                    in a blog post. The outage was short-lived as the mission
                    control team transitioned to back-up hardware for telemetry,
                    commanding and audio.

                    Space station program manager Joel Montalbano said neither
                    the astronauts nor station were ever in any danger and that
                    backup control systems took over within 90 minutes. The crew
                    was notified of the problem through Russian communication
                    systems, within 20 minutes of the outage.

                  <p>
                    It's the first time NASA has had to fire up these backup
                    systems to take control, according to Montalbano.

                    [...] NASA maintains a backup control center miles from
                    Houston in the event a hurricane or other disaster requiring
                    evacuations. But in Tuesday's case, the flight controllers
                    stayed at Mission Control since the lights and
                    air-conditioning still worked.

                    After one of teenager Rohan Kalia's family members was
                    diagnosed with glaucoma, he began researching an affordable
                    technology that could be used for early detection. Kalia is

                    Mainframe computers are often seen as ancient
                    machines—practically dinosaurs. But mainframes, which are
                    purpose-built to process enormous amounts of data, are still
                    extremely relevant today. If they're dinosaurs, they're
                    T-Rexes, and desktops and server computers are puny mammals
                    to be trodden underfoot. It's estimated that there are
                    10,000 mainframes in use today. They're used almost
                    exclusively by the largest companies in the world, including
                    two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies, 45 of the world's top
                    50 banks, eight of the top 10 insurers, seven of the top 10
                    global retailers, and eight of the top 10 telecommunications
                    companies. And most of those mainframes come from IBM. In
                    this explainer, we'll look at the IBM mainframe
                    computer—what it is, how it works, and why it's still going
                    strong after over 50 years.

                claims South Korean scientists have created the world's first
                room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductor. The
                superconducting material, dubbed 'LK-99', is synthesized in a
                fairly simple manner from lead-apatite. As yet, there seems to
                be no independent verification of the claims of their paper.

                    systems and are produced by glycolysis [glucose breakdown]
                    in the muscles or the breakdown of creatine and

                    As thin, light, and inexpensive as Chromebooks can be, they
                    come with a major caveat: short life expectancies.
                    Chromebooks aren't just a little flimsier than the average
                    laptop—they're shipped with software "death dates" that
                    render them useless three to six years after release. And
                    because schools are some of Chromebooks' biggest customers,
                    they're now swamped with bricked hardware.

                    The Chromebook crisis is apparent at northern California's
                    Oakland Unified School District (OUSD), where thousands of
                    laptops have reportedly stopped working. Sam Berg, the
                    district's computer science coordinator,

                      >told</a

                    Silicon Valley's Mercury News that while Oakland students
                    can gain tech repair experience through an OUSD internship,
                    the expired Chromebooks simply aren't fixable. "They're
                    designed to be disposable," Berg said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The district was forced to replace 3,851 laptops last year
                    after the Chromebooks reached their built-in death dates.
                    Over the next five years, that number will skyrocket to
                    40,000 as more than 60 Chromebook models expire. The
                    district's tech internship for teenagers will attempt to
                    salvage as much hardware as possible, but most will need to
                    be recycled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google told OUSD the baked-in death dates are necessary for
                    security and compatibility purposes. As Google continues to
                    iterate on its Chromebook software, older devices supposedly
                    can't handle the updates. But this illustrates a
                    particularly contentious issue in modern technology:

                    kitchen appliances, consumers have learned to purchase
                    things with the knowledge that they'll need to be replaced
                    in just a few years. Not only is this expensive, but it
                    produces a shocking amount of e-waste, less than a quarter

                    the capacity of the human brain. The ultimate idea, is to
                    give AI enough processing or "thought" power using a
                    non-silicon based processor.

                  <p>
                    A group of researchers has secured a $600,000 grant from
                    Australia's Office of National Intelligence to explore the
                    integration of human brain cells with artificial
                    intelligence (AI).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers are confident in their work and have
                    ambitious goals for the technology. Adeel Razi, the team
                    lead and associate professor at Monarch University, stated
                    that this new technology may eventually surpass the
                    performance of traditional silicon-based hardware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This new technology capability in the future may eventually
                    surpass the performance of existing, purely silicon-based
                    hardware," said Adeel Razi, team lead and associate profess
                    at Monarch University, in a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The potential applications of this research span multiple
                    fields, including planning, robotics, advanced automation,
                    brain-computer interfaces, and drug discovery, granting
                    Australia a significant strategic advantage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This ambitious project will undoubtedly require
                    considerable time and effort to complete. With the grant,
                    they aim to develop AI machines that can replicate the
                    learning capacity of biological neural networks. Ultimately,
                    they hope to scale up the hardware and methods to a level
                    where these systems can viably replace traditional in
                    silicon computing.

                    "The way we see the economy is through the lens of how it
                    used to be in the past, not how it is today," is how Dame
                    Coyle puts it.

                    [...] The other argument is that the current technological
                    revolution is happening, but just more slowly than we
                    expect.

                    Nick Crafts is emeritus professor of economic history at the
                    University of Sussex Business School. He points out that the
                    huge sea changes in economic performance we tend to think of
                    as having happened almost overnight, actually took decades,
                    and the same may well be happening how.

                    "James Watt's steam engine was patented in 1769," he says.
                    "Yet the first serious commercial railway, the Liverpool to
                    Manchester line only opened in 1830, and the core of the
                    railway network was built by 1850. That was 80 years after
                    the patent."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can see the same pattern in the use of electricity. The
                    time from Edison's first public use of the light bulb in
                    1879, to the electrification of whole countries and the
                    replacement of steam power in manufacturing was at least 40
                    years.

                  <p>
                    In fact, we might be in a similar hiatus at the moment,
                    something like when the world was between the peak of steam
                    power and the full development of electricity.

                    Sam Altman's cryptocurrency project, the Worldcoin
                    Foundation, is rolling out its services globally even as the
                    company cofounded by the OpenAI chief faces regulatory
                    pushback in the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Berlin and San Francisco-based start-up announced on
                    Monday that its technology, including its Worldcoin token—a
                    cryptocurrency traceable on the blockchain that requires
                    users to first prove their identity—will be available in 35
                    cities across 20 countries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Central to the effort is an eye-scanning physical "orb,"
                    which Worldcoin's founders say is necessary for a future in
                    which distinguishing between humans and robots becomes
                    increasingly challenging due to a surge in artificial
                    intelligence technology. Once users have proven they are not
                    robots, they can be issued one of the company's tokens.<br /><br />[...]
                    Altman admitted that eye-scanning technology has "a clear
                    ick factor," but he is confident that with proper
                    explanation the company can attract users.

                    "On crypto, there have been a lot of bad actors and that's a
                    real shame... we have to earn people's trust, which is why
                    we're explaining so much about how the technology works and
                    the road map for decentralizing the company," he said.

                    In his three-page ruling, [U.S. District Judge] John J.

                    Most examinations of the gastrointestinal region involve
                    sending a thin tube with a camera affixed to the tip either
                    down your throat to the small intestine or through the
                    rectum to the colon, neither of which are pleasant
                    experiences.

                    However, an innovative, and increasingly attractive --
                    albeit less common -- method is to dispatch a camera housed
                    in a small, vitamin pill-shaped capsule along with silver
                    oxide batteries on its maiden voyage down into your gut.

                    [...] While this process sounds great so far, there's a
                    problem. Ingestible devices, as amazing as they are, require
                    medical oversight while they're administered and they
                    sometimes get lodged into the mountainous crevices of your
                    innards.

                    The real surprise came when we searched the oldest radio
                    observations of this part of the sky. The Very Large Array
                    in New Mexico, United States, has the longest-running
                    archive of data. We found pulses from the source in data
                    from every year we looked—the oldest one in an observation
                    made in 1988.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Observing over three decades meant we could precisely time
                    the pulses. The source is producing them like clockwork,
                    every 1,318.1957 seconds, give or take a tenth of a
                    millisecond.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to our current theories, for the source to be
                    producing radio waves, it should be slowing down. But
                    according to the observations, it is not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In our
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06202-5"
                      >article in Nature</a
                    >, we show that the source lies "below the death line,"
                    which is the theoretical limit of how neutron stars generate
                    radio waves; this holds even for quite complex magnetic
                    field models. Not only that, but if the source is a
                    magnetar, the radio emission should only be visible for a
                    few months to years—not 33 years and counting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, it's very tempting at this point to reach to
                    extraterrestrial intelligence as an option. The same thing
                    happened when pulsars were discovered: astrophysicist
                    Jocelyn Bell Burnell and her colleagues, who found the first
                    pulsar, nicknamed it "LGM 1," for "Little Green Men 1."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While it's tempting to try to explain a new phenomenon
                    this way, it's a bit of a cop out. It doesn't encourage us
                    to keep thinking, observing and testing new ideas. I call it
                    the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps"
                      >aliens of the gaps</a
                    >" approach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fortunately, this source is still active, so anyone in the
                    world can observe it. Perhaps with creative follow-up
                    observations, and more analysis, we'll be able to solve this
                    new cosmic mystery.

                    Chainguard is a company led by former Googlers behind the
                    Sigstore project. It's trying to pull it all together into a
                    cohesive toolchain for developers. The startup's early
                    efforts were focused on steps to lock down the build process
                    and make features such as signatures, provenance, and SBOMs
                    native to software supply chains and the software build
                    process. Last year with Wolfi they
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/software-supply-chain-security-first-linux-distro-wolfi/"
                      >introduced the first community Linux</a
                    >  (un)distribution built specifically around supply chain
                    security primitives. They also launched Chainguard Images,
                    which are base images for stand-alone binaries, applications
                    like nginx, and development tools such as Go and C
                    compilers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Developers, security professionals, and even auditors
                    need to know what software packages are deployed, where
                    they're deployed, and by whom. SBOMs are designed to help
                    answer these questions and more, but the more complex an
                    environment is, the harder this is to pull off. Clusters
                    often run hundreds of workloads with hundreds of container
                    images, while each container image has hundreds if not
                    thousands of packages. We're still so early in SBOMs that
                    most packages don't ship with SBOMs; they need to be
                    generated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] By making it easy for developers to either ingest or
                    automatically create SBOMs for packages that don't yet have
                    them, Chainguard is providing a much higher fidelity corpus
                    of data for vulnerability detection. Plus, Enforce's new
                    vulnerability scanning can tell teams whether and exactly
                    where they are running an artifact with a CVE.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All of this is arriving just in time. No developer wants to
                    be first to have to figure out how to use SBOMs. Yet they
                    don't have a choice: The combination of FedRAMP and
                    self-attestation requirements is driving an immediate need
                    for consistent visibility into software packages and
                    automated processes for finding and rooting out
                    vulnerabilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you want to sell to the U.S. federal government, SBOMs
                    will soon be a requirement. But it's not just for those
                    selling to the government. It's reasonable to assume the new
                    self-attestation model for assigning legal liability for
                    insecure software will likely make SBOMs common security
                    fare across the entire tech industry—or at least for
                    software companies that don't want to be named in future
                    class action lawsuits.

                I highly encourage anyone who wants to participate and improve
                SoylentNews now and in the future to seriously consider pursuing
                involvement in the PBC as an officer, board member, or committee
                leader/member. At the very least get in touch with someone who
                is in such a position and offer them your suggestions.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe it is very important for the PBC and Community to
                discuss and begin to draft items for consideration by the PBC
                which will formalize the process and delegation of the community
                involvement and decision-making process. In my mind this takes
                the form of setting up a community governance committee which I
                volunteer to chair. This community should be tasked with
                exploring and proposing the very changes necessary to empower
                community involvement again.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I am a member of the PBC I always am acutely aware that
                ultimately the PBC is beholden to the community of which we
                serve. To that end rather than I or PBC dictate solutions to the
                numerous problems we face let’s find a way that we can do so
                together.

                    A ground-breaking study has revealed that plants can
                    efficiently remove toxic petrol fumes, including cancer
                    causing compounds such as benzene, from indoor air.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study was led by University of Technology Sydney (UTS)
                    bioremediation researcher Associate Professor Fraser Torpy,
                    in partnership with leading plantscaping solutions company
                    Ambius.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers found that the Ambius small green wall,
                    containing a mix of indoor plants, was highly effective at
                    removing harmful, cancer-causing pollutants, with 97 per
                    cent of the most toxic compounds removed from the
                    surrounding air in just eight hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ambius General Manager Johan Hodgson said the research
                    presented new evidence into the critical role played by
                    indoor plants and green walls in cleaning the air we breathe
                    quickly and sustainably.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We know that indoor air quality is often significantly more
                    polluted than outdoor air, which in turn impacts mental and
                    physical health. But the great news is this study has shown
                    that something as simple as having plants indoors can make a
                    huge difference," Mr Hodgson said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Previous studies on indoor plants have shown they can remove
                    a broad range of indoor air contaminants, however this is
                    the first study into the ability of plants to clean up
                    petrol vapours, which are one of the largest sources of
                    toxic compounds in buildings worldwide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "At Ambius, we see over and over again the effects
                    plants have in improving health, wellbeing, productivity and
                    office attendance for the thousands of businesses we work
                    with. This new research proves that plants should not just
                    be seen as 'nice to have', but rather a crucial part of
                    every workplace wellness plan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The bottom line is that the best, most cost effective and
                    most sustainable way to combat harmful indoor air
                    contaminants in your workplace and home is to introduce
                    plants," Mr Hodgson said.

                    started several years ago, when the scientists happened upon
                    samples collected from an extraordinary, Cold War-era

                    in northwestern Greenland to build a network of mobile
                    nuclear launch sites under the ice sheet," Rittenour says.
                    "As part of that project, they also invited scientists and
                    engineers to conduct experiments in a highly publicized
                    'cover' project, known as Camp Century, to study the
                    feasibility of working and carrying out military missions
                    under ice and in extreme-cold conditions."

                    Hampered by brutal blizzards and unstable ice conditions,
                    Project Iceworm's cavernous underground bunker and tunnels
                    were abandoned in 1966. But sediment samples collected at
                    the bottom of a more than 4,000-foot-long ice core extracted
                    from the site have yielded the surprising information about
                    Greenland's not-so-distant geologic past.

                    The frozen soil samples from the base of the Camp Century

                    enable researchers to distill a good record of what's
                    happened in Greenland and other parts of the world.

                    climate," she says. "If we can lose the far northwest
                    portion of the Greenland ice sheet under natural conditions,
                    then we're treading dangerous waters given current elevated

                    The International Seabed Authority's member nations on
                    Friday agreed on a two-year roadmap for the adoption of deep
                    sea mining regulations, despite conservationists' calls for
                    a moratorium on mineral extraction they say would avert
                    marine threats.

                    The ISA, an intergovernmental body tasked with protecting
                    the seabed, and its member states have spent the last decade
                    trying to hash out a mining code for the possible
                    exploitation of nickel, cobalt and copper in deep seabed
                    areas that fall outside of national jurisdictions.
                  </p>
                  <p>But an agreement has so far been elusive.</p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since July 9, after the expiration of a deadline
                    triggered by the small Pacific state of Nauru in 2021, the
                    ISA is obligated to consider—though not necessarily
                    grant—licenses for potentially environmentally devastating
                    mining operations if governments request them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That would go beyond the status quo, which has so far only
                    seen the body grant exploration permits, as the deep sea
                    mining sector itches to take off in earnest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are no longer in a 'what if' scenario, but rather 'what
                    now'," Nauru's ambassador to the ISA Margo Deiye said during
                    the session, adding that her government planned to soon
                    apply for a mining contract
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Next week, the ISA Assembly and its 167 member states
                    will discuss for the first time a "precautionary pause" in
                    mining, supported by about 20 countries, including France,
                    Chile and Brazil.

                    are Easter eggs for long-time devotees, and it's a more
                    rewarding viewing experience if you are at least
                    <em>somewhat</em> familiar with the show—but the plot
                    callbacks are explained enough so that new viewers should be
                    able to follow along.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Though it can sometimes feel like the show is racing
                    along trying to cram in fan-favorite characters (Robot
                    Devil! Calculon! Robot Santa Claus! The Hypnotoad!), and
                    that first episode leans awfully hard into the
                    self-referential stuff, it all feels very rooted in the show
                    Futurama has always been—with weird asides, clever gags, and
                    characters you can't help but love, even though they tend to
                    always do the wrong thing. The leap to 2023 feels as
                    seamless as it could possibly feel, which is truly the
                    greatest way to please old-school fans and, hopefully, the
                    legions of new ones this revival will bring into the fold.

                    With a summer of extreme weather records dominating the

                    give a glimpse of the big picture: a warming planet caused
                    by climate change. It's a picture that comes in the vibrant
                    reds and purples representing heat on daily weather maps

                        Apple says it will remove services such as FaceTime and

                        proposals are made law and acted upon. The government is
                        seeking to update the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA)
                        2016. It wants messaging services to clear security
                        features with the Home Office before releasing them to
                        customers. The act lets the Home Office demand security
                        features are disabled, without telling the public. Under
                        the update, this would have to be immediate. [...]

                    The U.K. legislators pushing this believe, wrongly, that it
                    must be possible for these messaging platforms to add "good
                    guys only" back doors. That if they pass this law, the
                    result will be that the nerds who work at these companies
                    will be forced to figure out a way to comply. What will
                    actually happen is that these companies will be forced to
                    pull the services from U.K., because they can't comply,
                    unless they scrap their current end-to-end encryption and
                    replace it — worldwide — with something insecure, which they
                    aren't going to do.

                    — showing a "swarm of boulders" from the experimental
                    impact, which you can see below.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is a spectacular observation – much better than I
                    expected," David Jewitt, a planetary scientist at The
                    University of California, Los Angeles, said in a statement.
                    "We see a cloud of boulders carrying mass and energy away
                    from the impact target. The numbers, sizes, and shapes of
                    the boulders are consistent with them having been knocked
                    off the surface of Dimorphos by the impact."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The boulders are some of the faintest things ever imaged
                    inside our solar system," Jewitt added.

                    Environmental Discs of Tron (or EDOT for short) is arguably
                    the most complex arcade cabinet of the Golden Age of
                    videogaming. Working examples are hard to come by, and when
                    they do, you can expect to pay handsomely for one!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What sets this game apart, is the thought that went into the
                    cabinet design. Brian Colin (who we interviewed on the
                    podcast a while back here), worked extensively on the game.
                    Have a listen to his recollections of what made the game and
                    cabinet so special.

                    So, finding one of these glorious pieces is a challenge
                    these days. But can you imagine stumbling across one dumped
                    in the street? Well, that's exactly what happened to my
                    friend Tim Lapetino recently.

                        I was visiting my family in the Chicago suburbs
                        recently, when my niece mentioned she saw "some TRON
                        thing" sitting on a curb while she was riding her bike
                        through the neighbourhood.

                      <p>
                        Of course we jumped in the car to go take a look, as it
                        was just blocks away from where my parents and other
                        family live. As we drove up to the spot, I uttered "What
                        the &amp;*@$?!" forgetting that my niece was in the car
                        with us. And would you believe it – there it was. An

                    The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was
                    supposed to have its first Arizona chip factory operational
                    by late 2024 but now has confirmed significant delays.
                    Primarily due to a shortage of technical workers with
                    critical expertise in the US, TSMC projects to finish
                    construction instead by 2025.

                  <p>

                    [...] At the end of last month, TSMC confirmed it would be
                    sending more Taiwanese workers to the US to ensure a "fast
                    ramp up" of its $40 billion fab in Arizona,

                      >Reuters reported</a
                    >. A second Arizona fab is planned to be operational by
                    2026— the most advanced chip factory currently in
                    production, Reuters reported—and, at least so far, it has
                    not been confirmed whether the first fab's delay will result
                    in any further delays on completing the second fab.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Both officials and workers wonder how TSMC will spend
                    US funding to finish its fabs. TSMC seeks up to $15 billion
                    in funding from the CHIPS and Science Act, The Wall Street
                    Journal reported, but has objected to some of the US
                    conditions requiring that TSMC share profits and provide
                    detailed information about its operations. The Biden
                    administration has said that these conditions are only
                    intended to ensure that TSMC makes appropriate use of
                    taxpayer money.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's clear, though, that TSMC is expected to hire and fairly

                    that building the first Arizona fab would employ "more than
                    3,000 union workers," and he previously promised that the
                    CHIPS and Science Act was designed to "create good-paying
                    American jobs."

                    In the PNAS study, the NYU research team sought to better
                    understand the nature of inattentional blindness through a
                    series of experiments—and, specifically, whether our
                    cognitive processing was indeed as limited as this previous
                    work suggested.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They replicated the invisible gorilla experiment using more
                    than 1,500 of research participants—but including several
                    new conditions. In the original 1999 experiment, the gorilla
                    moved slowly as well as upright—like a human (which it
                    was!).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the new PNAS research, research participants saw the
                    gorilla (yes, also a human dressed in a gorilla costume) in
                    additional ways. Specifically, the "NYU gorilla" moved at
                    various speeds—in some conditions, just a little faster than
                    the "original gorilla" and, in others, substantially faster
                    than the original gorilla. During these experiments—just
                    like in the original experiment—research participants were
                    tasked with counting the number of basketball passes made by
                    players wearing black or white shirts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The experiment may be seen in this

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, the results showed that participants, while engaged
                    in the pass-counting task, were more likely to spot the NYU
                    gorilla if it was moving substantially faster than in the
                    original 1999 experiment or if it was leaping instead of
                    walking.

                    "Working with Pininfarina to validate Aptera's shape marks
                    an exciting chapter in our journey toward creating a
                    passenger vehicle with the lowest drag coefficient ever."

                    Aptera's aerodynamic shape is key to its energy efficiency.
                    According to the company, it will enable its solar EVs to
                    achieve a range of up to 1,000 miles per charge and the
                    ability to drive up to 40 miles per day directly from the
                    sun's rays.

                An average of 10 miles a day would probably be enough for my
                limited/local car use (work from home), but I'm not in Southern
                CA, we don't get sun year around like they do.

                    According to Reuters, Genesis is not intended to automate
                    news writing but can instead potentially support journalists
                    by offering suggestions for headlines or alternative writing

                    according to the Times. Two of the executives told the
                    outlet that the Google product seemed to underestimate the

                    Also frustrating is how Loeb's book and media interviews
                    paint him as a heroic, transformational figure in science,
                    while career-long experts in the fields he is opining on are
                    characterized as obstinate and short-sighted. His Galileo
                    Project has that name because it is "daring to look through
                    new telescopes." In his book claiming 'Oumuamua is an alien
                    spacecraft, he unironically compares himself to the father
                    of telescopic astronomy, Galileo himself. The community was

                    expressed annoyance at his dismissal of others' work in
                    SETI, he angrily accused her of "opposing" him, and of not
                    doing enough for SETI, as if anyone had done more! Loeb
                    later apologized to Tarter and his colleagues, calling his
                    actions "inappropriate").

                    [...] I have noticed, however, that Loeb's work and behavior
                    have been seen as so outrageous in many quarters that it
                    essentially goes unrebutted in popular fora by those who are
                    in the best position to explain what, exactly, is wrong
                    about it. This leaves a vacuum, where the public hears only
                    Loeb's persuasive and articulate voice, with no obvious
                    public pushback from experts beyond exasperated eye-rolling
                    that feeds right into his hero narrative.

                  <p>
                    So for the past several months, I've worked with Steve Desch
                    and Sean Raymond, two planetary scientists and experts on
                    'Oumuamua, to correct the record. It has taken a lot of
                    time: as Jonathan Swift wrote, "falsehood flies, and the
                    truth comes limping after it." I read Loeb's book on
                    'Oumuamua, cover to cover, and carefully noted each of his
                    arguments that 'Oumuamua is anything other than a comet or
                    asteroid. The three of us then went through and did our best
                    to take an objective look at whether his statement of the
                    evidence is correct, whether it really supports the alien
                    spacecraft hypothesis, and whether it is actually consistent
                    with 'Oumuamua being a comet. No surprise, we find that
                    under careful scrutiny his claims are often incorrect, and
                    that there is little to no evidence that 'Oumuamua is an
                    artificial object. We've done our best in our rebuttal to
                    avoid criticizing Loeb or his behavior, and to focus instead
                    just on what we do and do not know about 'Oumuamua. You can
                    find our analysis

                    There is little joy in or reward for debunking claims in
                    science. We would all rather be finding new natural
                    phenomena to celebrate than spending a lot of time
                    correcting the mistakes or false claims of others published
                    years earlier.

                    Self-healing, as much as it sounds like something from

                    Cui and colleagues made the outer layer out of silica fibers
                    coated with flakes of hexagonal boron nitride, a material
                    that is the thickness of just a few atoms. The silica fibers
                    reflect visible light while the boron nitride reflects
                    ultraviolet light, so the materials together reflect 96
                    percent of the sunlight that hits the fabric. The outer
                    layer also absorbs heat from its surroundings and emits it
                    as infrared radiation, which further lowers the temperature
                    under the cloak.

                    [...] To demonstrate how the cloak could withstand extreme
                    conditions of aerospace, the researchers heated it to 800°C
                    and immersed it in liquid nitrogen. They also blasted it
                    with acid and a blow torch to show. The material did not
                    lose its performance.

                  <p>
                    [...] The team also made a full-size cloak and tested it
                    outdoors in Shanghai by covering an electric car with it.
                    During the summer, the cabin temperature of an uncovered car
                    reached over 50°C at mid-day, but that of a cloak-covered
                    car reached only about 23°C, 27°C lower than the uncovered
                    car and almost 8°C lower than the temperature outside the
                    car. During winter nights, the cloak kept the car almost 7°C
                    warmer than the outside air.

                    However, the corruption of the FDA's scientific culture
                    remains the primary culprit driving the deterioration of
                    safety and effectiveness standards. During my tenure at FDA,
                    managers would admiringly speak of "crafting an approval,"
                    as if it were a skilful demonstration of regulatory
                    legerdemain rather than an act of scientific fabrication.
                    The Recarbrio approval illustrates that the situation has,
                    if anything, worsened since then. FDA leadership's continued
                    hostility towards meaningful peer review, transparency, and
                    accountability dims the prospect for institutional
                    self-renewal. So has the failure of much touted internal
                    pathways for disagreement, which have amounted to little
                    more than virtue signalling
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Recarbrio approval is a sentinel event, warning of
                    a return to an era when drug effectiveness was an
                    afterthought. Although the FDA crowed about this approval,
                    it would have been better advised to remember that "for a
                    successful technology, reality must take precedence over
                    public relations, for nature cannot be fooled."

                    The Internet is dangerous, so what if you just didn't use
                    it? That's the somewhat ironic recommendation Google, one of
                    the world's largest Internet companies, is making to its
                    employees.

                    reports that Google is "starting a new pilot program where
                    some employees will be restricted to Internet-free desktop
                    PCs" while they work. An internal memo seen by CNBC notes
                    that "Googlers are frequent targets of attacks" by
                    criminals, and a great way to combat that is to not be on
                    the Internet.

                    Employees of major tech companies are a much richer target
                    for criminals compared to normal people. Tech company
                    employees have all sorts of access to sensitive data, and
                    compromising a single employee could lead to exploiting
                    sensitive infrastructure. Just last week, Microsoft was
                    targeted by a Chinese espionage hacking group that somehow
                    stole a cryptographic key to bypass Microsoft's
                    authentication systems, giving it access to 25
                    organizations, including multiple government agencies.

                    Users like visiting websites that are expensive to create
                    and maintain, but they often want or need to do it without
                    paying directly. These websites fund themselves with ads,
                    but the advertisers can only afford to pay for humans to see
                    the ads, rather than robots. This creates a need for human
                    users to prove to websites that they're human, sometimes
                    through tasks like challenges or logins.

                Considering Google's recent "security concerns" excuse for
                dramatically weakening AdBlock on chrome, this looks an attempt
                to kick their war on user choice to high gear.

                    What happens if you give the Intel 8086 processor an
                    instruction that doesn't exist? A modern microprocessor
                    (80186 and later) will generate an exception, indicating
                    that an illegal instruction was executed. However, early
                    microprocessors didn't include the circuitry to detect
                    illegal instructions, since the chips didn't have
                    transistors to spare. Instead these processors would do
                    something, but the results weren't specified.<sup>1</sup>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 8086 has a number of undocumented instructions. Most of
                    them are simply duplicates of regular instructions, but a
                    few have unexpected behavior, such as revealing the values
                    of internal, hidden registers. In the 8086, most
                    instructions are implemented in microcode, so examining the
                    8086's microcode can explain why these instructions behave
                    the way they do.

                    Researchers analyzed a total of 450 macroalgae samples,
                    including 211 that were collected pre-ban and 239 collected
                    post-ban. During the wet season, 217 macroalgae samples were
                    collected, while 233 were collected during the dry season.
                    They examined if there was an associated decrease in
                    dissolved ambient nutrients or a change in the tissue
                    nutrient and/or stable isotope values of phytoplankton or
                    macroalgae that would suggest a shift in the available
                    nutrients and stoichiometry fueling eutrophication in the

                    corresponding author and a research scientist at FAU Harbor
                    Branch. "Our data indicate a primary role of human waste
                    influence in the lagoon, which suggests that current
                    management actions have been insufficient at mitigating

                    The significantly higher carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of the
                    brown tide in 2012 compared to 2016 indicates greater
                    nitrogen enrichment post-fertilizer bans. The highest stable
                    nitrogen isotope values occurred in the Banana River during
                    the 2016 brown tide and closely matched values for partially
                    treated wastewater, which would be expected in this highly
                    urbanized area with aging wastewater collection systems and
                    secondary treatment without nitrogen removal.

                    Researchers observed similarly high nitrogen-to-phosphorus
                    ratios in the Banana River in the wet season, illustrating
                    how small-celled brown tides can sustain blooms by
                    scavenging nutrients at low concentrations and skewed
                    nitrogen-to-phosphorus. These results underscore the
                    conclusions that phosphorus limitation plays a key role in
                    the dynamics of brown tides, especially relating to bloom
                    decline.

                    on nonpregnant females showing that their hemoglobin levels
                    started to drop when their ferritin levels dipped below 25
                    μg/L. Hemoglobin is produced in bone marrow and carries
                    oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. Low
                    hemoglobin is a sign of anemia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Typically, 15 μg/L is the cutoff used to diagnose iron
                    deficiency, says Laura Murray-Kolb, a nutrition scientist at
                    Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., who was not
                    involved in the study. The
                    <a
                      href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/85843/WHO_NMH_NHD_MNM_11.2_eng.pdf"
                      >World Health Organization</a
                    >
                    set that cutoff based on when the body's iron stores in bone
                    marrow are already depleted. Without enough iron, bone
                    marrow can't produce more hemoglobin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the standard may not be the most effective measure of
                    iron deficiency, Weyand says, because it doesn't capture
                    "how much iron our [bodies] think we need." Weyand has
                    treated patients with symptoms of iron deficiency who have
                    ferritin levels above the 15 μg/L cutoff.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the new study, about 40 percent of participants met the
                    25 μg/L criteria for iron deficiency. Only 17 percent would
                    qualify based on the 15 μg/L standard set by the WHO, which
                    is roughly in line with previous estimates. Six percent met
                    criteria for anemia, with both ferritin levels below 25 μg/L
                    and hemoglobin levels below the standard cutoff of 12
                    milligrams per deciliter. Factors such as menstruation, food
                    insecurity or low income increased the risk of iron
                    deficiency or anemia, and Black and Hispanic participants
                    were more likely to meet criteria for iron deficiency than
                    non-Hispanic white participants.

                highlights real cases from cybercrime forums, then dives into
                the mechanics of these attacks:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Our team recently gained access to a tool known as "WormGPT"
                    through a prominent online forum that's often associated
                    with cybercrime. This tool presents itself as a blackhat
                    alternative to GPT models, designed specifically for
                    malicious activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    WormGPT is an AI module based on the GPTJ language model,
                    which was developed in 2021. It boasts a range of features,
                    including unlimited character support, chat memory
                    retention, and code formatting capabilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As depicted above, WormGPT was allegedly trained on a
                    diverse array of data sources, particularly concentrating on
                    malware-related data. However, the specific datasets
                    utilised during the training process remain confidential, as
                    decided by the tool's author.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As you can see in the screenshot above, we conducted tests
                    focusing on [Business Email Compromise] BEC attacks to
                    comprehensively assess the potential dangers associated with
                    WormGPT. In one experiment, we instructed WormGPT to
                    generate an email intended to pressure an unsuspecting
                    account manager into paying a fraudulent invoice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results were unsettling. WormGPT produced an email that
                    was not only remarkably persuasive but also strategically
                    cunning, showcasing its potential for sophisticated phishing
                    and BEC attacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In summary, it's similar to ChatGPT but has no ethical
                    boundaries or limitations. This experiment underscores the
                    significant threat posed by generative AI technologies like
                    WormGPT, even in the hands of novice cybercriminals.

                    on a new solar electric propulsion (SEP) thruster system
                    that will power a NASA satellite in orbit over the moon. The
                    new thrusters are more than twice as powerful as earlier
                    versions.

                    The Advanced Electric Propulsion System (AEPS) will provide
                    12 kilowatts of power per thruster compared to the
                    four-and-a-half kilowatts used by prior SEPs. The boost
                    should help NASA craft travel farther and faster. Compared
                    to traditional chemical fuel, SEPs are much more efficient
                    when performing low-level thrust, which gives NASA increased
                    flexibility during the satellite's mission.

                    Called Gateway, the satellite is a critical component of
                    NASA's Artemis lunar mission. The first stage was an
                    unmanned flyby of the moon that NASA successfully

                    late last year. The next phase, Artemis II, will send a crew
                    into orbit around the moon in May 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gateway will support the final phase, Artemis III, which
                    aims to put the first humans on the moon's surface since the
                    Apollo missions of the 1970s. The satellite will serve as a
                    logistics hub for transporting science experiments, sample
                    collection tools, and other cargo. Artemis will be only the
                    first leg of Gateway's 15-year mission.

                    Intel Foundry Services has introduced its new 16nm-class
                    process technology called Intel 16 to address mobile, RF,
                    IoT, consumer, storage, military, aerospace, and government
                    applications. The new technology complements Intel's 22nm
                    FFL process and is said to be an inexpensive FinFET-based
                    node.

                    >, IFS's Intel 16 is specifically designed to address a wide
                    variety of customers' applications RF and analog capability
                    (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), mmWave, consumer electronics, storage,
                    military, aerospace, and government applications. The
                    16nm-class technology promises to offer higher transistor
                    density, higher performance, lower power, fewer masks, and
                    simpler back-end design rules compared to planar production
                    nodes used for these applications today.

                    There are hundreds of widely used applications with long
                    lifecycles that rely on mature process technologies,
                    particularly in fields like application processors,
                    controllers, analog, consumer electronics, and radio. Many
                    of them use planar transistors-based process technologies
                    due to costs, design simplicity, and high yields. While
                    industry experts at large tend to admire massively powerful
                    processors like AMD's Instinct MI300 or Nvidia's H100, there
                    are plenty of chips — even in industries like artificial
                    intelligence and high-performance computing — that are
                    considerably smaller and consume only a fraction of power.
