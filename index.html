                    In a step toward new types of particle physics experiments,
                    scientists cooled and then accelerated a beam of muons. The
                    subatomic particles, heavy cousins of electrons, could be
                    accelerated and slammed together at future particle
                    colliders in hopes of unlocking physics secrets. But first,
                    scientists have to figure out how to give muons a speed
                    boost.

                  <p>
                    Counterintuitively, that means first slowing muons down.
                    Muons in particle beams initially go every which way. To
                    make a beam suitable for experiments, the particles need to
                    be first slowed and then reaccelerated, all in the same
                    direction. This slowing, or cooling, <a

                  <p>
                    [...] The scientists first sent the muons into an aerogel, a
                    lightweight material that slowed the muons and created
                    muonium, an atomlike combination of a positively charged
                    muon and a negatively charged electron. Next, a laser
                    stripped away the electrons, leaving behind cooled muons
                    that electromagnetic fields then accelerated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Muon colliders could generate higher energy collisions than
                    machines that smash protons, which are themselves made up of
                    smaller particles called quarks. Each proton’s energy is
                    divvied up among its quarks, meaning only part of the energy
                    goes into the collision. Muons have no smaller bits inside.
                    And they’re preferable to electrons, which lose energy as
                    they circle an accelerator. Muons aren’t as affected by that
                    issue thanks to their larger mass.

                    (or seeing which cars had the keys left in them) and went on
                    their way. Note that this Hertz location isn't quite dealing
                    in autonomous rentals yet, so pulling a grab 'n go with the
                    keys was in no way an official option.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When the airport realized what was going on, officials
                    tried to contact Hertz but couldn't reach anyone that was
                    on-duty.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It's not clear if everyone who took a vehicle had to
                    later swap it out or faced some sort of penalty.

                    Just last week, news reports emerged that the same cyber
                    espionage crew had

                    Singapore Telecommunications over the summer as a "test run
                    by China for further hacks against US telecommunications
                    companies."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Once thought dismantled, Volt Typhoon has returned, more
                    sophisticated and determined than ever," declared Ryan
                    Sherstobitoff, SVP of threat research and intelligence at
                    SecurityScorecard. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a Tuesday
                    <a
                      href="https://securityscorecard.com/blog/botnet-is-back-ssc-strike-team-uncovers-a-renewed-cyber-threat/"
                      >report</a
                    >, Sherstobitoff revealed that the security shop's Threat
                    Research, Intelligence, Knowledge, and Engagement (STRIKE)
                    Team had spotted Volt Typhoon exploiting outdated Cisco
                    RV320/325 routers and Netgear ProSafe routers. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These end-of-life devices become perfect entry points, and
                    in just 37 days, Volt Typhoon compromised 30 percent of
                    visible Cisco RV320/325 routers," Sherstobitoff wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When asked about specific vulnerabilities being abused,
                    Sherstobitoff told <em>The Register</em>: "There are no
                    clear CVEs that Volt is exploiting in current Cisco
                    devices."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, he added, because the routers are end-of-life, the
                    vendor no longer issues security updates. "This leads to
                    increased exploitation of existing ones," Sherstobitoff
                    warned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since the disruption and subsequent rebuilding of the
                    botnet, the threat hunters have seen "a few dozen"
                    compromised devices, he told us. However, he noted, "we have
                    observed changes in command and control servers being
                    deployed into other network providers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The FBI declined to comment on Volt Typhoon's reported
                    resurgence, and the US government's Cybersecurity and
                    Infrastructure Agency did not immediately response to<i
                      >The Register</i
                    >'s inquiries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Chinese crew's botnet first came to light in 2023, after
                    Microsoft and intelligence agencies from the Five Eyes
                    nations
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/25/china_volt_typhoon_attacks/"

                    >
                    that Volt Typhoon had accessed networks belonging to US
                    critical infrastructure organizations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spy gang, we're told, had built a botnet from Cisco and
                    Netgear routers identified by a self-signed SSL certificate
                    named JDYFJ. This botnet, according to SecurityScorecard,
                    used command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in the
                    Netherlands, Latvia, and Germany to disguise its malicious
                    traffic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By October 2023, Volt Typhoon had taken up occupancy,
                    rent-free, on a compromised VPN device in New Caledonia.
                    This created "a covert bridge between Asia-Pacific and the
                    Americas" that kept "their network alive, hidden from
                    standard detection," Sherstobitoff wrote. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In January 2024, the FBI-led effort disrupted some of Volt
                    Typhoon's infrastructure. However, in the Tuesday report,
                    Sherstobitoff explains the Chinese spies rapidly set up new
                    C2 servers on Digital Ocean, Quadranet, and Vultr and also
                    registered fresh SSL certificates to avoid the prying eyes
                    of law enforcement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As of September, "the botnet persists," he wrote. It uses
                    the JDYFJ cluster to route traffic globally. "Connections
                    from New Caledonia and router nodes remain active for over a
                    month, reinforcing Volt Typhoon's infrastructure."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This report comes as government officials and private
                    security firms alike have noted an uptick in Chinese cyber
                    spy activity on US and global networks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last week, Bloomberg said Volt Typhoon had broken into
                    Singtel's networks before being spotted in June, and had
                    used a web shell in that security breach.

                    We're currently testing a new open-source tool for Manjaro,
                    that will help us with the development of Manjaro. It's
                    called MDD 26 and it collects some anonymous and impersonal
                    statistics about Manjaro systems.

                Manjaro dismisses this claim without actually considering EU

                So, Soylentils, what is your view on this subject? Do you think
                system metrics are required for anyone producing a distro, even
                it the information is as anonymized as they claim it is? Or is
                this overstepping the mark?

                    Apple has rejected the suggestion its practices are
                    anti-competitive, saying users are not required to use
                    iCloud. It said many customers rely on third-party
                    alternatives, and insists it "works hard to make data
                    transfer as easy as possible".

                    sufficient constraint", Toby Starr from legal firm Humphries
                    Kerstetter told the BBC.

                    The Guardian has announced it will no longer post content on
                    Elon Musk's social media platform, X, from its official
                    accounts.

                  <p>
                    In an announcement to readers, the news organisation said it
                    considered the benefits of being on the platform formerly
                    called Twitter were now outweighed by the negatives, citing
                    the "often disturbing content" found on it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We wanted to let readers know that we will no longer post
                    on any official Guardian editorial accounts on the social
                    media site X," the Guardian said.<br />...<br />Responding
                    to the announcement, Musk posted on X that the Guardian was
                    "irrelevant" and a "laboriously vile propaganda machine".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last year National Public Radio (NPR), the non-profit US
                    media organisation, stopped posting on X after the social
                    media platform labelled it as "state-affiliated media". PBS,
                    a US public TV broadcaster, suspended its posts for the same
                    reason.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This month the Berlin film festival said it was quitting X,
                    without citing an official reason, and last month the North
                    Wales police force said it had stopped using X because it
                    was "no longer consistent with our values".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In August the Royal National orthopaedic hospital said it
                    was leaving X, citing an "increased volume of hate speech
                    and abusive commentary" on the platform.

                    Elkies, a prominent number theorist, didn't intend to break
                    rank records. In the mid-2000s, he was studying seemingly
                    unrelated objects called K3 surfaces. To understand them, he
                    sliced them up and looked at the pieces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Imagine starting with a simple surface, a flat plane. You
                    can slice it into infinitely many straight lines, laid side
                    by side. Depending on how you make your slices, the lines
                    you end up with will be defined by different equations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similarly, there are more complicated, curvy surfaces that,
                    when sliced up, yield infinitely many elliptic curves.
                    Mathematicians have been using these surfaces to find
                    higher-rank elliptic curves since the 1950s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Elkies realized that his K3 surfaces were strange enough to
                    give him access to even more exotic curves. In 2006, he
                    sliced a particular K3 surface in just the right way and
                    found among the slices an elliptic curve that he could show
                    had a rank of at least 28 — beating the previous record of
                    24. It was an exciting moment for elliptic curve experts,
                    who believed an explosion of record breakers might follow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead, nothing happened. Elkies' record stood for nearly
                    two decades — a noticeable departure from the relatively
                    steady record-setting rate that mathematicians had enjoyed
                    since the 1970s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Was it perhaps a sign that rank could be limited after all —
                    that the hunters were beginning to close in on their last
                    few prey? Or was it just a reflection of the difficulty of
                    the task?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Elkies announced his discovery in 2006, Zev Klagsbrun
                    was an undergraduate student at Queens College in New York.
                    One of his professors, who had competed against Elkies in a
                    high school math competition in the 1980s — Elkies won —
                    told him about the new record-breaking curve during office
                    hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Klagsbrun was intrigued. Years later, he returned to the
                    result, proving that so long as a widely believed conjecture
                    is true, Elkies' curve has a rank of precisely 28. So when
                    he ran into Elkies at a conference in 2019, he saw an
                    opportunity to push the result even further. Though a bit
                    intimidated — "It's difficult to keep up with him,"
                    Klagsbrun said — he convinced Elkies to return to the search
                    for new curves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I was like, 'Hey, I've got access to some computing power.
                    I'm willing to write fast code. Search with me! Show me your
                    secrets!'" Klagsbrun said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They went back to Elkies' K3 surface. Eighteen years
                    earlier, he had sliced it up in a way that gave him a pile
                    of infinitely many curves. These curves were already quite
                    exotic, but he could only guarantee that they had a rank of
                    at least 17. He still needed an outlier to break the record
                    of 24. Since he couldn't just calculate the rank of every
                    curve in his pile, he used a well-known computational method
                    to determine which among millions of them seemed most likely
                    to have an anomalously high rank. He then calculated those
                    ranks by hand, one by one, until he found his rank 28
                    winner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Klagsbrun could now offer a faster computational method for
                    sifting through the contenders. While Elkies had only been
                    able to look through millions of curves, Klagsbrun could
                    handle tens of trillions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This wider search unearthed many curves in Elkies' old pile
                    that exhibited some unusual properties, but none of them
                    broke his 2006 record. The pair decided to move on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Four years passed. Then, a few months ago, Elkies and
                    Klagsbrun crossed paths once more at a conference and got to
                    talking.
                  </p>

                    They set out to slice the K3 surface in a different way,
                    getting a new pile of curves to work with. But there were
                    hundreds of ways they could slice it, and most of those
                    slicing methods seemed unlikely to produce the curve they
                    sought.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, entirely by accident, they found a slicing method
                    that, like Elkies' previous one, gave them a pile of curves,
                    all guaranteed to have a rank of at least 17. It seemed more
                    likely than the other approaches to contain a hidden gem.
                    Sure enough, using Klagsbrun's more powerful computational
                    technique, they found within that pile an elliptic curve
                    with a rank of at least 29. This elliptic curve has the most
                    complicated set of rational solutions ever seen:
                    Mathematicians need at least 29 independent points to
                    characterize them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The curve's equation, when written as <em>y</em
                    ><sup>2</sup> = <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> + <em>Ax</em> +
                    <em>B</em>, has values of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> that are
                    each over 60 digits long. The 29 independent rational
                    solutions that Elkies and Klagsbrun pinpointed involve
                    numbers that are similarly huge.

                  <p>
                    British telecom giant O2 announced what could be the first
                    deployment of conversational AI specifically designed to
                    counter telephone fraud in the UK telecommunications
                    sector.<br />
                    <br />
                    The hero: a clueless grandma who endlessly and frustratingly
                    digresses while idiot scammers attempt to hoodwink her out
                    of money.<br />
                    <br />
                    The system, dubbed "Daisy," uses AI models to snare
                    fraudsters in meandering conversations lasting up to 40
                    minutes, potentially preventing millions in losses across
                    the network's 24 million mobile customers. The tool operates
                    autonomously around the clock, requiring no human
                    intervention to maintain conversations with suspected
                    scammers.<br />
                    <br />
                    <i
                      >"Stop calling me dear, you stupid [expletive
                      deleted]!"</i
                    >
                    one exasperated tele-scammer shouted in a video O2 aired to
                    show off its new tool.<br />

                    <i>"Got it, dear!"</i> the kindly AI grandma replied.<br />
                    <br />
                    Here's how it works. When a user receives a scam call, they
                    forward the call to the number 7726, which had been used as
                    a hotline to report fraud. From there, Daisy employs a
                    custom large language model with a "personality layer" that
                    generates real-time responses to the scammers.<br />
                    <br />
                    The system transcribes incoming voice to text, processes it
                    through the AI model so responses are context-relevant, and
                    converts the text output back to speech, creating
                    natural-sounding conversations that can include fictional
                    personal details and bank information.<br />
                    <br />
                    It's designed to exploit fraudsters' targeting of elderly
                    victims by presenting as a chatty grandmother, complete with
                    meandering stories about family and knitting.

                    Digital software locks have just become flimsier in Canada
                    with the passage of a pair of laws allowing for their bypass

                    Royal assent was granted to two right to repair bills last
                    week that amend Canada's Copyright Act to allow the
                    circumvention of technological protection measures (TPMs) if
                    this is done for the purposes of "maintaining or

                  <p>
                    The pair of bills allow device owners to not only repair
                    their own stuff regardless of how a program is written to
                    prevent such non-OEM measures, but said owners can also make
                    their devices work with third-party components without
                    needing to go through the manufacturer to do so.

                    [...] TPMs can take a number of forms, from simple
                    administrative passwords to encryption, registration keys,
                    or even the need for a physical object like a USB dongle to
                    unlock access to copyrighted components of a device's
                    software. Most commercially manufactured devices with
                    proprietary embedded software include some form of TPM, and
                    neither C-244 nor C-294 place any restrictions on the use of
                    such measures by manufacturers.

                    out, neither Copyright Act amendments do anything to expand
                    access to the tools needed to circumvent TPMs. That puts
                    Canadians in a similar position to US repair advocates, who
                    in 2021 saw the US Copyright Office loosen DMCA restrictions
                    to allow limited repairs of some devices despite TPMs, but

                    [...] "While it's now legal to circumvent the digital locks
                    on these machines, the ruling does not allow us to share or
                    distribute the tools necessary to do so," iFixit director of
                    sustainability Elizabeth Chamberlain said last month. "The
                    ruling doesn't change the underlying statute making it
                    illegal to share or sell tools that bypass software locks.
                    This leaves most of the repair work inaccessible to the
                    average person, since the technical barriers remain high."

                    Pizza Hut has melded the disparate worlds of bready, cheesy
                    foodstuffs and console gaming with the new PIZZAWRMR. This
                    innovation is designed to sit atop your Sony PlayStation 5
                    console and keep your takeaway of choice piping hot while
                    you enjoy your heated gaming session. This isn't a new
                    retail product or a giveaway, though. Pizza Hut Canada has
                    made the 3D printing source files free for anyone who signs
                    up to download, modify, and print.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The PIZZAWRMR design is inspired by the pizza-centric
                    restaurant's red roof. The lid opens laptop-style for
                    convenient pizza slice access. According to Pizza Hut,
                    several slices of pizza can fit into the top box. Diagrams
                    show that the hot exhaust from the console is channeled
                    under and into the pizza area, which is the appliance of

                It's that time of the year again. A compilation of the most
                common passwords. Nothing has changed. No lessons have been
                learned. Either people don't care or they, still, just doesn't
                know any better.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is the common list but it can also be shown on a per
                country level. It doesn't really make it better. Idiocy is
                evenly spread across the lands.

                    It's our sixth year—this time, in collaboration with
                    NordStellar—analyzing people's password habits, and guess
                    what? They're still really bad.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And we're not just talking about personal passwords here.
                    This time, we also put together a list of the most common
                    corporate passwords to see how they compare to those used in
                    everyday life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, check out all the dishonorable winners on both lists and
                    learn what the latest trends are.

                    waste and fraud which exists throughout our annual $6.5
                    Trillion Dollars of Government Spending." Trump said DOGE

                    no later than July 4, 2026" because "a smaller Government,

                After almost 2 years and a lot of hard work by many people, we
                have finally achieved what we set out to do. On Wednesday, the
                Linode servers were decommissioned, and the site is now
                completely independent and running on its own hardware. All the
                site data and the domains belong to the community - yes, you own
                this site.
              </p>
              <p>
                It could not have been possible without the dedication of quite
                a few people - some of whom have not made it to today. It wasn't
                pleasant and it wasn't easy. There were numerous meetings to
                create a new set of Bylaws. That in itself took many months of
                often acrimonious debate. Everyone wanted the same end, but they
                were not happy with how it was being achieved. In the end, as is
                always the case, it required a lot of compromise, and it meant
                we needed to say goodbye to the old way of doing things. So to
                all of those who participated in those meetings: mechanicjay,
                AudioGuy, Deucalion, Fnord666, MartyB, Separatrix, cmn32480,
                kolie, hubie, mrpg, requerdanos, fab23, chromas, fliptop,
                dx3bydt3, tedious, cosurgi, Runaway1956, and even aristarchus,
                and many that I have probably missed out, a huge thank you from
                me. And if I have missed you out then that is entirely my fault
                and I apologise!
              </p>
              <p>
                The Bylaws dictate how the business will be managed. They do not
                contain any rules about how the site will be used, or what is
                permitted in submissions or discussions and what is not, or any
                of those things that tend to interest the community. But there
                are some unique differences in our Bylaws from those previously.
                The Board (which I will get to in a moment) manage this site on
                your behalf. While they handle routine matters as appropriate to
                their post, many actions require them to seek the agreement of
                the community. You will have a say in major decisions. After
                all, you own the site. The data cannot be used for any purpose
                other than maintaining this site without a majority decision of
                the community.
              </p>
              <p>
                So having created the Bylaws, we could apply to create a
                company. This was necessary so that the new company (Soylent
                Phoenix) could receive whatever assets the original company
                (SoylentNews PBC) was prepared to transfer. For legal reasons,
                the Board members cannot be anonymous; they have to sign various
                pieces of legal documentation to create the company. So I asked
                for volunteers from the community. More than we needed stepped
                forward and so the business was created. The Chairman of the
                Board is OregonJohn (6105), the Treasurer is Dale (539) (and he
                is actually a qualified accountant!), and the Secretary is
                holeinone (17639). They have also been working hard on your
                behalf setting up the company, creating Stripe accounts,
                managing the current funds, and filling in the paperwork that is
                associated with a business. Technically the Board is a temporary
                one because they do not yet have the approval of the community.
                But that is built into the Bylaws, and it allows us to keep
                moving forward until their posts are confirmed by the community,
                or challenged by someone else who believes they should be
                allowed to do the job.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next came the transfer of assets. Like all things this did not
                go as smoothly as everyone had hoped it would. Quite
                understandably, it was necessary for everything to be
                accountable and legal, and to look after everyone's interests.
                Again, it was only by having some tough discussions and making
                compromises on both sides that anything has actually been
                achieved. So another thank-you to NCommander and Matt Angel. I
                think we have a solution which, while not meeting all of our
                initial dreams, is one that we can live with for the future. The
                site never squandered money and there is nothing to suggest that
                your donations have been misused.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will probably now all be aware that two people have donated
                hardware and a data connection at no cost to the site. Those
                people are kolie and fliptop, and they have my sincere thanks.
                Kolie's server is the one that you are using at the moment to
                read this Meta. In fact, it is handling all of the site
                including email, IRC, DNS, Varnish, the database, etc. etc.
                Fliptop's server is currently an off-site backup for our data
                but will probably require a bit of expansion before it will cope
                with the full Docker installation. You will also be aware that,
                over the recent weeks and months, kolie has built the entire
                software infrastructure into Docker containers, moving each
                function one by one from the Linode servers and incrementally
                adding it to our own hardware. He has put many man hours into
                this task and I for one have enjoyed working with him - although
                my contribution has been considerably less than his! Again, I
                offer my grateful thanks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, none of this would have been possible without the
                community being tolerant and understanding as we have
                encountered each unexpected obstacle. The community has, in
                fact, grown slightly in the last 2 years, but it remains at
                roughly 10% of what it once was. I thank you all for making this
                possible. Welcome to <b>your</b> site.
              </p>
              <p>And now for something completely different....</p>
              <h2>Community Representatives</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                To provide the community with more visibility regarding the
                actions of staff and the reason and justification for those
                actions, we have created 3 posts which will act as Community
                Representatives. Their prime role is to provide the community
                with the assurance that management is behaving responsibly and
                within the rules governing the site, and for the community to
                have a focus when they have concerns regarding what is going on
                behind the 'curtains'. They will act as your voice in
                discussions and decisions. They will have full access to staff
                discussions but will only have limited access, and then only
                when absolutely necessary, to the data stored in the database.
                We have had 3 volunteers for these posts for many months, but I
                will provide more details once I have confirmed that they are
                still volunteering for the role, and when we have hammered out
                the working procedures that must be adopted for this system to
                function correctly.

              <p>
                We now have TOR up and running again - we had it quite a few
                years ago and then it disappeared. Eventually, the link will be
                in the SoylentNews side panel on your screen, but for now it is
                cut and paste:

              <p></p>
              <p>
                As I mentioned earlier, technically the current board is
                temporary. If you wish to stand for a post then you may do so.
                We will be asking for nominations in the near future. However,
                remember that you cannot remain anonymous as your name has to be
                recorded on the official business records.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will provide you with a Meta page should you wish to explain
                to the community why you believe that they should vote for you.
                The method of voting will be 1 vote per active account, which
                must be in good standing (i.e. meet a minimum karma level and
                not be currently banned). The software that will be used is
                still under consideration as the original voting software was
                written and operated by audioguy who is not currently taking an
                active part in the site management.
              </p>
              <p>
                You cannot nominate someone else for a post. They have to put
                themselves forward as a candidate. You can of course vote for
                them should they do so.

              <h2>realDonaldTrump Account</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                Accounts that have been dormant for over 5 years quickly attract
                attention when they suddenly re-appear. In recent years we have
                seen attempts to resurrect old accounts, sometimes by people
                other than the original owner. There is an option built in to
                Rehash which is named "Force User to Verify Account" (FUVA) and
                it appears on the user's administration page. It simply resets
                the password and sends the new password to the email address
                that we hold for that account in the database. The account
                holder can then reset the password to something of their own
                choosing and everything works as it should. Currently, it is
                invoked automatically after the 5-year point if the account
                becomes active again. About a week ago the "realDonaldTrump"
                (rDT) account suddenly sprang back into life, having been
                dormant since 2019, and for the most part it was welcomed by the
                community. However, by making a comment the FUVA triggered.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think that the account holder has either forgotten how to
                access his email or the email address has lapsed for some other
                reason. So the account is now stuck in limbo. Without a working
                email contact we cannot send the new password to the account
                holder. I do NOT want to know who the account owner is. However,
                they must provide a working email address, which can be a
                temporary or throw-away address, and they must provide
                sufficient detail about the account to prove that they are the
                true account owners. The site can be reactivated as a parody
                account which will have specific restrictions associated with
                it.
              </p>
              <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                Although the site is now independent and 'under new management'
                there is still much that remains to be done.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  For the present the rules that we have inherited will remain
                  in force, but they will have to be rewritten and approved by
                  the community to take us into the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We will need people to assist with the sys-admin role - which
                  is more Docker management than anything else. Interested
                  people do not have to currently know or use Docker, I am sure
                  that we can provide guidance on acquiring those skills and
                  then explaining the current site structure. It is
                  <b>much</b> simpler than it once was.

                <li>
                  We are investigating how to create a separate environment for
                  both testing code before it is integrated into the main site
                  and as a training facility.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As ever, we need your support by providing submissions and by
                  participating in the discussions. There are 23 submissions in
                  the queue but 17 of them by one of our 2 submission bots which
                  many people dislike.

              <h2>Potential Return of Anonymous Cowards to the Full Site</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                Over the last week or two the level of spamming and abuse has
                significantly reduced. However, the reasons for this are
                unclear, and it might not indicate a permanent or even
                long-lasting change. If the low level continues for a
                significant period (certainly into the New Year) then it might
                be possible to re-admit ACs to the whole site again. This is
                something that is we all want to see, and it would be a welcome
                enhancement to the site. However, it depends entirely on those
                few individuals who account for the vast majority of the spam
                and abuse.
              </p>
              <p>
                If ACs are allowed back onto the full site then any permanent
                return is entirely dependent on the spamming remaining at a very
                low level, and for personal attacks to be rare events.

                    Bluesky is a decentralized microblogging social networking
                    service primarily operated by Bluesky Social, PBC. It was
                    created as a proof of concept for the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol"
                      >AT Protocol</a
                    >, a communication protocol for decentralized social
                    networks. The platform is analogous to Twitter, where users
                    can share short text posts, images, and video, and can like,
                    repost, or reply to any given post. Bluesky Social claims
                    the social app was "designed to not be controlled by a
                    single company" through the use of the AT Protocol as its
                    foundation. Bluesky Social promotes a composable user
                    experience and algorithmic choice as core features of
                    Bluesky, offering a "marketplace of algorithms" where users
                    can choose or create feeds to customize their experience.
                    Bluesky offers a DNS-based domain name handle system through
                    the AT Protocol, allowing users to verify an account's
                    legitimacy and identity after signing up by proving
                    ownership of a domain name without involving Bluesky Social
                    in the verification process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bluesky was originally created as a research initiative in
                    2019 by then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to investigate the
                    possibility of decentralizing the platform. This initiative
                    resulted in the hiring of Jay Graber in August 2021 to lead
                    the Bluesky project and what is now the AT Protocol, with
                    initial funding provided by Twitter. After the acquisition
                    of Twitter by Elon Musk, Twitter severed all legal and
                    financial ties with Bluesky Social. This led to the rapid
                    development of the Bluesky social app and the AT Protocol as
                    a minimum viable product, initially launching as an
                    invite-only beta. The social app opened registrations to the
                    general public in February 2024. Bluesky is considered a
                    major competitor to Twitter following the acquisition of the
                    platform by Elon Musk, alongside Threads and Mastodon

                    If you came of age in the 1960s or 1970s and then later
                    became an EE, chances are you're more than casually
                    acquainted with Heathkit. Many engineers started their
                    budding careers by building one or more kits made by the
                    Heath Company. I certainly did. When I stumbled across a
                    brief interview with Chas Gilmore, who joined the Heath
                    Company in 1966 as a design engineer and worked at the Heath
                    Company on and off for more than two decades, eventually
                    becoming VP of product development, marketing, and sales, I
                    knew I needed to interview him.

                  <p>
                    Launched earlier this year, the trial tests ways of
                    automatically detecting age. The trial includes evaluating
                    methods like biometric facial analysis, voice analysis, and
                    behavioral data to estimate user age without relying solely
                    on traditional identification.

                    The 12-month lead time is designed to make sure
                    implementation is done in a "practical way," said Rowland.

                    "But let's be clear too, these platforms know their users
                    better than anyone," added Rowland. "These platforms
                    understand their habits, their capabilities, what sort of
                    content should be driven to them, and what their behaviors
                    are."

                    Roman Sterlingov, 36, a Russian-Swedish national, was also
                    ordered to repay more than half a billion dollars accrued
                    from the cryptocurrency mixing service that he ran for a
                    decade between 2011 and 2021.

                    Bitcoin Fog was assessed to have processed 1.2 million
                    Bitcoin during that time, worth roughly $400 million at the
                    time it was shuttered. Of this, Sterlingov was ordered to

                    back in March, at which point he faced a maximum 50-year
                    sentence. Prosecutors said the vast majority of Sterlingov's
                    wealth came from the proceeds of crime in which he and his
                    online service helped criminals hide from law enforcement.

                  <p>
                    The court heard that the crimes associated with this
                    activity included the sale of drugs, computer misuse
                    offenses, identity theft, and child sexual abuse material

                    service that was open for business to criminals looking to
                    hide dirty money," said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney

                    significant dent in their use. However, investigators will
                    be pleased that a service as relied upon as Sterlingov's
                    could be scuppered and distrust sown throughout the
                    community of criminals who use them.

                    Massachusetts has passed a statewide ballot initiative that
                    gives rideshare drivers the opportunity to unionize while
                    remaining independent contractors. The initiative was
                    brought forward by the Service Employees International Union
                    and the International Association of Machinists and
                    Aerospace Workers. It passed with a narrow margin of about
                    54 percent of the vote.

                    will allow the state's 70,000 rideshare drivers to form
                    unions and leverage collective bargaining power, which is
                    not permitted for independent contractors under the National
                    Labor Relations Act. These workers can unionize if they
                    receive signatures from at least 25 percent of active
                    drivers in Massachusetts. The initiative also creates a
                    hearing process so that drivers for companies such as Lyft
                    and Uber can bring complaints about unfair work practices to
                    a state board. However, the ballot initiative does not
                    contain language about strike protections. It also does not
                    extend to food delivery drivers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Uber and Lyft did not actively campaign against the
                    Massachusetts measure, but they have raised concerns about
                    the specific language. Some labor advocates also opposed the
                    initiative, cautioning that it could hamper efforts for
                    rideshare drivers to win recognition as full-time employees.
                    "We're not against unionization," Kelly Cobb-Lemire, an
                    organizer with Massachusetts Drivers United, told
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/technology/uber-lyft-drivers-unionize-massachusetts.html"
                      ><em>The New York Times</em></a

                  <p>
                    Independent contractors often are not protected by federal
                    or state labor laws because they aren't full-time employees.
                    The Massachusetts ballot measure could create a precedent
                    for other states to offer unionization options for gig
                    workers. California has been a battleground for labor
                    protections for gig workers who drive for Uber and Lyft for
                    several years. Most recently, a court

                    But while tunneling transistors can enable sharp switching
                    slopes, they typically operate with low current, which
                    hampers the performance of an electronic device. Higher
                    current is necessary to create powerful transistor switches
                    for demanding applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using tools at MIT.nano, MIT’s state-of-the-art facility for
                    nanoscale research, the engineers were able to carefully
                    control the 3D geometry of their transistors, creating
                    vertical nanowire heterostructures with a diameter of only 6
                    nanometers. They believe these are the smallest 3D
                    transistors reported to date.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such precise engineering enabled them to achieve a sharp
                    switching slope and high current simultaneously. This is
                    possible because of a phenomenon called quantum confinement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Quantum confinement occurs when an electron is confined to a
                    space that is so small that it can’t move around. When this
                    happens, the effective mass of the electron and the
                    properties of the material change, enabling stronger
                    tunneling of the electron through a barrier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because the transistors are so small, the researchers can
                    engineer a very strong quantum confinement effect while also
                    fabricating an extremely thin barrier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “We have a lot of flexibility to design these material
                    heterostructures so we can achieve a very thin tunneling
                    barrier, which enables us to get very high current,” Shao
                    says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers are now striving to enhance their
                    fabrication methods to make transistors more uniform across
                    an entire chip. With such small devices, even a 1-nanometer
                    variance can change the behavior of the electrons and affect
                    device operation. They are also exploring vertical
                    fin-shaped structures, in addition to vertical nanowire
                    transistors, which could potentially improve the uniformity
                    of devices on a chip.

                    passed by, its instruments detected strong radiation around
                    Uranus, yet, curiously, didn't find any source of energized
                    particles to feed these zones of radiation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For decades, the observation has been an enigma. But not
                    anymore. Recent analysis of Voyager's old data found that
                    extreme solar wind — a flow of particles shooting out from
                    the

                    — impacted the environs around Uranus and created the
                    abnormal episode.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The spacecraft saw Uranus in conditions that only occur
                    about 4 percent of the time," Jamie Jasinski, a NASA
                    physicist who led the new research published in
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02389-3"
                      ><em>Nature Astronomy</em></a
                    >, said in a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When the solar wind hit Uranus' magnetosphere, it
                    compressed the distant planet's magnetosphere, and squeezed
                    out the plasma (hot gas composed of electrically charged
                    particles) that naturally surrounds Uranus. Instead, the
                    solar wind injected its own particles into radiation belts
                    around Uranus. This explains why the Uranus environment was
                    so irradiated — but didn't seem to have an obvious source of
                    radiation.

                  <p>
                    These results also suggest that some of Uranus' five moons
                    aren't dead, after all. The lack of plasma around the planet
                    hinted that the moons weren't geologically active, because

                    A judge based in Oakland, California has ruled that Meta CEO
                    Mark Zuckerberg cannot be held personally liable in 25
                    separate lawsuits alleging harm caused by social media.

                  <p>
                    On 7 November, US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers
                    rejected accusations that Zuckerberg acted to conceal from
                    child users the mental health risks of using Facebook and
                    Instagram, which both come under the parent organisation
                    Meta.

                  <p>
                    The plaintiffs in the case claimed that Zuckerberg ignored a
                    number of repeated internal warnings about the mental health
                    risks posed by his platforms to young users and that he
                    publicly downplayed them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The plaintiffs brought claims under the laws of 13
                    states: Wisconsin, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia,
                    Connecticut, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania,

                  <p>
                    Explaining her decision, Gonzalez Rogers said that control
                    of corporate activity alone is not enough to establish
                    liability on the part of Zuckerberg.

                    print commands. The printer, a modified

                    printing dimensions of 180 by 180 by 65 millimeters. The
                    robot has printed pet food bowls, signage, and accessibility
                    markers as sample objects.

                    [...] We had to step back and build this entirely different
                    thing, using the environment as a design element. We asked:
                    how do you integrate the real world environment into the
                    design process, and then what kind of things can you print
                    out in the world? That's how this printer was born.

                previously been disclosed to them) vulnerability will be made
                public, notify the world that the affected devices are

                    is the company behind Gorilla Glass, a break-resistant glass
                    used to protect screens that’s used on essentially all of
                    the most popular smartphones. Today, the European Commission
                    <a

                    >
                    Corning for anti-competitive practices, alleging that the
                    glassmaker is preventing competition through exclusive
                    supply agreements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the press release, Corning requires mobile
                    phone manufacturers to source all or nearly all of their
                    alkali-AS glass from it, and it also grants rebates to these
                    companies if they do so. Additionally, these phone makers
                    must tell Corning if they receive competitive offers from
                    other glass manufacturers. They aren’t allowed to accept
                    these offers unless Corning cannot match or beat the price.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similarly, Corning has agreements with companies that
                    process raw glass, forcing them to get all or most of their
                    alkali-AS glass from Corning. They also aren’t allowed to
                    challenge Corning patents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These charges reinforce how aggressive Corning is in
                    defending its dominant position in the smartphone glass
                    screen market. The latest Apple and Android devices, like
                    the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-9-review-the-go-to-android-smartphone-133005548.html"
                      >Google Pixel 9</a
                    >, usually have Gorilla Glass screens, as they’re
                    scratch-resistant and prevent cracking or breaking. While
                    not indestructible, the glass does hold up well against
                    damage. However, Corning’s market dominance coupled with
                    these practices are enough to get the EU’s attention.

                    “We in public health need to cast a wider net of who we
                    offer a test,” said Shah at a press conference today. “Going
                    forward, the CDC is expanding its testing recommendation to
                    include workers who were exposed [to H5N1] and do not have
                    symptoms.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The agency is also recommending that antiviral medications
                    be offered to asymptomatic workers who have a high-risk
                    exposure, like those on dairy farms who may get raw milk
                    splashed on their face. That way, if they do contract the
                    virus, a lower amount of it will be circulating within them,
                    which in turn lowers the risk of it spreading to other
                    people. “The less room we give this virus to run, the fewer
                    chances we give it to change,” said Shah.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This data also highlights that many H5N1 cases are going
                    undetected – a concern public health officials have long
                    suspected to be true. Yet “we can’t speculate on how many
                    unidentified cases there may be” until we have more data,
                    said Shah.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The CDC is now analysing an additional 150 blood samples
                    collected from veterinarians who work with cattle. When
                    these results become available, they should provide us with
                    a clearer picture of how many cases may be slipping through
                    the cracks, said Shah.

                on a UN-backed treaty which could become the global framework
                for investigating cybercriminals.

              <p>From TFA:</p>

                    The Biden administration plans to support a controversial
                    cybercrime treaty at the United Nations this week despite
                    concerns that it could be misused by authoritarian regimes,
                    according to senior government officials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The agreement would be the first legally binding UN
                    agreement on cybersecurity and could become a global legal
                    framework for countries to cooperate on preventing and
                    investigating cybercriminals. However, critics fear it could
                    be used by authoritarian states to try to pursue dissidents
                    overseas or collect data from political opponents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the officials said there are persuasive reasons to
                    support the treaty. For instance, it would advance the
                    criminalization of child sexual-abuse material and
                    nonconsensual spreading of intimate images, they said.<br />[...]<br />While
                    the treaty is expected to pass the vote in the UN, it was
                    highly unlikely it would be ratified by the US government
                    unless there was implementation of human-rights controls,
                    the official said.

                What say you, Soylentils? "If you have nothing to hide, you have
                nothing to fear?", "We can't let those authoritarian scum
                further oppress their dissidents!" Something in between?

                    In short, cybersecurity in the public sector is a critical
                    matter to society. It should be treated as such. It is not.
                    Unlike transport infrastructure, environment, food and
                    health, it is not regulated. If an aircraft crashes or a
                    novel infection breaks out, certain bodies have a legal duty
                    to investigate and report.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] We need an accident investigator for cybersecurity,
                    one with the power to keep senior execs awake at nights, one
                    to whom nobody can say no. One that looks for reasons, not
                    blame.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the long term, it will save money and lives, make
                    everything easier for everyone with responsibility to keep
                    the wolves in the forest. In the medium term, it will shake
                    up expectations and practices across the sector. And in the
                    short term, it will be exceedingly entertaining. We own the
                    public sector. We set the rules. Let's make it happen.

                    unspecified “national security risks” posed by the company
                    and its parent ByteDance. With the move, TikTok will be
                    forced to “wind up” all business in the country, though the

                    Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne said in a
                    statement. “The decision was based on the information and

                    Canada’s crackdown on TikTok follows a “multi-step national

                    In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson said the company would
                    challenge Canada’s order as well. "Shutting down TikTok’s
                    Canadian offices and destroying hundreds of well-paying

                    “We will challenge this order in court. The TikTok platform
                    will remain available for creators to find an audience,

                    North Korea is not legally allowed to develop or possess
                    nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles under international
                    agreements. It withdrew as a signatory to the Treaty on the
                    Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 2003, citing
                    national security concerns. The United Nations Security
                    Council has since imposed multiple sanctions on North Korea
                    to prevent the development of its weapons programs.

                    at Hong Kong Polytechnic University and his colleagues have
                    conducted a comprehensive analysis of the topographic
                    features in the landing area, combining remote sensing data
                    from satellites with observations from the rover.

                  <p>
                    They say they have found features consistent with the
                    existence of a shoreline in southern Utopia Planitia,
                    including troughs and sediment channels. They also dated and
                    identified the composition of surface deposits in the area.
                    Based on this, the team thinks the ocean existed 3.68
                    billion years ago, but froze and then disappeared around 260
                    million years later.

                    “The findings not only provide further evidence to support
                    the theory of a Martian ocean but also present, for the
                    first time, a discussion on its probable evolutionary
                    scenario,” says Wu.

                    At the heart of the energy transition is a metal transition.
                    Wind farms, solar panels, and electric cars require many
                    times more copper, zinc, and nickel than their gas-powered
                    alternatives. They also require more exotic metals with
                    unique properties, known as rare earth elements, which are
                    essential for the magnets that go into things like wind
                    turbines and EV motors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today, China dominates the processing of rare earth
                    elements, refining around 60 percent of those materials for
                    the world. With demand for such materials forecasted to

                  <p>
                    Substantial quantities of rare earth metals are sitting
                    unused in the United States and many other parts of the
                    world today. The catch is they’re mixed with vast quantities
                    of toxic mining waste.

                  <p>
                    Phoenix Tailings is scaling up a process for harvesting
                    materials, including rare earth metals and nickel, from
                    mining waste. The company uses water and recyclable solvents
                    to collect oxidized metal, then puts the metal into a heated
                    molten salt mixture and applies electricity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The company expects to produce more than 3,000 tons of
                    the metals by 2026, which would have represented about 7
                    percent of total U.S. production last year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, with support from the Department of Energy, Phoenix
                    Tailings is expanding the list of metals it can produce and
                    accelerating plans to build a second production facility.

                  <p>
                    [...] “The key for all of this isn’t just the chemistry, but
                    how everything is linked together, because with rare earths,
                    you have to hit really high purities compared to a
                    conventionally produced metal,” Villalón explains. “As a
                    result, you have to be thinking about the purity of your
                    material the entire way through.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Villalón says the process is economical compared to
                    conventional production methods, produces no toxic
                    byproducts, and is completely carbon free when renewable
                    energy sources are used for electricity.

                    The Woburn facility is currently producing several rare
                    earth elements for customers, including neodymium and
                    dysprosium, which are important in
                    magnets<strong>. </strong>Customers are using the materials
                    for things likewind turbines, electric cars, and defense
                    applications.

                  <p>
                    [...] “We want to take our knowledge from processing the
                    rare earth metals and slowly move it into other segments,”
                    Villalón explains. “We simply have to refine some of these
                    materials here. There’s no way we can’t. So, what does that
                    look like from a regulatory perspective? How do we create
                    approaches that are economical and environmentally compliant
                    not just now, but 30 years from now?”

                    Every day, billions of cells in the human body die thanks to
                    a natural process known as apoptosis. When apoptosis doesn't
                    work by design, cells get cancerous and can cause a
                    life-threatening illness. Now, researchers at Stanford

                    describes a way to re-activate apoptosis in mutated cells,
                    which would amount to forcing cancer to self-destruct
                    through a bioengineered, bonding molecule.

                    Gerald Crabtree, one of the study's authors and a professor
                    of development biology,
                    <a
                      href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/10/protein-cancer.html"

                    he had the idea while hiking through Kings Mountain,
                    California, during the pandemic period. The new compound
                    would have to bind two proteins which already exist in the
                    cancerous cells, turning apoptosis back on and making the
                    cancer kill itself.
                  </p>

                    "We essentially want to have the same kind of specificity
                    that can eliminate 60 billion cells with no bystanders,"
                    Crabtree said, so that no cell gets destroyed if it isn't
                    the proper target of this new killing mechanism. The two
                    proteins in question are known as BCL6, an oncogene which
                    suppresses apoptosis-promoting genes in the B-cell lymphoma,
                    and CDK9, an enzyme that catalyzes gene activation instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mutated BCL6 proteins block a signal that should normally
                    bring cancerous cells to activate apoptosis. Traditional,
                    non-destructive cancer treatments have been targeting
                    oncogenes to try and shut the cancer down, while the new
                    study proposes a mechanism to exploit them instead. "You
                    take something that the cancer is addicted to for its
                    survival and you flip the script and make that be the very
                    thing that kills it," Crabtree said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team is now testing the molecule on mice affected
                    by diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, to see if the method is
                    effective at killing cancer in living animals. The technique
                    relies on the natural supply of BCL6 and CDK9 in cells,
                    which means it will likely work only on cancerous lymphomas.
                    After testing the new molecule with 859 different types of
                    cancer cells in the lab, the researchers confirmed that it
                    was able to kill only diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma
                    cells.

                    Have you ever wished for a 500 Hz, millimeter-precise linear
                    position sensing system? Well you're in luck — all you need
                    is some circuit board, a basic microcontroller, and a wee
                    bit of maths!

                  <p>Why make calipers?</p>
                  <p>
                    Electronic calipers are awesome. This $30 pair has served me
                    well for years, reading far more precision than my skills
                    justify:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such calipers work via capacitive coupling between a PCB on
                    the powered slidey display and a passive PCB "scale" in the
                    stationary spine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Back in March, I idly wondered if the same working principle
                    could be used for a cheap and cheerful "maker-friendly"
                    positioning system. E.g., slide some passive PCB scales into
                    an aluminum extrusion rail, add a capacitive pickup to the
                    bottom of whatever carriage you've got riding along, and
                    tada — you've got sub-mm closed-loop positioning. All for
                    the cost of some PCB, a few GPIO pins, and some firmware (so
                    free, basically).

                    are short-haul flights,” he says. “They could easily be
                    replaced by trains if we were to ban private jets and then
                    invest in real infrastructure.”

                      >a 2016 interview</a

                    wife, who worked at Quantum Computer Services (which later
                    became AOL), heard that the company was looking to add a
                    voice to its software. "I'd been an announcer throughout my
                    entire broadcasting career, and she volunteered me," Edwards
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1989, Edwards recorded the once-ubiquitous phrase, along
                    with "Welcome," "Files done," and "Goodbye" on a cassette
                    tape for just $200. "It started off as a test just to see if
                    it would catch on, and lo and behold, in the mid-90s, it had
                    really caught on."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since then, Edwards has made appearances

                    As a longtime AOL user (yes, I still use AOL to this day),
                    I'm ashamed to admit that I never knew there was a person
                    behind that iconic voice — I thought it was
                    computer-generated. Even now, Edwards' voice will continue
                    to live on in my inbox, which still declares, "You've Got
                    Mail."

                    Administrators are reporting unexpected appearances of
                    Windows Server 2025 after what was published as a security
                    update turned out to be a complete operating system upgrade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem was

                    by a customer of web app security biz Heimdal. Arriving at
                    the office on the morning of November 5, they found, to
                    their horror, that every Windows Server 2022 system had
                    either upgraded itself to Windows Server 2025 or was about
                    to.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sysadmins are cautious by nature, so an unplanned operating
                    system upgrade could easily result in morning coffee being
                    sprayed over a keyboard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Heimdal's services include patch management, and it relies
                    on Microsoft to label patches accurately to ensure the
                    correct update is applied to the correct software at the
                    correct time. In this instance, what should have been a
                    security update turned out to be Windows Server 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It took Heimdal a while to trace the problem.
                    <a
                      href="https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1gk2qdu/windows_2022_servers_unexpectedly_upgrading_to/lvl4of4/"
                      >According to a post</a
                    >
                    on Reddit: "Due to the limited initial footprint,
                    identifying the root cause took some time. By 18:05 UTC, we
                    traced the issue to the Windows Update API, where Microsoft
                    had mistakenly labeled the Windows Server 2025 upgrade as
                    KB5044284."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It added: "Our team discovered this discrepancy in our
                    patching repository, as the GUID for the Windows Server 2025
                    upgrade does not match the usual entries for KB5044284
                    associated with Windows 11. This appears to be an error on
                    Microsoft's side, affecting both the speed of release and
                    the classification of the update. After cross-checking with
                    Microsoft's KB repository, we confirmed that the KB number
                    indeed references Windows 11, not Windows Server 2025."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As of last night, Heimdal estimated that the unexpected
                    upgrade had affected 7 percent of customers – it said it had
                    blocked KB5044284 across all server group policies. However,
                    this is of little comfort to administrators finding
                    themselves receiving an unexpected upgrade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since rolling back to the previous configuration will
                    present a challenge, affected users will be faced with
                    finding out just how effective their backup strategy is or
                    paying for the required license and dealing with all the
                    changes that come with Windows Server 2025.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    An online blogger in China recently asked: how do you clean
                    a flask? But the Mandarin word for flask is xi-jing-ping,
                    which sounds like the name of China's leader, Xi Jin Ping.
                    Government censors suspected the writer was really asking,
                    "How do you get rid the president of China?" They took down
                    the query.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If someone online in China refers to President Xi as a
                    "paratrooper," they may not be hailing him as rugged and
                    resourceful. Paratrooper in Mandarin is san bing, which
                    sounds much like the word for "idiot."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    China's Cyberspace Administration and Ministry of Education
                    has begun what they call the Clear and Bright Campaign to
                    prune the web in China of what they consider "irregular and
                    uncivilized language."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The language bureaucrats aren't just watching for criticism
                    of President Xi, mentions of the Tiananmen Square massacre,
                    or demonstrations in Hong Kong. They want to extinguish the
                    seemingly innocuous phrases many Chinese have ingenuously
                    appropriated to express dissent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When a Chinese censor finds an "irregular" phrase,
                    they eliminate it, but call it "harmonizing". He-xie, the
                    Mandarin word for harmony, sounds like the word for river
                    crab, and so people who have been censored report they have
                    been "river-crabbed."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then there's Cao Ni Ma, the Mandarin name for the mythical
                    grass mud horse. It sounds similar to a phrase that is so
                    profane, I can't even hint at it. The Mandarin phrase for
                    "cover your middle parts", dang zhong yang, sounds close to
                    the name of the Chinese Party Central Committee. And so the
                    artist Ai Weiwei created a music video in which voices sing
                    out, "Grass mud horse and cover your middle part!" in
                    "Gangnam Style," and, "Grass mud horse and river crab!"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wen'guang Huang says the video can't be seen in China, of
                    course. But people there have heard about it, and might hum
                    it in hushed tones. The tune is catchy and appealing — like
                    free speech.

                    "Verizon's petition for review stems from the multiple and
                    significant errors that the FCC, in purporting to enforce
                    statutory consumer data privacy provisions, made in
                    overstepping its authority," Verizon wrote. "The FCC's
                    Forfeiture Order violated both the Communications Act and
                    the Constitution, while failing to benefit the consumers it
                    purported to protect."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Verizon and AT&amp;T both said the fines violate their
                    Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, and that the
                    location data doesn't fall under the law cited by the FCC.
                    Verizon appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the 2nd
                    Circuit, while AT&amp;T appealed in the 5th Circuit and
                    T-Mobile appealed in the DC Circuit.

                  <p>
                    The fines are $80.1 million for T-Mobile, $57.3 million for
                    AT&amp;T, $46.9 million for Verizon, and $12.2 million for

                So what say you, Soylentils? Are AT&amp;T and Verizon correct in
                saying that the FCC has no authority to levy fines? Is selling
                your location data without your consent ethical/legal? If you
                answer 'no' to both, who <i>does</i> have such authority? If you
                answer 'yes' to both, why? If you mix 'yes' and 'no', why?

                    Most people dread a letter from the tax office. So spare a

                    In an administrative meltdown worthy of a Franz Kafka novel,
                    the mountain of tax correspondence arrived at his front door
                    in 10 boxes, a local newspaper reported.

                    Germany's finance ministry apologised on Wednesday for the
                    "technical error" that threw the man from Quickborn in

                    non-competitive and non-independent prices, ensuring

                    disrupted an ecommerce fraud ring they say has been in
                    operation for five years, infecting more than a thousand
                    websites and raking in tens of millions of dollars from
                    hundreds of thousands of victims in the process.

                    Victims who buy products are presented with a legitimate
                    payment processor page, so the transaction is technically
                    real - but there's no product, and nothing ever shows up. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Satori said it managed to get the fake listings it
                    discovered pulled from Google SERPs, and victimized payment
                    processors have banned Phish 'n' Ships operators from their
                    platforms, but it's probably not safe yet.

                    "It's unlikely the threat actors will pull the plug on their
                    work without trying to find a new way to perpetuate their
                    fraud," Satori said.

                    You may have seen a photo floating around the Internet that
                    depicts a gaggle of Mavericks—not the pickup, but the
                    econo-coupe that preceded it—lurking in what appears to be
                    some type of natural cave. Dig a little deeper, and you
                    might even stumble across a sentence or two explaining that
                    these unlikely spelunkers represent overstock stuffed by
                    Ford into a subterranean system carved deep beneath the
                    bedrock of Missouri.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The image might seem an oddball anachronism, some kind of
                    temporary solution to overflowing dealer lots that somehow
                    made sense in the 1970s. Would it surprise you to find out
                    that Ford is actually entering its seventh decade of keeping
                    cars in said caves, which are part of a vast business
                    complex called SubTropolis?
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    Although Hunt Midwest works with other automotive partners
                    at SubTropolis, Ford is truly the anchor tenant. With its
                    Kansas City plant still building the F-150 pickup (as it has
                    since 1957), and another nearby Missouri facility churning
                    out the Transit van, the company's underground presence has
                    grown alongside both of those product lines.
