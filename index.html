                    Since at least Aristotle, writers and scholars have debated
                    what makes for a great story. One of them is
                    <a
                      href="https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/the-rotman-experience/our-community/people/knight-samsun/"
                      >Samsun Knight</a
                    >, a novelist who is also an economist and assistant
                    professor of marketing at the University of Toronto's Rotman
                    School of Management. With a scientist's tools, he's done
                    what previous theorizers have failed to: put theory to the
                    test and demonstrate the key factor for empirically
                    predicting which stories will be snore fests and which will
                    leave audiences hungry for more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It turns out to be "narrative reversals" -- lots of them and
                    the bigger the better. Commonly known as changes of fortune
                    or turning points, where characters' fortunes swing from
                    good to bad and vice versa, Prof. Knight and fellow
                    researchers found that stories rich in these mechanisms
                    boosted popularity and engagement with audiences through a
                    range of media, from television to crowdfunding pitches.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The best-written stories were always either 'building up' a
                    current reversal, or introducing a new plot point," says
                    Prof. Knight. "In our analysis, the best writers were those
                    that were able to maintain both many plot points and strong
                    build-up for each plot point across the course of the
                    narrative."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers analyzed nearly 30,000 television shows,
                    movies, novels, and crowdfunding pitches using computational
                    linguistics, a blend of computer science and language
                    analysis. This allowed them to quantify not only the number
                    of a reversals in a text but also their degree or intensity
                    by assigning numerical values to words based on how positive
                    or negative they were.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Movies and television shows with more and bigger reversals
                    were better rated on the popular ratings site IMDb. Books
                    with the most and biggest reversals were downloaded more
                    than twice as much as books with the fewest reversals from
                    the free online library Project Gutenberg. And GoFundMe
                    pitches with more and larger reversals were more likely to
                    hit their fundraising goal, by as much as 39 per cent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Greek philosopher Aristotle was the first to identify
                    peripeteia, the sudden reversal of circumstances, as a key
                    feature of a good story. Other thinkers have added their
                    ideas since then, including American playwright and
                    dramaturg Leon Katz whose scholarship particularly inspired
                    Prof. Knight's research. Katz "described the reversal as the
                    basic unit of narrative, just as a sentence is the basic
                    unit of a paragraph, or the syllogism is the basic unit of a
                    logical proof," says Prof. Knight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to helping psychologists understand how
                    narrative works to educate, inform and inspire people, the
                    findings may also benefit storytellers of all kinds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Hopefully our research can help build a pedagogy for
                    writers that allows them to rely on the accumulated
                    knowledge of Aristotle et al. without having to 'reinvent
                    the wheel' on their own every time," says Prof. Knight.

                    [...] When Constellation signaled interest in restarting
                    Three Mile Island in July, doubts surfaced about the
                    technical feasibility of the project. Not only would it be
                    the first of its kind, but it will have to be accomplished
                    next to another reactor whose clean-up and decommissioning
                    is expected to continue through 2078.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The site also remains politically contentious due to the
                    lasting memory of the 1979 accident, which displaced
                    surrounding communities and left a legacy of fear over
                    whether the radiation released contributed to increased
                    cancer rates in the vicinity. About 2 million people were
                    exposed to radioactive fallout as a result of the meltdown.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Public health researchers from Temple, Penn State and the
                    University of Pittsburgh published a report last year
                    finding that long-term studies into the impact of the
                    meltdown were limited by research flaws.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite these concerns, Constellation cited a statewide poll
                    showing strong support for restarting Three Mile Island. The
                    poll conducted by Susquehanna Polling &amp; Research found
                    Pennsylvania residents approve of restarting Three Mile
                    Island by more than 2-1 and 70% favor the ongoing use of
                    nuclear energy in the state.

                    scientists in South Gloucestershire and supported by the

                    known AnWj blood group antigen, which was discovered in 1972
                    but unknown until now after this world-first test was
                    developed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Senior research scientist at NHSBT Louise Tilley said the
                    discovery means better care to rare patients can be offered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ms Tilley, who has worked on the project for 20 years, told
                    the BBC it is "quite difficult to a put a number" on how
                    many people will benefit from the test. However, the NHSBT
                    is the last resort for about 400 patients across the world
                    each year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Everyone has proteins outside their red blood cells known as
                    antigens, but a small number might lack them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using genetic testing, NHSBT's International Blood Group
                    Reference Laboratory in Filton have for the first time
                    developed a test that will identify patients missing this
                    antigen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The test could prove a lifesaver for those who would react
                    against a blood transfusion, and will make it easier to find
                    potential blood developers for this rare blood type.

                    Philip Brown, who works at the laboratory, was diagnosed
                    with a form of leukaemia about 20 years ago.

                    He had blood transfusions and a bone marrow transplant -
                    without that, he would have died.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Anything we can do to make our blood much safer and a
                    better match for patients is a definite step in the right
                    direction," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Head of the laboratory Nicole Thornton said: "Resolving the
                    genetic basis for AnWj has been one of our most challenging
                    projects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There is so much work that goes into proving that a gene
                    does actually encode a blood group antigen, but it is what
                    we are passionate about, making these discoveries for the
                    benefit of rare patients around the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Now genotyping tests can be designed to identify
                    genetically AnWj-negative patients and donors.

                  <p>
                    "Such tests can be added to the existing genotyping

                The result, due to an ongoing effort of just over 20 years, now
                allows for the all developers and users to utilize real-time
                computing without having to target a completely separate OS.
                Embedded systems and live processing will likely see more
                immediate improvements. This support is limited to X86, X86_64,
                ARM64, and RISCV and only capable of hard real time on hardware
                that supports it. However, the new competition and interest will
                likely spur on more developments in Real-Time Computing the

                One final note is that enabling PREEMPT_RT is not a panacea
                leading to better performance. Real time computing and real-time
                OSes sacrifice maximum throughput for guaranteed latency with
                minimal jitter. Real time does not mean "as fast as possible."
                Real time means "not too slow." In the wrong situation, it can
                actually make your performance worse.

                    The United States has recently, as you know discovered rich
                    hydrogen resources within the country that would alter the
                    current energy situation. The use of hydrogen is gradually
                    becoming an indispensable measure in the shift towards the
                    non-utilization of fossil resources.

                  <p>
                    The DoE has noted massive under ground pool of hydrogen
                    energy in various places across the country. Hydrogen, the
                    first, lightest element on the periodic table of elements,
                    is the most abundant element in the universe and yet, the
                    discovery of hydrogen in concentrated form in this planet
                    has been a task.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    New assessments hence show the prospect that these domestic
                    supplies can be used to fuel automobiles, factories and even
                    electrification. Promising innovation and development in
                    infrastructure, hydrogen is capable of powering America's
                    tomorrow.

                    Scientists in United States have found that there exist very
                    huge resources of hydrogen gaseous fuel trapped beneath the
                    surface of the earth, that can sustain all consumers for
                    hundreds of years. The Department of Energy has claimed that
                    the resources of hydrogen in some parts of the country to be
                    in trillions of dollars.

                  <p>
                    This natural hydrogen was generated through geo-chemical
                    processes, it has been confined within underlying rocks and
                    sediments. Though hydrogen is present in immensely massive
                    quantities in the universe, localized, denser sources here
                    on Earth are relatively scarce.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If one uses the correct technology then one can know that
                    this enormous source of clean energy could fuel the society
                    for ages. A key advantage here is that the hydrogen does not
                    have to be produced, which means there is no environmental
                    and economic cost associated with its production.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Accessing these hydrogen resources is one of the prospects
                    for shifting the oil and gas industry to a new level of
                    energy production. However, it must be noted that there are
                    technical issues that can be associated with scaling of
                    hydrogen release and the efficient harvesting of hydrogen in

                    Signs of huge deposits of hydrogen have known to exist
                    underground in different sedimentary basins in the United
                    States of America. They contain the world's largest deposits
                    mainly in the western part of the USA in Texas, New Mexico,
                    Utah and Colorado.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These areas contain trillions of cubic feet of hydrogen gas
                    dislocated in rock structures at depths of the earth crust.
                    These hydrogen sources were generated from deposits of
                    natural gas that over millions of years interacted with
                    water and rock to create whatis referred to as hydrostatic
                    hydrogen or hydrostatic pressure.

                    The largest Onshore Basin in the View of Oil and Gas
                    Resources is the Gulf Coast Basin which Texas possesses some
                    of the greatest extents. San Juan Basin is endowed with the
                    major natural resources in New Mexico. Another region that
                    holds extensive amounts is the Uinta Basin of Utah.

                    A recent study finds that hope appears to be more beneficial
                    than mindfulness at helping people manage stress and stay
                    professionally engaged during periods of prolonged stress at
                    work. The study underscores the importance of looking ahead,
                    rather than living "in the moment," during hard times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mindfulness refers to the ability of an individual to focus
                    attention on the present, in a way that is open, curious and
                    not judgmental. Essentially, the ability to be fully in the
                    moment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There's a lot of discussion about the benefits of
                    mindfulness, but it poses two challenges when you're going
                    through periods of stress," says Tom Zagenczyk, co-author of
                    a paper on the work and a professor of management in North
                    Carolina State University's Poole College of Management.
                    "First, it's hard to be mindful when you're experiencing
                    stress. Second, if it's a truly difficult time, you don't
                    necessarily want to dwell too much on the experience you're
                    going through.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Fundamentally, our findings tell us that hope was
                    associated with people being happy, and mindfulness was
                    not," says Kristin Scott, study co-author and a professor of
                    management at Clemson University. "And when people are
                    hopeful – and happy – they experience less distress, are
                    more engaged with their work, and feel less tension related
                    to their professional lives."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Being mindful can be tremendously valuable – there are
                    certainly advantages to living in the moment," says Sharon
                    Sheridan, study co-author and an assistant professor of
                    management at Clemson. "But it's important to maintain a
                    hopeful outlook – particularly during periods of prolonged
                    stress. People should be hopeful while being mindful – hold
                    on to the idea that there's a light at the end of the
                    tunnel."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the study focused on musicians during an extreme set
                    of circumstances, the researchers think there is a takeaway
                    message that is relevant across industry sectors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Whenever we have high levels of job stress, it's important
                    to be hopeful and forward looking," says Emily Ferrise,
                    study co-author and a Ph.D. student at Clemson. "And to the
                    extent possible, there is real value for any organization to
                    incorporate hope and forward thinking into their corporate
                    culture – through job conditions, organizational
                    communications, etc."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Every work sector experiences periods of high stress," says
                    Zagenczyk. "And every company should be invested in having
                    happy employees who are engaged with their work."

                    The US and Japan are close to a deal to curb tech exports to
                    China's chip industry despite alarm in Tokyo about Beijing's

                    The White House wants to unveil new export controls before
                    November's presidential election, including a measure
                    forcing non-US companies to get licences to sell products to

                    Biden administration officials have spent months in intense

                  <p>
                    People in Washington and Tokyo familiar with the talks said
                    the US and Japan were now close to a breakthrough, although
                    a Japanese official cautioned the situation remained "quite
                    fragile" because of fears of Chinese retaliation.

                  <p>
                    [...] The US export controls are designed to close loopholes
                    in existing rules and add restrictions that reflect the fast
                    progress of Huawei and other Chinese groups in chip
                    production over the past two years.

                    [...] China said it "firmly opposes the abuse of export
                    controls" and urged "relevant countries" to abide by
                    international economic and trade rules.

                    [...] Most differences in colour perception are
                    physiological, like colour blindness, which affects one in
                    10 men and one in 100 women. Others, however, may be
                    connected to aspects of culture or language.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity,
                    popularised in the movie Arrival<em>,</em> suggests that
                    language shapes the way we think, and even how we perceive
                    the world. In the 1930s, Benjamin Lee Whorf argued that the
                    world consisted of "a kaleidoscopic flux of impressions
                    organised ... largely by the linguistic systems of our
                    minds", pointing to, for instance, the Inuits' multiple
                    words for "snow" as an example of differences in cultural
                    perceptions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although this theory continues to be hotly debated
                    throughout linguistics, psychology and philosophy, language
                    does inform how we communicate ideas. There's no word for
                    "blue" in ancient Greek, for example, which is why Homer
                    described stormy seas as "wine-dark" in The Odyssey. By
                    contrast, Russian has distinct words for light blue and dark
                    blue. However,
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2001946117"
                      >recent research</a
                    >
                    suggests a greater vocabulary may only be beneficial for
                    remembering colours and not for perceiving them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before you fight online about whether a particular shade is
                    aqua or cyan, it's important to note that ismy.blue's
                    results have limitations. The slightest variation in viewing
                    conditions influences colour perception, which is why vision
                    researchers take such care when designing experiments.
                    Factors like the model of your phone or computer, its age,
                    display settings, ambient light sources, time of day and
                    even which colour is presented first in the test will all
                    play a role in your responses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Night modes in particular increase the redness of a device's
                    screen, causing blues to appear greener. To see if this was
                    influencing test results, Mineault separated the data into
                    two groups: before or after 6pm. The effect was immediately
                    apparent, especially on devices with built-in night modes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So what's the point of ismy.blue if it's so variable? In the
                    end, it's just entertainment. But if you'd like results with
                    a little more equivalence, Mineault suggests doing the
                    exercise with others on the same device, so that
                    "everybody's in the same lighting and the same place".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] One question remains, though: what colour is the
                    blanket?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We've taken the test a bunch of times," says Mineault. "As
                    soon as there's a little green in there, I call it green";
                    his wife sees blue.
                  </p>
                  <p>The solution? Maybe just buy a new one.</p>

                    Denis Villeneuve can't stop making movies based on books.
                    The Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 director has delivered two
                    high-budget and polished Dune blockbusters in a row, while a
                    third is on the way. He also has three other book
                    adaptations in the works for when he's finished with Paul
                    Atreides, and the director finally gave a promising update
                    on one of those projects that could be the perfect follow-up
                    to Dune.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a conversation with Vanity Fair, Villeneuve addressed the
                    three other book-based movies he has in development:
                    Cleopatra, based on the biography by Stacy Schiff, Nuclear
                    War: A Scenario, based on the nonfiction book by Annie
                    Jacobsen, and Rendezvous With Rama, based on the sci-fi
                    novel by Arthur C. Clarke. "I'm working on Rendezvous With
                    Rama and that screenplay is slowly moving forward," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rendezvous with Rama isn't nearly as well known as Clarke's
                    best-known novel, 2001: A Space Odyssey, but it's definitely
                    well-suited to Villeneuve's mystical, epic style. The first
                    book in a series, Rendezvous with Rama follows a group of
                    human explorers in the distant future as they explore a
                    mysterious alien spaceship that's hurtling towards the sun.

                    Publishers, dissatisfied with this system, found a
                    workaround to conduct the auctions outside of Google's
                    purview, a process that became known as "header bidding."
                    Internal Google documents introduced at trial described
                    header bidding as an "existential threat" to Google's market
                    share.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google's response relied on its control of all three
                    components of the process. If publishers conducted an
                    auction outside Google's purview but they still used
                    Google's publisher ad server, called DoubleClick For
                    Publishers, that software forced the winning bid back into
                    Google's Ad Exchange. If Google was willing to match the
                    price that publishers had received under the header-bidding
                    auction, Google would win the auction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Professor Ramamoorthi Ravi, an expert at Carnegie Mellon
                    University, said rules imposed by Google failed to maximize
                    value for publishers and "seem to have been designed to
                    advantage Google's own products."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Google, for its part, says it hasn't run auctions this
                    way since 2019, and that in the last five years Google's
                    share of the display ad market has begun to erode. It says
                    that tying its buy side, sell side and middleman products
                    together helps them run seamlessly and quickly, and
                    minimizes fraudulent ads or malware risks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google also says its innovations over the last 15 years
                    fueled the improvements in matching online ads to consumer
                    interests. Google says it was at the forefront of
                    introducing "real-time bidding," which allowed an advertiser
                    selling shoes, for instance, to be paired up with a consumer
                    whose online profile indicated an interest in purchasing
                    shoes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those innovations, according to Google, allowed publishers
                    to sell their available ad space at a premium because the
                    advertiser would know that the ad was going to the eyeballs
                    of someone interested in their product or service.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Justice Department says that even though Google no
                    longer runs its auctions in the ways described, it helped
                    Google maintain its monopoly in the ad tech market in the
                    years leading up to 2019, and that its existing monopoly
                    allows Google to keep up to 36 cents on the dollar of every
                    ad purchase it brokers when the transaction runs through all
                    of its various products.

                    [...] You'll notice that our suggested counters to deep
                    doubt above do not include watermarks, metadata, or AI
                    detectors as ideal solutions. That's because trust does not
                    inherently derive from the authority of a software tool. And
                    while AI and deepfakes have dramatically accelerated the
                    issue, bringing us to this new "deep doubt" era, the
                    necessity of finding reliable sources of information about
                    events you didn't witness firsthand is as old as history

                    synthesized digital media artifacts will be completely
                    indistinguishable from human-created ones. That means there
                    may be no reliable automated way to determine if a
                    convincingly created media artifact was human or
                    machine-generated solely by looking at one piece of media in
                    isolation (remember the sermon on context above). This is
                    already true of text, which has resulted in many
                    human-authored works being falsely labeled
                    [thedailybeast.com] as AI-generated, creating ongoing pain

                    Throughout history, any form of recorded media, including

                    [researchgate.net]. And since the invention of photography,

                    In 1338, among a scattering of obscure villages just to the
                    west of Lake Issyk-Kul, Kyrgyzstan, people began dropping
                    dead in droves. Among the many headstones found in the
                    cemeteries of Kara-Djigach and Burana, one can read epitaphs
                    such as "This is the grave of Kutluk. He died of the plague
                    with his wife." Recently, ancient DNA exhumed from these
                    sites has confirmed the presence of the plague bacterium
                    <em>Yersinia pestis</em>, cause of the condition that became
                    known as the Black Death. The strain detected in those
                    remote graveyards of Central Asia has been identified as the
                    most recent common ancestor of the plague that went on to
                    kill as much as 60% of the Eurasian population in the great
                    pandemic of the 14th-century.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In 2018, a team of researchers found ancient traces of
                    the plague bacterium in 4900-year old remains in Sweden. A
                    few years later, traces of the bacterium were found in a
                    5000-year old skull in Latvia. It was tentatively suggested
                    that these finds correlate with the Neolithic Decline, and
                    might explain the large die off within these farming
                    societies. However the cases were isolated, with some of the
                    infected buried with uninfected, suggesting there wasn't an
                    epidemic comparable to the Black Death outbreaks that would
                    come in later millenniums.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Whether the Neolithic Decline was mostly, or in part,
                    caused by the plague is still up for debate, but one thing
                    is clear: humanity has been battling
                    <em>Yersinia pestis</em> for a long, long time.

                    A key Senate Committee is about to vote on two bills that
                    would bring back some of the worst patents and empower
                    patent trolls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Patent Eligibility Restoration Act (PERA), S. 2140,
                    would throw out crucial rules that ban patents on many
                    abstract ideas. Courts will be ordered to approve patents on
                    things like ordering food on a mobile phone or doing basic
                    financial functions online. If PERA Passes, the floodgates
                    will open for these vague software patents that will be used
                    to sue small companies and individuals. This bill even
                    allows for a type of patent on human genes that the Supreme
                    Court rightly disallowed in 2013.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A second bill, the PREVAIL Act, S. 2220, would sharply limit
                    the public's right to challenge patents that never should
                    have been granted in the first place.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Patent trolls—companies that have no product or service of
                    their own, but simply make patent infringement demands on
                    others—are a big problem. They've cost our economy billions
                    of dollars. For a small company, a patent troll demand
                    letter can be ruinous.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We took a big step towards fighting off patent trolls in
                    2014, when a landmark Supreme Court ruling, the Alice Corp.
                    v. CLS Bank case, established that you can't get a patent by
                    adding "on a computer" to an abstract idea. In 2012,
                    Congress also expanded the ways that a patent can be
                    challenged at the patent office.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These two bills, PERA and PREVAIL, would roll back both of
                    those critical protections against patent trolls. We know
                    that the bill sponsors, Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Chris
                    Coons (D-DE) are pushing hard for these bills to move
                    forward. We need your help to tell Congress that it's the
                    wrong move.

                We have been getting stories for a while about how JWST
                observations don't line up with the current Big Bang timelines.
                I'm certain there will be "Big Bang Band Aid" theories at least
                until the current crop of Astrophysicists who built their entire
                career on the semi-biblical "In the Beginning..." theory of
                where it all started have, themselves, died off. Meanwhile,
                there is also never a shortage of contrarian theories out there,
                and one of them is starting to get some support from the JWST
                observations of the "deep past" - which, maybe, isn't so deep
                after all.
              </p>
              <p>
                Current theories for the redshift observed in more distant
                galaxies rely on the postulate: "photons travel at the speed of
                light and arrive unchanged at their destination, exactly when
                they left their source, from their perspective."
              </p>
              <p>
                There are other theories. One, in particular, explains the
                observed redshifts with the idea that photons "get tired" on
                their Billions of light year journeys and lose a little
                frequency / gain a little wavelength along the way. JWST
                observations that are seeing mature galaxies back at, and
                before, the previously presumed start of "it all" may align
                better with the less well developed tiring photon theory than
                they do with the Big Bang. Not only does the "tired light"
                theory directly explain red-shift, but the observations of
                wavelength shift with respect to galactic rotation seem to be
                lining up better with "tired light" than "Big Bang," too...

                    came up with a different idea.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He proposed that the redshift we see in distant galaxies —
                    basically a shift in the light spectrum towards red — might
                    not be because those galaxies are speeding away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead, he thought that the light photons from these
                    galaxies could be losing energy, or "tiring out," as they
                    travel through space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This energy loss could make it look like the farther
                    galaxies are moving away from us faster than they actually
                    are.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                quite a bit bigger than we have been guessing it is?

                A Tesla Semi's fiery crash on California's Interstate 80 turned

                    The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported
                    that CAL FIRE had to use a jaw-dropping 50,000 gallons of
                    water, alongside fire-retardant airdrops, to put out the
                    blaze. The crash and subsequent fire shut down eastbound
                    lanes of I-80 for a staggering 15 hours, as reported by
                    <a

                    The Tesla electric big rig, driven by a Tesla employee,
                    veered off the road on August 19, smashing into a traffic
                    post and a tree before careening down a slope and igniting a
                    post-crash inferno. Fortunately, no one was injured.
                    However, the NTSB's report sheds light on the difficulty of
                    extinguishing fires in electric vehicles. Tesla's infamous
                    "thermal runaway" effect—the tendency of lithium-ion
                    batteries to reignite hours after being "put out"—was a
                    constant concern, but the semi's battery system stayed under
                    control this time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The blaze and the hazardous materials response that
                    followed created chaos along I-80, a key artery linking
                    Northern California with Nevada. Traffic was rerouted, and
                    the full shutdown stretched late into the evening, causing
                    significant delays.

                you. So they had "pagers", also called "beepers," that alerted
                you to call the office.

                They're not supposed to blow up. This is James Bond stuff. Since
                the Israelis can listen in to every cell phone call in the area,
                Hezbollah needed a secure way to communicate, so used pagers.
                But who loaded them with explosives? How? Pagers weren't big,
                the explosive must be high tech.

                  <p>
                    Large Language Models (LLMs) have not only fascinated
                    technologists and researchers but have also captivated the
                    general public. Leading the charge, OpenAI ChatGPT has
                    inspired the release of numerous open-source models. In this
                    post, I explore the dynamics that are driving the
                    commoditization of LLMs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Low switching costs are a key factor supporting the
                    commoditization of Large Language Models (LLMs). The
                    simplicity of transitioning from one LLM to another is
                    largely due to the use of a common language (English) for
                    queries. This uniformity allows for minimal cost when
                    switching, akin to navigating between different e-commerce
                    websites. While LLM providers might use various APIs, these
                    differences are not substantial enough to significantly
                    raise switching costs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In contrast, transitioning between different database
                    systems involves considerable expense and complexity. It
                    requires migrating data, updating configurations, managing
                    traffic shifts, adapting to different query languages or
                    dialects, and addressing performance issues. Adding
                    long-term memory [<a
                      href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogcacm/the-commoditization-of-llms/#four"
                      >4</a
                    >] to LLMs could increase their value to businesses at the
                    cost of making it more expensive to switch providers.
                    However, for uses that require only the basic functions of
                    LLMs and do not need memory, the costs associated with
                    switching remain minimal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Open source models like Llama and Mistral allow
                    multiple infrastructure providers to enter the market,
                    enhancing competition and lowering the cost of AI services.
                    These models also benefit from community-driven
                    improvements, which in turn benefits the organizations that
                    originally developed them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, open source LLMs serve as a foundation for
                    future research, making experimentation more affordable and
                    reducing the potential for differentiation among competing
                    products. This mirrors the impact of Linux in the server
                    industry, where its rise enabled a variety of providers to
                    offer standardized server solutions at reduced costs,
                    thereby commoditizing server technology.

                    The HP-12c is probably the most iconic financial calculator.
                    Not being in finance myself, and in fact being terribly bad
                    at that kind of thing, I never quite got the purpose of
                    these special-purpose devices. My ignorance came to a halt
                    due to an unfortunate combination of my fixed-rate mortgage
                    period ending and Liz Truss happening, and I was driven to a
                    sudden keen interest in the 'time value of money' (TVM)
                    calculation.
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    Earlier this year I came across a fairly benign-looking
                    reddit post describing some difficulty changing the decimal
                    point to a decimal comma on a new Brazilian-bought HP-12c.
                    Most of the replies were along the lines of 'you're holding
                    it wrong', but something caught my attention. They weren't
                    the only one, and not only had someone else had the same
                    experience, I was pointed to numerous Amazon reviews
                    describing similar woes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To find out for myself, I VPN'd myself over to the Brazilian
                    Amazon and started reading (with the assistance of my phone
                    and google translate) reviews. What I saw was quite
                    consistent - people couldn't change the point to the comma,
                    and the calculator also failed on something called the
                    internal rate of return (IRR) calculation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was curious, were these a different version of the HP-12c?
                    Was it a fake? It is generally accepted that the HP-12c (and
                    to some degree the related HP-12c platinum) will return
                    exactly the same results no matter. Why would it otherwise?
                    It was at this point I needed help, and a very kind
                    Brazilian redditor did the work needed to run the
                    aforementioned TVM tests as a forensic tool. What they found
                    was a set of results entirely different to not just the
                    regular HP-12c, but to any other financial calculator we had
                    tested.

                    pension fraud, and they also have the worst records. For
                    example, the best place to reach 105 in England is Tower

                    I hope so. But even if not, at least the general public will
                    laugh and think about it, even if the scientific community
                    is still a bit prickly and defensive. If they don't
                    acknowledge their errors in my lifetime, I guess I'll just
                    get someone to pretend I'm still alive until that changes.

                    Less than 2% of the EU's heavy freight vehicles are now
                    electric and hydrogen-powered. To meet the bloc's carbon
                    emission reduction targets, the share should rise to 40% of
                    new sales by 2030, the study released before the IAA
                    Transportation 2024 truck show in Hanover showed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Currently production costs for electric trucks are 2.5-3
                    times higher than for diesel ones, the study said, and with
                    logistics firms unwilling to accept higher costs for
                    emissions-free freight, that goal is still distant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To overcome that, prices for new electric trucks should be
                    no more than 30% higher than for diesel models, McKinsey
                    said, which would require a technological leap in batteries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For successful implementation of the EU's CO2 strategy, a
                    25% cut in charging costs is also needed, the study showed,
                    with 900,000 private charging points to be installed in
                    Europe by 2035, which would require a $20 billion
                    investment.

                    to be behind the Charles Darwin School attack. In a post on
                    the criminals' dark-web blog, they say they stole 200 GB of

                    more frequently despite having the latest security measures
                    in place," he said. "Our understanding of our situation is
                    that it is similar to what was experienced by the NHS,
                    Transport for London, National Rail, other schools and

                    attacking schools in Washington state and the UK," Semperis
                    principal technologist Sean Deuby told
                    <em>The Register</em>, adding that schools are more
                    vulnerable targets because of their smaller IT budgets and
                    fewer defensive resources. "Attacking just before the first
                    day of school for young kindergartners demonstrates their
                    amorality."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the Seattle-area district hasn't called the incident
                    ransomware, "reading between the lines on these attacks
                    leads me to believe that the schools were hit by
                    ransomware," Deuby opined.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Most schools today use Office 365 but still depend
                    upon their on-premises identity system, Active Directory,
                    for its users," Deuby said, adding that this makes
                    exploiting Microsoft AD vulnerabilities more enticing to
                    criminals. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While there's "no silver bullet" to solve schools' security
                    challenges, he suggests working with their IT providers to
                    identify critical services "such as AD that are single
                    points of failure." 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If critical services go down, school stops, and the school
                    buses don't roll," Deuby noted. "Have a plan for what to do.
                    This doesn't have to be perfect but think now about what to
                    do if email goes away or a teacher portal is locked."

                    GPU offerings represent a new push.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their current model, the 9A1000, is a pretty tame GPU aimed
                    at budget systems and low-end AI tasks. But the 9A2000 is
                    allegedly taking things to the next level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Loongson's Chairman and General Manager Hu
                    Weiwu, the 9A2000 delivers performance up to 10 times higher
                    than its predecessor. He claimed it should be "comparable to
                    Nvidia RTX 2080,"
                    <a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/794/762.htm">according</a>
                    to ITHome.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] That said, Loongson has another card to play. At the
                    same briefing, Weiwu also provided a teaser for their
                    next-gen 3B6600 CPU, making some lofty performance claims
                    about its architecture. He touted "significant" changes
                    under the hood that should elevate its single-threaded
                    muscle to "world-leading" levels,
                    <a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/794/753.htm">according</a>
                    to another ITHome report.

                    Previous leaks suggest this processor will pack eight LA864
                    cores clocked at a stout 3GHz, along with integrated LG200
                    graphics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for the launch, Weiwu gave a tentative first half of 2025
                    target for initial production, with mass availability
                    hopefully following in the second half of next year.

                    Arrays of gene variants in Thorin’s DNA more closely align
                    with the previously reported DNA structure of Neandertals
                    that lived around 105,000 years ago, versus Neandertals
                    dating to around 50,000 to 40,000 years ago. Yet analyses of
                    carbon and other diet-related chemical elements in Thorin’s
                    bones and teeth suggest that he lived during an ice age,
                    which did not develop in Europe until about 50,000 years
                    ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thorin also inherited from his parents an unusually high
                    percentage of DNA segments containing consecutive pairs of
                    identical gene variants.
                    <a

                      in Siberian Neandertals</a

                    population (<em>SN: 10/19/22</em>).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Taken together, the genetic evidence fits a scenario in
                    which Thorin belonged to a Neandertal lineage that split
                    from other European Neandertals around 105,000 years ago,
                    the researchers say. For roughly the next 50,000 years, they
                    suspect, Thorin’s lineage consisted of small networks of
                    closely related communities that exchanged mates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Reasons why those ancient groups avoided mating with other
                    Neandertals in the region, possibly related to language or
                    cultural differences, are unclear, Sikora says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “If Thorin is really 50,000 years old, this would be
                    an amazing finding showing a strong genetic structure in
                    late Neandertals,” says paleogeneticist Cosimo Posth of the
                    University of Tübingen in Germany. But, he says, further
                    excavation and research at Grotte Mandrin will need to
                    confirm when Thorin lived.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers found Thorin’s remains in a small, natural
                    depression on the rock shelter floor. Slimak’s and Sikora’s
                    group cannot yet say how the body got there or whether it
                    originated in older sediment. An older date for the partial
                    skeleton would indicate, less surprisingly, that Thorin
                    belonged to an isolated population that petered out quickly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Long-term isolation would have resulted in Thorin inheriting
                    a greater number of short DNA segments containing identical
                    gene pairs than reported in the new study, Lalueza-Fox says.
                    Isolating more of Thorin’s DNA or collecting genetic
                    remnants from other fossil members of his lineage will
                    clarify the evolutionary story of these close-knit
                    Neandertals, he says.

                    [...] As a daily tech news writer, I keep an eye on the
                    latest innovations in AI image generation. Late last month
                    while browsing Reddit, I noticed a post from an AI imagery
                    hobbyist who goes by the name "<a
                      href="https://x.com/fofrAI"
                      >fofr</a
                    >"—pronounced "Foffer," he told me, so let's call him that
                    for convenience. Foffer announced that he had
                    <a
                      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1f0hs79/you_can_train_handwriting_loras_with_flux/"
                      >replicated J.R.R. Tolkien's handwriting</a

                  <p>
                    [...] Foffer's breakthrough was realizing that Flux can be
                    customized using a special technique called "LoRA" (short
                    for "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685"
                      >low-rank adaptation</a
                    >") to imitate someone's handwriting in a very realistic
                    way. LoRA is a modular method of fine-tuning Flux to teach
                    it new concepts that weren't in its original training
                    dataset—the initial set of pictures and illustrations
                    <a href="https://blackforestlabs.ai/">its creator</a> used
                    to teach it how to synthesize images.

                    [...] "I don't want to encourage people to copy other's
                    handwriting, especially signatures," Foffer told me in an
                    interview the day he took the Tolkien model down. But said
                    he would help me attempt to apply his technique to a less
                    famous individual for an article, telling me how I could
                    inexpensively train

                    should try it. I think you'll be surprised how fun and easy
                    it is," he said.

                    That file triggers the execution of a base64 obfuscated

                    require the task to be completed quickly: five minutes for

                  <p>
                    Lucina Uddin, a professor of psychology at the University of
                    California, Los Angeles, is the named plaintiff in an
                    antitrust lawsuit against six publishers of academic
                    journals: Elsevier, Wolters Kluwer, Wiley, Sage, Taylor and
                    Francis Group, and Springer. The lawsuit accuses the
                    publishers of collusion in violation of Section 1 of the
                    Sherman Act, stating that they "conspired to unlawfully
                    appropriate billions of dollars that would have otherwise
                    funded scientific research."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The plaintiff "seeks to recover treble damages, an
                    injunction, and other relief."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in New York,
                    can be read in its entirety
                    <a

                      >here</a
                    >. The early paragraphs in which the publishers' "scheme" is
                    described are a good read:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        The Publisher Defendants' Scheme has three primary
                        components. First, the Publisher Defendants agreed to
                        not compensate scholars for their labor, in particular
                        not to pay for their peer review services (the "Unpaid
                        Peer Review Rule"). In other words, the Publisher
                        Defendants agreed to fix the price of peer review
                        services at zero. The Publisher Defendants also agreed
                        to coerce scholars into providing their labor for
                        nothing by expressly linking their unpaid labor with
                        their ability to get their manuscripts published in the
                        Publisher Defendants' journals. In the "publish or
                        perish" world of academia, the Publisher Defendants
                        essentially agreed to hold the careers of scholars
                        hostage so that the Publisher Defendants could force
                        them to provide their valuable labor for free.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Second, the Publisher Defendants agreed not to compete
                        with each other for manuscripts by requiring scholars to
                        submit their manuscripts to only one journal at a time
                        (the "Single Submission Rule"). The Single Submission
                        Rule substantially reduces competition among the
                        Publisher Defendants, substantially decreasing
                        incentives to review manuscripts promptly and publish
                        meritorious research quickly. The Single Submission Rule
                        also robs scholars of negotiating leverage they
                        otherwise would have had if more than one journal
                        offered to publish their manuscripts. Thus, the
                        Publisher Defendants know that if they offer to publish
                        a manuscript, the submitting scholar has no viable
                        alternative and the Publisher Defendant can then dictate
                        the terms of publication.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Third, the Publisher Defendants agreed to prohibit
                        scholars from freely sharing the scientific advancements
                        described in submitted manuscripts while those
                        manuscripts are under peer review, a process that often
                        takes over a year (the "Gag Rule"). From the moment
                        scholars submit manuscripts for publication, the
                        Publisher Defendants behave as though the scientific
                        advancements set forth in the manuscripts are their
                        property, to be shared only if the Publisher Defendants
                        grant permission. Moreover, when the Publisher
                        Defendants select manuscripts for publication, the
                        Publisher Defendants will often require scholars to sign
                        away all intellectual property rights, in exchange for
                        nothing. The manuscripts then become the actual property
                        of the Publisher Defendants, and the Publisher
                        Defendants charge the maximum the market will bear for
                        access to that scientific knowledge.
                      </p>

                    between 1994 and 2022, were included in the final analysis.
                    The main reason studies were excluded was that they were not
                    actually relevant; this is very normal with search results
                    from systematic reviews.

                    No association between mobile phone use and brain cancer, or
                    any other head or neck cancer, was found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There was also no association with cancer if a person used a
                    mobile phone for ten or more years (prolonged use). How
                    often they used it – either based on the number of calls or
                    the time spent on the phone – also didn't make a difference.

                    But many feel the plan focuses too much on untested tech and
                    not enough on circularity.

                    The UN global stocktake – which took place at

                    reductions targets.

                    last year, falling by 7pc according to the Sustainable
                    Energy Authority of Ireland. But this report also warned
                    that Ireland is highly reliant on both fossil fuels and
                    imported energy, and the country is still not on track to
                    remain within its 2021-2025 carbon budget.

                Five BlueBird satellites have launched as part of AST

                    Bad news for sky watchers: Earth's orbit has been littered
                    by five more gigantic satellites which are poised to become

                    commercial communications array to be deployed in low Earth
                    orbit, according to AST SpaceMobile. The company's prototype
                    satellite unfurled its giant array in late 2022,

                    [....] ST SpaceMobile isn't the only company trying to build
                    cellular towers in space. SpaceX has launched more than
                    7,000 satellites to date, and new batches of its Starlink
                    satellites keep making their way to low Earth orbit. Amazon,
                    OneWeb, and Lynk Global are other companies trying to get in

                    In the 20th century, nations built international
                    institutions to allow the spread of peaceful nuclear energy
                    but slow nuclear weapons proliferation by controlling access
                    to the raw materials—namely weapons-grade uranium and
                    plutonium—that underpins them. The risk has been managed
                    through international institutions, such as the
                    <a href="https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/atomic-energy"
                      >Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and International Atomic
                      Energy Agency</a
                    >. Today, 32 nations operate nuclear power plants, which
                    collectively provide 10% of the world's electricity, and
                    only nine countries possess nuclear weapons.

                  <p>
                    Countries can do something similar for AI today. They can
                    regulate AI from the ground up by controlling access to the
                    highly specialized chips that are needed to train the
                    world's most advanced AI models.

                    author – ecologist Katherine Turo from Rutgers University in
                    the US –

                    "If you look through a list of crops and think about which
                    fruits and vegetables you're most excited to eat – like
                    summer berries or apples and pumpkins in the fall – those
                    are the crops that typically need to be pollinated by
                    insects," Turo

                    And yet, there's a lack of experimental research on
                    pollinator limitation in crops. While we know the phenomenon
                    is impacting global food supplies, its prevalence has so far
                    been unclear.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Within this detailed picture, Turo and colleagues
                    found that up to 60 percent of global crop systems are being
                    limited by insufficient pollination. The phenomenon is
                    affecting 25 of the 49 different crop species analyzed, with
                    blueberry, coffee, and apple crops being the worst affected.

                  <p>
                    Pollinator limitation is occurring in 85 percent of the
                    countries in this database, spanning all six continents
                    represented.

                    "Our findings are a cause for concern and optimism," says
                    Turo.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We did detect widespread yield deficits. However, we also
                    estimate that, through continued investment in pollinator
                    management and research, it is likely that we can improve
                    the efficiency of our existing crop fields to meet the
                    nutritional needs of our global population."

                  <p>
                    [...] "Our findings show that by paying more attention to
                    pollinators, growers could make agricultural fields more
                    productive."

                    Curiosity is the driving force behind all science, which may
                    explain why so many scientists sometimes find themselves
                    going in some decidedly eccentric research directions. Did
                    you hear about the WWII plan to train pigeons as missile
                    guidance systems? How about experiments on the swimming
                    ability of a dead rainbow trout or that time biologists
                    tried to startle cows by popping paper bags by their heads?
                    These and other unusual research endeavors were honored
                    tonight in a virtual ceremony to announce the 2024
                    recipients of the annual Ig Nobel Prizes. Yes, it's that
                    time of year again, when the serious and the silly
                    converge—for science.

                    The US government has noticed the potentially negative

                    on areas like journalism and content creation. Senator Amy
                    Klobuchar, along with seven Democrat colleagues, urged the
                    Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Justice Department to
                    probe generative AI products like ChatGPT for potential
                    antitrust violations, they wrote in a

                      href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=E65C9B3F-1EDC-4059-ADEB-F67CF37F259D"

                    "Recently, multiple dominant online platforms have
                    introduced new generative AI features that answer user
                    queries by summarizing, or, in some cases, merely
                    regurgitating online content from other sources or
                    platforms," the letter states. "The introduction of these
                    new generative AI features further threatens the ability of
                    journalists and other content creators to earn compensation
                    for their vital work."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawmakers went on to note that traditional search
                    results lead users to publishers' websites while
                    AI-generated summaries keep the users on the search platform
                    "where that platform alone can profit from the user's
                    attention through advertising and data collection."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These products also have significant competitive
                    consequences that distort markets for content. When a
                    generative AI feature answers a query directly, it often
                    forces the content creator—whose content has been relegated
                    to a lower position on the user interface—to compete with
                    content generated from their own work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fact that AI may be scraping news sites and then not
                    even directing users to the original source could be a form
                    of "exclusionary conduct or an unfair method of competition
                    in violation of antitrust laws," the lawmakers concluded.

                    Softguard Systems was founded by Joseph Diodati, Paul Sachse
                    and Ken Williams in 1983¹. The company went public in 1984,
                    and by 1985 was one of the industry leaders in copy
                    protection technology, although they produced a few other
                    unrelated products as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Advertisements for their copy-protection product, SUPERLoK,
                    were commonly seen in the classified sections of
                    publications such as InfoWorld and PC Magazine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The original Superlok product required professional disk
                    duplication to lay down the requisite copy protection track.
                    Eventually, Softguard would produce the "SUPERLoK KIT,"
                    which was writable with a standard PC floppy controller. An
                    advertisement for the Kit can be seen above, left. The Kit
                    version was aimed at smaller developers on a budget, and did
                    not offer the same level of protection. This article will
                    focus on the original Superlok product.

                    [...] What they had come up with was an AI that can analyse
                    how sound bounces around a room before reaching the
                    microphone or ear.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We catch the sound as it arrives at each microphone,
                    backtrack to figure out where it came from, and then, in
                    essence, we suppress any sound that couldn't have come from
                    where the person is sitting," says Mr McElveen.

                  <p>
                    The effect is comparable in certain respects to when a
                    camera focusses on one subject and blurs out the foreground
                    and background.
                  </p>

                    "The results don't sound crystal clear when you can only use
                    a very noisy recording to learn from, but they're still
                    stunning."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The technology had its first real-world forensic use in a US
                    murder case, where the evidence it was able to provide
                    proved central to the convictions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since then, other government laboratories, including
                    in the UK, have put it through a battery of tests. The
                    company is now marketing the technology to the US military,
                    which has used it to analyse sonar signals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Eventually it aims to introduce tailored versions of
                    its product for use in audio recording kit, voice interfaces
                    for cars, smart speakers, augmented and virtual reality,
                    sonar and hearing aid devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, for example, if you speak to your car or smart speaker
                    it wouldn't matter if there was a lot of noise going on
                    around you, the device would still be able to make out what
                    you were saying.

                  <p>
                    [...] "The math in all our tests shows remarkable
                    similarities with human hearing. There's little oddities
                    about what our algorithm can do, and how accurately it can
                    do it, that are astonishingly similar to some of the
                    oddities that exist in human hearing," says McElveen.

                    - that in solving the cocktail party problem, we may have

                    One port that’s not nearly as popular or playable as the
                    others is the Sega Saturn port that came out nearly four
                    years after the game’s release.

                    called the Sega Saturn <em>Doom </em>port just about
                    everything you can call a bad game without straying over the
                    the boundaries of good taste: “completely worthless,”
                    “drab,” “jerky,” “to be avoided at all costs.”

                  <p>
                    Bo, a self-described reverse engineer of Sega Saturn games,
                    gave the Sega Saturn port of <em>Doom </em>another chance
                    and he discovered a cheat code in the game that’s been
                    laying dormant for more than a decade. He posted

                    The button combination X, Right, B, Y, X, Right, B, Y gives
                    you the ability to see through the walls of the Mars
                    substation and even Hell. It’s too bad the game doesn’t have
                    a cheat code that lets you see a better version of
                    <em>Doom</em>.

                    One of the things enterprise storage and destruction company
                    Iron Mountain does is handle the archiving of the media
                    industry's vaults. What it has been seeing lately should be
                    a wake-up call: roughly one-fifth of the hard disk drives

                    media rots, magnetic media rots and loses magnetic charge,

                    The study also identified stretches of DNA in the ancient
                    Rapa Nui genomes that have an Indigenous American origin.
                    Their analysis suggests that the mixing of these populations
                    occurred around the 1300s.

                    “Our interpretation is that the ancestors of Rapa Nui first

                    ticketing and pricing entirely to their promoters and
                    management, and at no time had any awareness that dynamic
                    pricing was going to be used," said the statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It said that "meetings between promoters, Ticketmaster and
                    the band's management" had resulted in an agreement to use
                    dynamic pricing "to help keep general ticket prices down as
                    well as reduce touting".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, "the execution of the plan failed to meet
                    expectations".

                    The RX 7800M is a powerful mobile GPU for gaming notebooks.

                  <p>
                    AMD has officially debuted its sixth discrete GPU in its
                    mobile RX 7000 lineup, the
                    <a

                      >RX 7800M</a
                    >. The new GPU is AMD's second mobile RDNA 3 GPU to arrive
                    with a chipset-style architecture and is the runner-up to
                    the flagship RX 7900M.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The RX 7800M is armed with 60 RDNA 3 compute units, 96 ROPS,
                    3,840 stream processors, 48MB of Infinity Cache, and a game
                    clock of 2,145MHz. Bus width was not mentioned, but we
                    suspect it is using a 192-bit interface. Memory bandwidth is
                    rated at up to 432GB/s, memory capacity is 12GB, and GDDR6
                    ICs operate at up to 18 Gbps. GPU power consumption is rated
                    at up to 180W.

                    that the RX 7800M performs very similarly to AMD’s desktop

                    >. This is unsurprising since both GPUs share the same
                    memory configuration, and the GPU’s superior core count
                    configuration offsets the 7700 XT’s low power/clock speed.
                    Compared to Nvidia, the RX 7800M performs faster than its
                    RTX 4070 laptop GPU but is slower than its RTX 4080 mobile
                    counterpart. Performance was also a touch behind Nvidia’s

                    the additional 26 trillion MBs used last year is a 36
                    percent increase over 2022 and is the largest single-year
                    increase in wireless data ever. It is also enough data for
                    every household in the country to watch the first season of

                    The continued proliferation of 5G networks is helping to
                    drive growth as well. The CTIA said that by the end of 2023,
                    nearly 40 percent of all wireless connections – including
                    smartphones, IoT devices, and wearables – were 5G and that
                    more than 330 million Americans were covered by at least one
                    5G network. The total number of wireless connections reached
                    558 million, or more than 1.6 connections for each American.

                    is only expected to increase in the coming years as network
                    operators pump even more money into the system. The industry
                    collectively invested $30 billion in 2023 to improve their
                    networks, pushing the total US wireless industry spend to
                    more than $700 billion to date ($190 billion of which has
                    come since 2018). A total of 432,469 cell sites were in
                    operation across the country at the end of 2023, an increase
                    of 24 percent since 2018.

                    Wireless data is also more affordable now than it ever has
                    been. The cost per MB has dropped 50 percent since 2020 and
                    97 percent versus a decade ago, down to just $.002 per MB.

                    And then there is Amazon Linux 2, a Linux operating system
                    from Microsoft's arch-cloud rival AWS, which is provided
                    free of additional charge and described as a
                    "security-focused, stable, and high-performance execution
                    environment to develop and run cloud applications." AWS also
                    provides ongoing security and maintenance updates.
                  </p>
                  <p>If only Microsoft had something similar.</p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft's social-media-for-suits platform LinkedIn
                    recently
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/28/linkedin_azure_linux/"

                    from CentOS to Azure Linux. The experience was doubtless a
                    challenge, but, as we noted then: "This can only be good for
                    Azure Linux, and indeed, for Azure in general."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Does the future of Azure Linux lie somewhere other than a
                    relatively obscure way to host containers on AKS? Foley
                    asked Microsoft and was told: "Azure Linux for VM or bare
                    metal use is not available as a commercially supported
                    offering today. Support is limited to AKS as the host OS."
                  </p>
                  <p>Note the word "today" in that response.</p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft is unlikely to make much money directly from Azure
                    Linux going wide. However, it would be a useful driver to
                    the company's Azure cloud platform and soothe concerns over
                    support and maintenance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, for many administrators, an attitude of "Anything
                    but Microsoft" persists, certainly since
                    <a

                    bonkers "Linux is a cancer" comment. Persuading these same
                    admins that Microsoft can be a trustworthy Linux partner is
                    a challenge that should not be underestimated. ®

                    "Even a pure 'transparency' measure, if it compels
                    non-commercial speech, is subject to strict scrutiny," Smith
                    wrote, concluding that X would likely suffer irreparable
                    harm if key parts of the law weren't blocked.<br />[...]<br />Smith
                    ordered the case to be remanded to the district court "with
                    instructions to enter a preliminary injunction consistent
                    with the opinion." The district court will also have to
                    determine if unconstitutional parts of the law "are
                    severable from the remainder of AB 587 and, if so, which, if
                    any, of the remaining challenged provisions should also be
                    enjoined."

                  <p>
                    This is the outcome that the state had asked for if the
                    appeals court sided with X, giving California a fighting
                    chance to preserve some parts of the law. But if the
                    district court decides to strike the entire content
                    moderation report section from the law, AB 587 would be
                    properly gutted—basically only requiring social media
                    companies to post their terms of service on a government
                    website. That's the only part of the law that X did not
                    fight to enjoin on appeal.
