              </p>
              <p>
                Hackers have been exploiting a critical vulnerability in a
                popular WordPress plugin called 'Loginizer' that allows them to
                take full control of affected sites. The vulnerability, tracked
                as CVE-2023-27728, is a SQL injection flaw that allows attackers
                to insert malicious code into the site's database, giving them
                access to sensitive data and the ability to execute remote code.
                Loginizer is installed on millions of WordPress sites, and the
                vulnerability affects all versions up to and including 1.6.5.
                The plugin is designed to provide security features such as
                two-factor authentication and brute-force protection.
              </p>
              <p>
                Security researchers have identified multiple hacking groups
                actively exploiting the vulnerability in recent weeks. The
                attackers are scanning the internet for WordPress sites that
                have the vulnerable plugin installed and are using automated
                tools to inject malicious code into the site's database. Once a
                site is compromised, the attackers can use it for various
                malicious purposes, such as stealing user data or distributing
                malware.
              </p>
              <p>
                The plugin's developers have released a patch for the
                vulnerability, and WordPress site owners are advised to update
                their installations immediately. However, given the widespread
                use of the plugin, it is likely that many sites remain
                vulnerable to exploitation. Loginizer is just one of many
                WordPress plugins that have been found to have security flaws in
                recent years, highlighting the importance of regular security
                updates and monitoring for site owners.

                The keynote speakers were Arun Gupta, Dr. Kitty Yeung, and Ken
                Thompson. There were nearly 100 sessions covering everything
                from open government to embedded, security, and FOSS@HOME to
                name only a few. Ceph, DevOps LA, Kubernetes and PostgreSQL also
                had presences at the event. Ken Thompson's keynote covered
                several topics including a long running project of his regarding
                music playback, which now includes a Raspberry Pi powered
                jukebox with tens of thousands of albums available. For the

                    lunar science and exploration missions, including NASA's
                    crewed Artemis moon landings," said Crescent CEO Joe Landon.
                    Before being tapped to lead Crescent, Landon was Lockheed
                    Martin's VP and GM for lunar infrastructure services. Being
                    well positioned, we note, does not mean the company will

                    Crescent said it plans to launch the first satellites of the
                    Parsec constellation in 2025, with will add more nodes over
                    time. We asked Lockheed Martin if it or Crescent had been in
                    talks with NASA to make a parsec into more than just a
                    measure of space smuggling efficiency, and a Lockheed Martin
                    spokesperson told us the company isn't under contract right
                    now.

                    "Lockheed Martin believes so strongly in the future of the
                    lunar economy that we have invested our own money in
                    developing the first two Parsec satellites needed for
                    Crescent's fundamental lunar communications and navigation

                  <p>
                    Lockheed Martin said Parsec spacecraft are funded and in
                    development, and reiterated that the company is still
                    operating with a baseline launch date of 2025.

                    chemistry and music to create what he calls a new

                    the American Chemical Society being held this week in
                    Indianapolis, Indiana. Smith even featured audio clips of
                    some of the elements, along with "compositions" featuring
                    larger molecules, during a performance of his "The Sound of

                    built a library of the "sounds" of a top quark jet and the
                    Higgs boson, among others. The project hoped to develop
                    sonification as a technique for analyzing the data from
                    particle collisions so that physicists could "detect"
                    subatomic particles by ear.

                    involving Nishimura, Good Smile, and Tokyo-based
                    telecommunications firm Dwango. The three parties, the
                    document said, were in talks to acquire 4chan. In December,
                    The New York Times confirmed that Nishimura purchased 4chan
                    with funding from

                    When asked about Good Smile's involvement in 4chan last
                    December in an interview with publisher Shueisha, Nishimura

                    >. He and Good Smile's president, Takanori Aki, had met at
                    an anime convention and become friends, Nishimura said.
                    "However, Good Smile Company is in the process of leaving."

                    Good Smile did not respond to WIRED's request for

                    >, in addition to other types of hate. Given 4chan's rampant
                    hate speech, it's a move that could hit them particularly
                    hard. But any action against 4chan requires, or is at least
                    enormously helped by, knowing who actually owns and runs the
                    site. Now that 4chan's ownership and funding is in the
                    public record, the temperature may start to increase on
                    Nishimura.

                    "I think Mr. Kawakami's description of Mr. Nishimura is fair
                    and quite accurate," Sei says. "Kawakami described Nishimura
                    as a child who tears the legs off from a bug. And that he
                    enjoys that."

                is somewhat comparable to the Cabinet. Headed by the Prime
                Minister and consisting of the heads of the various Ministries
                (Defense, Commerce, Education, Agriculture and Rural Affairs,
                Justice, Civil Affairs, State Security, Public Security and so

                Its operational procedures are described in a document,
                conveniently titled "Working Procedures for the State Council".
                On March 18, an updated version of that document was published,

                  actions"</i

                Thought, the thought of Deng Xiaoping and the ideologies of

                    A federal judge yesterday ruled that Google intentionally
                    destroyed evidence and must be sanctioned, rejecting the
                    company's argument that it didn't need to automatically
                    preserve internal chats involving employees subject to a
                    legal hold.

                    "After substantial briefing by both sides, and an
                    evidentiary hearing that featured witness testimony and
                    other evidence, the Court concludes that sanctions are
                    warranted," US District Judge James Donato wrote. Later in
                    the ruling, he wrote that evidence shows that "Google
                    intended to subvert the discovery process, and that Chat
                    evidence was 'lost with the intent to prevent its use in
                    litigation' and 'with the intent to deprive another party of
                    the information's use in the litigation.'"<br />[...]<br />After

                    AI image generator Midjourney has halted free trials of its
                    service, blaming a sudden influx of new users. Midjourney
                    CEO and founder David Holz announced the change on Tuesday,
                    originally
                    <a
                      href="https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/942231458918064148/1090207233113075732"

                    >
                    "extraordinary demand and trial abuse" in a message on
                    Discord (this announcement was
                    <a
                      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/30/midjourney-ai-image-generation-rules/"
                      >spotted first by <em>The Washington Post</em></a
                    >). In an email to The Verge, Holz stated that the pause is
                    "because of massive amounts of people making throwaway
                    accounts to get free images."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We think the culprit was probably a viral how-to video in
                    china," said Holz over email. "This happened at the same
                    time as a temporary gpu shortage. The two things came
                    together and it was bringing down the service for paid
                    users."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Given Holz's reference to "abuse," it was originally thought
                    that the pause was linked to a spate of recent viral images
                    created using Midjourney, including fabricated
                    <a

                      >pope wearing a stylish jacket</a
                    >, which some mistook for real photographs. However, Holz
                    characterized earlier reports as a "misunderstanding" and
                    notes that the free trial of Midjourney never included
                    access to the latest version of Midjourney,
                    <a href="https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/model-versions"
                      >version 5</a
                    >, that creates the most realistic images and which is
                    thought to have been used for these viral pictures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Midjourney maintains a list of banned words "related
                    to topics in different countries based on complaints from
                    users in those countries," as
                    <a
                      href="https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/989270517401911316/1028855696084697099"
                      >per a message from Holz last October</a
                    >. But it doesn't share a complete version of this list to
                    minimize "drama." As Holz said last year, "Almost no one
                    ever notices [the ban list] unless they're specially trying
                    to create drama which is against our rules in tos [terms of
                    service] 'don't use our tools to create drama.'"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] At the time of writing, Midjourney is still not
                    allowing free users to generate images, though this may
                    change in the future. "We're still trying to figure out how
                    to bring free trials back, we tried to require an active
                    email but that wasn't enough so we're back to the drawing
                    board," said Holz.

                    [...] In a climate where industries are bickering about who
                    is and isn't allowed to create nitrogen emissions, farmers
                    groups argue that priority should be given to the farmers,
                    whose operations they say were made illegal overnight by a
                    2019 change in nitrogen rules. "Only after these
                    agricultural entrepreneurs are legalized can they use
                    freed-up nitrogen space for the construction of data centers
                    or anything else for that matter," says Job Knobbout,
                    spokesperson for the Netherlands Agricultural and
                    Horticultural Association (LTO).

                    Opposition to datacenter development is growing, in the
                    Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. When Meta proposed
                    building the Netherlands' biggest data center yet in the
                    municipality of Zeewolde, locals <a
                      href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-dutch-data-center/"
                      >rallied against the project</a
                    >
                    until the whole plan was called off. Farmers were
                    influential in this debate as well. "With Zeewolde, in
                    particular, the data center would have taken away land that
                    was actually being rented out by the government to farmers,
                    to give that to a multinational company," says Karin van Es,
                    associate professor of media studies at Utrecht University,
                    who has studied the data center debate. "So that created a
                    lot of tension."

                    [...] Ruiter says he's continued to talk about data centers
                    because he wants to remind people that "the cloud" they've
                    come to rely on isn't just an ethereal concept—it's
                    something that has a physical manifestation, here in the
                    farmland of North Holland. He worries that growing demand
                    for data storage from people, and <a

                    "Of course, we need some data centers," he says. But he
                    wants us to talk about restructuring the way the internet
                    works so they are not so necessary. "We should be having the
                    philosophical debate of what do we do with all our data? I
                    don't think we need to store everything online in a central
                    place."

                    German company Isar Aerospace has raised $165 million in
                    order to ramp up the development of its Spectrum rocket,
                    which is scheduled for its debut launch later this year. For
                    Europeans needing access to space, the rocket's arrival will
                    come not a moment too soon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Isar Aerospace has raised a total of $330 million so
                    far, with $75 million raised during its previous round of
                    funding in July 2021. The funds will go towards the
                    development of Isar's Spectrum rocket, a two-stage launch
                    vehicle designed to carry small and medium sized satellites
                    to orbit. According to ISAR, Spectrum should be capable of
                    carrying 2,205 pounds (1,000 kilograms) to low Earth orbit
                    (LEO). By comparison, SpaceX's medium-lift Falcon 9 can
                    hoist 50,265 pounds (22,800 kg) to LEO.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Spectrum's inaugural launch is planned for the second half
                    of 2023. Isar Aerospace is currently running tests on the
                    rocket's Aquila engine, which was developed and manufactured
                    in-house. The company is also finalizing its infrastructure
                    at the launch site in Andøya, Norway, which will host
                    Spectrum's debut liftoff.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Europe is desperately in need of its own launch
                    vehicles, whether for small or medium lift, to provide local
                    access to space. Spectrum won't be the most powerful rocket
                    when it debuts, but it'll fill a troublesome gap, especially
                    until Vega-C and Ariane 6 come through.

                    The team used gravitational lensing to see the black hole.

                    fields bend photons of light magnifying and warping
                    them—making it possible to see object that would otherwise

                    inactive black holes, something not currently possible in
                    distant galaxies," Nightingale added. "This approach could
                    let us detect many more black holes beyond our local
                    universe and reveal how these exotic objects evolved further
                    back in cosmic time."

                    [...] It's not nearly as robust a service as Xbox Game Pass
                    or even competitor Amazon's Luna, but the library's breadth
                    and quality is roughly on par with Apple Arcade and is
                    admittedly a nice bonus on top of your subscription that's
                    easy to miss, if a confusing direction for the company—we're
                    not sure anybody should subscribe to Netflix for the games,
                    at least right now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By putting its games on TVs, Netflix could boost their
                    discoverability and maybe make its gaming branch more of a
                    legitimate selling point. The code's reference to using a
                    phone as a controller does imply that the move would still
                    be limited to Netflix's current mobile game lineup, which
                    would still leave it behind more robust console selections
                    from competing game services, but would also keep the
                    service lightweight and allow it to be played across more
                    platforms, as it does not currently rely on streaming from
                    the cloud. We are curious, though, if Netflix will allow for
                    more traditional controllers in games that support them.

                    "Since aspirin is a COX inhibitor, this suggests potential
                    interplay between COX and IDO1 during inflammation," Mandel
                    said.

                  <p>
                    This interplay could be important for treating other kinds
                    of illness beyond the typical indications for aspirin, the
                    researchers say. They note that some immunotherapy
                    treatments, which try to strengthen the immune system's
                    response to cancer, also target IDO1. So it's possible that
                    future COX/IDO1 inhibitors might be feasible as
                    immunotherapy drugs.

                    This sort of basic research is crucial for drug development,
                    but it's still the very beginning of the road. Mandel and
                    his team say that they're now trying to create small
                    molecules in the lab that similarly inhibit COX/IDO1, which
                    they will test out as potential anti-inflammatory and
                    immunotherapy drugs.

                    We should conclude that organizational security must not
                    rely heavily on securing the user, that they will be
                    compromised, and then begin securing systems with this
                    assumption in mind. Thus, even if an end user is breached,
                    the amount of systemic damage that's done by that compromise
                    shouldn't be large if proper security measures are employed
                    and orchestrated correctly.

                    [...] Getting a DMCA subpoena doesn't seem to be all that
                    difficult if it pertains to someone who directly posted

                    [PDF] says that if a notification of infringement satisfies
                    the provisions of the law, and if "the proposed subpoena is
                    in proper form, and the accompanying declaration is properly
                    executed, the clerk shall expeditiously issue and sign the
                    proposed subpoena and return it to the requester for

                    GitHub could theoretically still challenge the subpoena
                    demands. "While DMCA subpoenas are meant to provide a legal
                    fast lane to reveal the identity of an alleged infringer,
                    platforms receiving a subpoena can challenge it in court,

                    As Apple's major chip manufacturer TSMC nears the opening of
                    its Arizona plant, US officials want it to build more — but
                    US versus China politics are complicating matters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Taiwanese company TSMC has already invested

                      >in 2024</a
                    >. But since the US does not have a income tax agreement
                    with Taiwan, TSMC faces double taxation on its profits from
                    this or any other factory it could build in the States.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the <em>Financial Times</em>, unless there is a
                    change in the law, TSMC will be
                    <a
                      href="https://www.ft.com/content/743a9cfa-c6a1-4f89-8c24-8607414e6900"

                    over 50% of its profits earned in the US. In comparison,
                    Samsung pays much less because its home country of South
                    Korea has a tax treaty with the States.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Naturally, then, US politicians who want to see the firm
                    expand in the States argue that President Biden should
                    negotiate a tax accord with Taiwan. TSMC officials have
                    reportedly also asked for such an agreement to ease this
                    double taxation burden.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, at present the US does not recognize Taiwan as a
                    separate country or sovereign nation. Instead, it sees it as
                    part of China.

                    Furthermore, the report speculates that such energy could be
                    "propagated with low loss through air for tens to hundreds
                    of meters, and with some loss, through most building
                    materials." This could potentially be done using "commercial
                    off-the-shelf technology" and devices exist that "are easily
                    portable and concealable, and can be powered by standard
                    electricity or batteries," it states.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The report is really interesting but it's also [sort of]
                    funny because it appears to say the exact opposite of what
                    the government just came out and told everybody less than a
                    month ago. On March 1st, Haines told journalists that most
                    cases of Havana Syndrome could likely be attributed to
                    "environmental factors" or "conventional illnesses." The
                    notion that the symptoms would've been caused by a "directed
                    energy weapon" was considered "highly unlikely" in most
                    instances, Haines told the public. While she and other
                    officials left the door open for alternative explanations,
                    the press conference seemed like a clear attempt to shut
                    down further speculation about the bizarre episodes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But far from waving off victims' symptoms as the result of
                    "environmental factors" or some sort of mass delusion, the
                    recently declassified report refers to Havana Syndrome as a
                    "unique neurosensory syndrome" that is "distinctly unusual,"
                    and is "unreported elsewhere in the medical literature."
                    Aside from the "electromagnetic energy" explanation, it also
                    seems to dismiss most of the other theories that have been
                    posited to explain the syndrome's genesis."

                    Despite production cuts already in effect, PC makers still
                    have between 9 and 13 weeks of DRAM inventory. The mobile
                    sector seems to be having healthier levels of inventory as
                    mobile manufacturers were more conservative in their plans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nonetheless, mobile DRAM pricing is also expected to decline
                    by 10 to 15%. As consumer demand for DRAM was sluggish,
                    suppliers looked to the server side of the business for
                    sales, however this simply resulted in a huge pile-up of
                    inventory for server DRAM.

                    are being sought as a climate solution because they have a
                    smaller carbon footprints than conventional fossil fuels
                    used to power planes. They are made from materials including
                    waste cooking oils, woody debris, manure, algae and crops.

                    One of sustainable aviation fuel's biggest selling points is
                    the fuel can replace jet fuel in existing aircraft, making
                    it a quicker way to cut carbon emissions from flights. Other
                    clean aviation strategies such as electric- or
                    hydrogen-powered aircraft are still being developed and
                    approved by regulators, and the aircraft in the works are
                    smaller planes — not transcontinental jets.

                    Blanchard says the team was conducting standard experiments
                    designed to better understand the basic properties of
                    liquid-state salts (also known as ionic liquids). The team
                    found that two different room-temperature ionic liquids each
                    generated electricity when a piston squeezed them within a
                    cylinder. The strength of the effect the researchers
                    observed was directly proportional to the force applied.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It shocked the hell out of us to see that," Blanchard says.
                    "Nobody had ever seen the piezoelectric effect in liquids
                    before."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Blanchard and his colleagues found that the optical
                    properties of these ionic liquids could alter dramatically
                    in response to electric current. For instance, when the
                    researchers placed these fluids in a lens-shaped container,
                    they found that an electric charge could modify how much the
                    liquids bent light, "changing the focal length of the lens,"
                    Blanchard says.

                    Nokia, NASA, SpaceX, and others. The company Intuitive
                    Machines’s upcoming IM-2 mission, currently scheduled to
                    launch in November aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, will

                  <p>
                    Once delivered, Intuitive Machines' Nova-C lunar lander will
                    be able to have an active connection with its Rovers,
                    helping aid in lunar discoveries, not to mention developing
                    a human presence on the surface of the moon.

                  <p>
                    [...] Last November, however, Chapek was unceremoniously
                    dismissed from Disney. And Bob Iger returned to the CEO
                    role, quickly

                    The metaverse ambitions appear to be the latest to be
                    targeted by Iger. Despite the many ideas that were publicly
                    floated, the metaverse unit had apparently not made much
                    progress on the new technology and did not have many clear
                    plans in place.

                    The computer scientist sat down with CBS News this week
                    about his predictions for the advancement of AI. He compared
                    the invention of AI to electricity or the wheel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hinton, who works at Google and the University of Toronto,
                    said that the development of general purpose AI is
                    progressing sooner than people may imagine. General purpose
                    AI is artificial intelligence with several intended and
                    unintended purposes, including speech recognition, answering
                    questions and translation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Until quite recently, I thought it was going to be like 20
                    to 50 years before we have general purpose AI. And now I
                    think it may be 20 years or less," Hinton predicted. Asked
                    specifically the chances of AI "wiping out humanity," Hinton
                    said, "I think it's not inconceivable. That's all I'll say."

                  <p>
                    [...] Hinton said it was plausible for computers to
                    eventually gain the ability to create ideas to improve
                    themselves.

                    [...] The Webb is so sensitive that it enabled an entirely
                    different sort of observation. Most attempts at imaging
                    exoplanet atmospheres rely on light from the host star that
                    grazes the planets, and thus would pass through any
                    atmosphere that's there. This relies on the planet passing
                    in front of the host star.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This new work relies on the planet passing
                    <em>behind</em> the host star—having the star eclipse the
                    planet, in other words. Shortly before and after that
                    happens, the telescope will receive light from both the star
                    itself and any light that's emitted or reflected by the
                    planet. This sort of "secondary eclipse" is difficult to
                    detect, given that the star is so much brighter. In
                    addition, the Webb's detectors are sensitive to wavelengths
                    that would allow it to detect any carbon dioxide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This initial work focused on the innermost planet,
                    TRAPPIST-1b, where the star would be roughly 1,000 times
                    brighter than any light we should see from the planet. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The work used the drop in light caused by the secondary
                    eclipse to infer what portion of the light outside the
                    eclipse was coming from the planet. This light would be a
                    mix of reflected light and heat given off the planet, which
                    is baked by roughly four times the radiation that Earth
                    receives from the Sun. But, by imaging in the infrared, most
                    of what's being detected is primarily the heat radiated off
                    the planet. By assuming this is approximately a
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation"
                      >black body radiation</a
                    >, it's possible to estimate the temperature of the planet
                    needed to produce that radiation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This produced a result of about 500 K, or 230° C, which
                    tells us there's probably no atmosphere.

                    While the web-tracking pixels ostensibly aim to better
                    pinpoint advertising, they also pose threats for privacy,
                    security experts have said. They can sometimes be configured
                    to collect data that users enter on websites, such as
                    usernames, addresses and other sensitive information. With
                    enough pixels on enough websites, the companies running them
                    can begin to piece together the browsing behavior of
                    individual users as they move from domain to domain,
                    building detailed profiles on their interests and online
                    habits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Beyond TikTok, Feroot also found tracking pixels from
                    Chinese-owned companies such as Tencent Holdings Ltd., which
                    owns WeChat, Weibo Corp., and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. on
                    some state-government websites, as well as Russian-owned
                    pixels from companies such as from cybersecurity company
                    Kaspersky, which had its products banned from civilian and
                    military federal U.S. networks during the Trump
                    administration due to espionage fears.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Feroot found that the average website it studied had
                    more than 13 embedded pixels. Google's were far and away the
                    most common, with 92% of websites examined having some sort
                    of Google tracking pixel embedded. About 50% of the websites
                    the firm examined had Microsoft Corp. or Facebook pixels.
                    TikTok had a presence in less than 10% of sites examined.

                    Privacy advocates have long raised concerns about the
                    proliferation of pixels, whatever their provenance. Alan
                    Butler, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy
                    Information Center, said the data can be used to identify
                    individuals, track them physically and digitally, and
                    subject them to common cybersecurity threats, such as
                    phishing attempts and disinformation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Any social media platform, data broker, or ad service that
                    is using tracking pixels to monitor people's browsing across
                    the web is violating the privacy of users visiting those
                    websites," Mr. Butler said. "This is especially troubling on
                    government websites where individuals are being tracked even
                    as they try to access information and services that are
                    essential."

                    offering free polio boosters at walk-in clinics, working
                    with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to audit
                    vaccination coverage at day cares and schools, and trying to

                    Neurotechnologies today—devices that can measure and
                    influence our brains and nervous systems—are growing in
                    power and popularity. The neurotech marketplace, according
                    to Precedence Research, is worth USD $14.3 billion this year
                    and will exceed $20 billion within four years. Noninvasive
                    brain-computer interfaces, brain stimulation devices, and
                    brain-monitoring hardware (measuring alertness and attention
                    at work, for example) are no longer just laboratory
                    experiments and technological curios. The societal and legal
                    implications of widespread neurotech adoption may be
                    substantial.

                  <p>
                    Nita Farahany, professor of law and philosophy at Duke
                    University, has written a new book, [...] which explores how
                    our lives may be impacted by the use of brain-computer
                    interfaces and neural monitoring devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Farahany argues that the development and use of neurotech
                    presents a challenge to our current understanding of human
                    rights. Devices designed to measure, record and influence
                    our mental processes, used by us or on us, may infringe on
                    our rights to mental privacy, freedom of thought, and mental
                    self-determination. She calls this collection of freedoms
                    the right to cognitive liberty. Spectrum spoke with Farahany
                    recently about the future and present of neurotech and how
                    to weigh its promises—enhanced capabilities, for instance,
                    including bionics and prosthetics and even a third
                    arm—against its potential to interfere with people's mental
                    sovereignty.

                    If you don't believe the rushed launch of AI chatbots by Big
                    Tech has an extremely strong chance of degrading the web's
                    information ecosystem, consider the following:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Right now,* if you ask Microsoft's Bing chatbot if Google's
                    Bard chatbot has been shut down, it says yes, citing as
                    evidence

                    from Hacker News in which someone <em>joked</em> about this
                    happening, and someone else used ChatGPT to write fake news
                    coverage about the event.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (*I say "right now" because in the time between starting and
                    finishing writing this story, Bing changed its answer and
                    now correctly replies that Bard is still live. You can
                    interpret this as showing that these systems are, at least,
                    fixable <em>or</em> that they are so infinitely malleable
                    that it's impossible to even consistently report their
                    mistakes.)

                    What we have here is an early sign we're stumbling into a
                    massive game of AI misinformation telephone, in which
                    chatbots are unable to gauge reliable news sources, misread
                    stories about themselves, and misreport on their own
                    capabilities. In this case, the whole thing started because
                    of a single joke comment on Hacker News. Imagine what you
                    could do if you <em>wanted</em> these systems to fail.

                    It's a laughable situation but one with potentially serious
                    consequences. Given the inability of AI language models to
                    reliably sort fact from fiction, their launch online
                    threatens to unleash a rotten trail of misinformation and
                    mistrust across the web, a miasma that is impossible to map
                    completely or debunk authoritatively. All because Microsoft,
                    Google, and OpenAI have decided that market share is more
                    important than safety.

                    Are you among the few people still using Windows 7, 8, or
                    8.1 and playing games via Steam? If so, you might want to
                    upgrade to a newer version of Microsoft's OS before January
                    1, 2024, as that's the date Valve is terminating Steam
                    support for those older operating systems.

                  <p>
                    Valve made the surprise announcement in a Steam support

                      >post</a
                    >. It writes that as of January 1, 2024, Steam will
                    officially stop supporting the Windows 7, Windows 8, and
                    Windows 8.1 operating systems. After that date, the Steam
                    Client will no longer run on those versions of Windows. In
                    order to continue running Steam and any games or other
                    products purchased through Steam, users will need to update
                    to a more recent version of Windows. Or they could always
                    switch to Linux.

                  <p>
                    Valve's reasoning for dropping Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 is due
                    to Steam relying on an embedded version of Google Chrome,
                    which no longer functions on older versions of Windows. The
                    company adds that future versions of Steam will require
                    Windows feature and security updates only present in Windows
                    10 and above.

                    upgrading in the next nine months. The survey results show
                    that 1.43% of participants still use Windows 7 64-bit, while

                    Queensland which worked with Vow in this project, suggested

                    would react when we eat it. But if we did it again, we could

                    The new regulation allows the government to ban a particular
                    vendor's spyware from being used by agencies, if the
                    company's product is found to have contributed to human
                    rights violations, has been used to target U.S. citizens, or
                    has been wielded against activists or journalists. In
                    essence, the government is using its presence as a major
                    consumer of defense and security products as a cudgel to
                    encourage surveillance firms to behave or face blacklisting.

                    The announcement comes amidst revelations that more U.S.
                    officials have been targeted by spyware than previously
                    believed. On the same day that the executive order was
                    announced, a senior US administration staffer told reporters
                    that as many as 50 American officials are suspected or
                    confirmed to have been targeted by commercial spyware in
                    recent years. Previous reporting on this subject has focused
                    on a handful of diplomats in foreign countries who had
                    allegedly been targeted for surveillance. The new tally
                    shows that, in reality, the imprint of foreign campaigns
                    aimed at U.S. officials may be much broader.

                    "Commercial spyware – sophisticated and invasive cyber
                    surveillance tools sold by vendors to access electronic
                    devices remotely, extract their content, and manipulate
                    their components, all without the knowledge or consent of
                    the devices' users – has proliferated in recent years with
                    few controls and high risk of abuse," the White House's
                    announcement reads. "The proliferation of commercial spyware
                    poses distinct and growing counterintelligence and security
                    risks to the United States, including to the safety and

                    AI assistant. The plugins give ChatGPT the ability to
                    interact with the wider world through the Internet,
                    including booking flights, ordering groceries, browsing the
                    web, and more. Plugins are bits of code that tell ChatGPT
                    how to use an external resource on the Internet.

                  <p>
                    Basically, if a developer wants to give ChatGPT the ability
                    to access any network service (for example: "looking up
                    current stock prices") or perform any task controlled by a
                    network service (for example: "ordering pizza through the
                    Internet"), it is now possible, provided it doesn't go
                    against OpenAI's rules.

                  <p>
                    Conventionally, most large language models (LLM) like
                    ChatGPT have been constrained in a bubble, so to speak, only
                    able to interact with the world through text conversations
                    with a user. As OpenAI writes in its introductory

                    Humans are social creatures. But what leads to them being
                    this way? To fully understand how the brain gives rise to
                    social behaviors, we need to investigate it during social
                    encounters. Moreover, we need to analyze not only the
                    internal operations of one brain during social activities
                    but also the dynamic interplay between multiple brains
                    engaged in the same activity. This emerging research field
                    is referred to as "second-person neuroscience" and employs
                    hyperscanning (the simultaneous recording of the activity of
                    multiple brains) as the signature technique.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Now, a research team led by Yasuyo Minagawa of Keio
                    University, Japan, has worked out an elegant solution to
                    this problem. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each pair of participants (39 pairs in total) engaged in a
                    natural, cooperative, and creative task: the design and
                    furnishing of a digital room in a computer game. They were
                    allowed to communicate freely to create a room that
                    satisfied both. The participants also completed the same
                    task alone as the researchers sought to compare
                    between-brain synchronizations (BBSs) and within-brain
                    synchronizations (WBSs) during the individual and
                    cooperative tasks. The social behavior that the team focused
                    on during the tasks was eye gaze, that is, whether the
                    participants directed their gaze at the other's face. They
                    automatically extracted this behavior from the video footage
                    using an open-source software, which made the data analysis
                    easier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the most intriguing findings of the study was that,
                    during cooperative play, there was a strong BBS among the
                    superior and middle temporal regions and specific parts of
                    the prefrontal cortex in the right hemisphere, but little
                    WBS in comparison. Moreover, the BBS synchronization was
                    strongest when one of the participants raised their gaze to
                    look at the other. Interestingly, the situation reversed
                    during individual play, showing increased WBS within the
                    same regions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Minagawa, these results agree with the idea
                    that our brains work as a "two-in-one system" during certain
                    social interactions. "Neuron populations within one brain
                    were activated simultaneously with similar neuron
                    populations in the other brain when the participants
                    cooperated to complete the task, as if the two brains
                    functioned together as a single system for creative
                    problem-solving," she explains. "These phenomena are
                    consistent with the notion of a 'we-mode,' in which
                    interacting agents share their minds in a collective fashion
                    and facilitate interaction by accelerating access to the
                    other's cognition."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, this study provides evidence hinting at the
                    remarkable capability of the human brain to understand and
                    synchronize with others' when the situation calls for it.

                    We don't yet know if the amount of plastic that humans
                    ingest might be enough to shape our microbiomes. People
                    ingest a lot less plastic than seabirds do, says Richard
                    Thompson, a professor of marine biology at the University of
                    Plymouth in the UK. The amount of plastic that gets into our
                    bodies also depends on where we live and work. People who
                    work in textile factories will have a higher exposure than
                    those who work outdoors, for example.

                    microbes that aren't on plastics, Thompson points out. For
                    example, we might worry that tiny bits of plastic might pick
                    up nasty bugs in wastewater, and that these might somehow
                    end up in our bodies. But wastewater overflows regularly
                    contaminate beaches and drinking water directly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There's a chance microbes that break down plastic will end
                    up residing in our guts too. It's difficult to know how—or
                    whether—this will affect us. Microbes can evolve quickly,
                    and they can swap genes with neighboring bugs. "Are we going
                    to evolve to eat plastic? My answer would likely be no,"
                    says Fackelmann. But the possibility that our guts will
                    become home to more microbes that can break down plastic is
                    "not beyond the realm of possibility," she says.

                    on Github's security blog reveals that the company has

                    will have to delete your local GitHub SSH key, and fetch new

                    For almost everyone, this warning is spurious. It's not that

                    published new ones. Hanlon's Razor applies, as it most often

                    Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately
                    explained by stupidity. (The word <em>stupidity</em> is
                    often replaced with <em>incompetence</em>, but then, one
                    does tend to lead to the other.)

                    Researchers used a technique to separate sperm on whether
                    they had an X chromosome (making female offspring) or a Y
                    one (male offspring). Sperm with an X chromosome are
                    slightly heavier than those with a Y, the research
                    indicates.

                    However, the study has again raised long-held concerns over
                    the ethics of such a process. Selecting embryos without
                    reasons such as a sex-linked disease is illegal in many

                    The desire to have offspring of a specific sex has a long
                    history but has been particularly present since the 1970s
                    with the early appearance of assisted reproduction. The
                    reasons for choosing a child's sex may be social, such as a
                    desire for family balancing [1]. Couples undergoing IVF, who
                    already have a child or children of one sex, may wish to
                    have the experience of raising children of both sexes. Some
                    couples, who already have children, could have financial
                    reasons for not attempting a further pregnancy without
                    assurance that the additional child will be of a specific
                    sex.

                    was found in Google's Markup image-editing app for its Pixel
                    smartphones. According to reverse engineers Simon Aarons and
                    David Buchanan – who named the bug aCropalyse – the problem
                    affects Pixel smartphones since 2018, when the 3 series came
                    out. Google patched its code to avoid leaking cropped areas
                    of images.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then this week, Buchanan confirmed that the Windows Snipping
                    Tool and Snip &amp; Sketch software had the same issue. If a
                    user cropped a photo or other image using the software and
                    then saved the edited image over the original file, that
                    file still contains the cropped-out portion. The area isn't
                    visible when viewing the image using normal tools, but the
                    data is still there in the file, and can be restored and
                    viewed using appropriate recovery software.

                    Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at the
                    UK's University College London, shared some thoughts

                    on the underlying issue within Windows, specifically its
                    latest Save File API, which he described as "defective by
                    design."

                    [...] Meanwhile, if you've used Microsoft's code to crop
                    your snaps and then shared them on, be aware someone with a
                    copy of them might be able to recover the lopped-off
                    portions. ®

                    is made of 3D-printed soft rubber containing shape-memory
                    alloy springs that react to electrical currents by
                    contracting, which causes the actuator to bend. The team
                    used this bistable motion to change the actuator or robot's
                    shape. Once the robot changes shape, it is stable until
                    another electrical charge morphs it back to its previous
                    configuration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The actuators require only a hundred millisecond of
                    electrical charge to change their shape, and they are
                    durable. The team had a person ride a bicycle over one of
                    the actuators a few times and changed their robots' shapes
                    hundreds of times to demonstrate durability.

                  <p>
                    In the future, the robots could be used in rescue situations
                    or to interact with sea animals or coral. Using
                    heat-activated springs in the actuators could open up
                    applications in environmental monitoring, haptics, and
                    reconfigurable electronics and communication.

                    Ultimately it depends what you think it means to be an AGI,
                    and how much deeper this particular rabbit hole can go in
                    terms of capabilities developments. All the standard

                    Their discussion about how to make it more intelligent
                    involves incremental improvements, and abilities like
                    confidence calibration, long-term memory and continual
                    learning. The rest of the list: Personalization, planning
                    and conceptual leaps, transparency, interpretability and
                    consistency, improvement on cognitive fallacies and
                    irrationality, challenges with sensitivity to inputs.
                    Continual learning does seem like a potential big step in
                    this. Many others seem to involve a confusion between
                    capabilities that cause intelligence, and capabilities that
                    result from intelligence.

                    its National Emergency Library program.

                    [...] In his ruling, Judge Koetl considered whether the
                    Internet Archive was operating under the principle of Fair
                    Use, which
                    <a
                      href="https://www.eff.org/cases/authors-guild-v-hathitrust"

                    a digital book preservation project by Google Books and
                    HathiTrust in 2014, among other users. Fair Use considers
                    whether using a copyrighted work is good for the public, how
                    much it'll impact the copyright holder, how much of the work
                    has been copied, and whether the use has "transformed" a
                    copyrighted thing into something new, among other things.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Koetl wrote that any "alleged benefits" from the
                    Internet Archive's library "cannot outweigh the market harm
                    to the publishers," declares that "there is nothing
                    transformative about [Internet Archive's] copying and
                    unauthorized lending," and that copying these books doesn't
                    provide "criticism, commentary, or information about them."
                    He notes that the Google Books use was found
                    "transformative" because it created a searchable database
                    instead of simply publishing copies of books on the
                    internet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Internet Archive says it will continue acting as a
                    library in other ways, despite the decision. "This case does
                    not challenge many of the services we provide with digitized
                    books including interlibrary loan, citation linking, access
                    for the print-disabled, text and data mining, purchasing
                    ebooks, and ongoing donation and preservation of books,"
                    writes Freeland.

                    A federal judge has ruled against the Internet Archive in
                    its high-profile case against a group of four US publishers
                    led by Hachette Book Group. Per

                      ><em>Reuters</em></a
                    >, Judge John G. Koeltl declared on Friday the nonprofit had
                    infringed on the group's copyrights by lending out digitally
                    scanned copies of their books.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit originated from the Internet Archive's decision
                    to launch the "National Emergency Library" during the early
                    days of the pandemic. The program saw the organization offer
                    more than 1.4 million free ebooks, including copyrighted
                    works, in response to libraries worldwide closing their
                    doors due to coronavirus lockdown measures.

                    [...] Going into this week's trial, the Internet Archive
                    argued the initiative was protected by the principle of Fair
                    Use, which allows the unlicensed use of copyrighted works
                    under some circumstances. As

                    Internet Archive's stance, declaring "there is nothing
                    transformative" about lending unauthorized copies of books.
                    "Although [the Internet Archive] has the right to lend print

                    What just happened? Linus Tech Tips, one of the largest and
                    most popular technology YouTube channels on the platform,
                    has been hacked. It was used by the hackers to show
                    pre-recorded 'live-streaming' crypto-scam videos, featuring
                    former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The
                    channel is now showing a message stating it has been shut
                    down for violating YouTube's community guidelines, but it
                    appears Linus' other channels are also being abused.

                    Linus Sebastian's Linus Tech Tips YouTube channel has been
                    running since 2008 and has amassed 15.8 million subscribers.
                    The Canadian has several channels under the Linus Media
                    Group banner, including TechLinked, but the main one remains
                    the most popular. Sadly for all involved, it's become the
                    latest high-profile channel to be hacked.<br />[...]<br />YouTube
                    has shuttered the channel for violating its guidelines, but
                    it seems the hackers have now gone after other Linus Media
                    Group accounts. TechLinked has been renamed Tesla and is
                    showing the same Musk livestream.<br />[...]<br />While all
                    the content from the channels has been deleted, Linus
                    previously created several videos showing off the high-end
                    hardware used to store the terabytes of backups the company
                    created over the years.

                    The last decade or so has seen the creeping techification of
                    the auto industry. Executives will tell you the trend is
                    being driven by consumers, starry-eyed at their smartphones
                    and tablets, although

                    But automakers have been trying to adopt more than just
                    shiny gadgets and iterating software releases. They also
                    want some of that lucrative "recurring revenue" that so

                  <p>
                    AutoPacific asked people looking to buy a new vehicle about
                    their interest in 11 different in-car connected features,
                    starting with a data plan for the car for a hypothetical
                    price of $15/month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results may chasten some of the investors demanding that
                    the car companies keep traveling down this path. The most
                    in-demand or desirable feature was Internet connection with
                    a Wi-Fi hotspot—not an unreasonable demand for $15 per
                    month. But only 30 percent of people looking to buy a new
                    car said they were interested in paying for their car's
                    Internet access.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] AutoPacific also broke down some of its data by age
                    brackets. The 30- to 39-year-old group was consistently the
                    most interested in connected subscription features for their
                    cars—28 percent want to stream video directly to the
                    infotainment screen, 20 percent want to play video games on
                    the infotainment screen, and 18 percent want in-car video
                    conferencing. As you might expect, the 60- to 69-year-old
                    bracket was the least interested in any of this stuff; just
                    10 percent would want in-car video streaming, with video
                    conferencing at 5 percent and in-car gaming at just 4
                    percent.

                    [...] The report quotes a former senior employee as saying,
                    "Arm is going to customers and saying, 'We would like to get
                    paid more money for broadly the same thing.' What SoftBank
                    is doing at the moment is testing the market value of the
                    monopoly that Arm has."

                    If customers decide they don't like Arm's new pricing
                    structure, the competition is getting closer than it ever
                    has before. While Arm is basically a mobile monopoly in
                    everything smaller than a laptop, RISC-V is an upstart
                    project that promises power-efficient chips under a
                    royalty-free open source license. While Arm has an
                    incredible amount of ecosystem support with device designs,
                    a large user base, and a million developer tools, Arm's
                    continual drama is making a switch to RISC-V look more worth
                    the effort with each passing day.

                    Amazon has said it can offer speeds of up to one gigabit per
                    second, and  bandwidth of one terabit per satellite. Those
                    are similar to Starlink's numbers, and the two services seem
                    fairly similar overall. The key difference is that Starlink
                    is operational, and has been for years, whereas Amazon does
                    not plan to start offering Kuiper as a service until the
                    latter half of 2024, giving SpaceX a considerable head start
                    to attract users and secure contracts.

                  <p>
                    There remain concerns, too, about space junk and the impact
                    on ground-based astronomy. Before 2019 there were only about
                    3,000 active satellites in space. SpaceX and Amazon by
                    themselves could increase that number to 20,000 by the end
                    of this decade. Tracking large numbers of moving objects in
                    orbit—and making sure they don't collide with one another—is
                    a headache.

                    Huawei's focus on EDA software for 14nm and larger chips
                    reflects the current state of China's semiconductor
                    industry. State-backed foundry operator SMIC currently
                    possesses the ability to produce 14nm chips at scale,
                    although there have been some reports the company has had
                    success developing a 7nm process node.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To put that in perspective, TSMC and Samsung are currently
                    <a

                    >
                    production of 3nm process tech, while Intel has said it will
                    have a 2nm chip in production by late next year. This puts
                    China's semiconductor industry two to three generations
                    behind that of Taiwan, South Korea, and the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, 14nm isn't cutting edge, though it's also not useless.
