                    Occasionally when Signal is in the press and getting a lot
                    of favorable discussion, I feel the need to step into
                    various forums, IRC channels, and so on, and explain why I
                    don't trust Signal. Let's do a blog post instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Off the bat, let me explain that I expect a tool which
                    claims to be secure to actually be secure. I don't view "but
                    that makes it harder for the average person" as an
                    acceptable excuse. If Edward Snowden and Bruce Schneier are
                    going to spout the virtues of the app, I expect it to
                    <em>actually</em> be secure when it matters - when
                    vulnerable people using it to encrypt sensitive
                    communications are targeted by smart and powerful
                    adversaries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Making promises about security without explaining the
                    tradeoffs you made in order to appeal to the average user is
                    unethical. Tradeoffs are necessary - but self-serving
                    tradeoffs are not, and it's your responsibility to clearly
                    explain the drawbacks and advantages of the tradeoffs you
                    make. If you make broad and inaccurate statements about your
                    communications product being "secure", then when the
                    political prisoners who believed you are being tortured and
                    hanged, it's on you. The stakes are serious. Let me explain
                    why I don't think Signal takes them seriously.

                    Amphisbaenians are strange creatures. Like worms with
                    vertebrae, scales, a large central tooth and sometimes small
                    forearms, these reptiles live underground, burrowing tunnels
                    and preying on just about anything they encounter, not
                    unlike a miniature version of the monstrous sandworms from
                    "Dune."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even though they're found around much of the world, little
                    is known about how amphisbaenians behave in the wild because
                    they cannot be observed while in their natural habitat under
                    sand and soil. But thanks to two papers published in the
                    March issue of The Anatomical Record, new light is being
                    shed on these animals and their specialized anatomy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "You could fit three skulls of the Zygaspis
                    quadrifrons on the nail of my pinky. We can now look at
                    these really small vertebrate organisms in a measure of
                    detail that we never had before," Bell said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "They wriggle around and try to escape and move in
                    ways that worms just aren't able to. These are much more
                    like little snakes in the way that they move and interact.
                    It's just surprising for something that's so tiny. You just
                    don't expect that behavior," Lewis said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some of the most striking imagery to come from these CT
                    scans highlights sutures within the skull: deep, thin waves
                    that "grab" on to each other, Lewis described. The images
                    also render in exquisite details the amphisbaenians' strange
                    singular central tooth, which interlocks with two bottom
                    teeth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Combined with the powerful jaw muscles in amphisbaenians,
                    it gives them a ferocious bite for an animal of their size.
                    They can bite and tear out pieces of their prey," Bell said.

                    I've written before about my nostalgia for the Windows XP-
                    or Windows 7-era "clean install," when you could
                    substantially improve any given pre-made PC merely by taking
                    an official direct-from-Microsoft Windows install disk and
                    blowing away the factory install, ridding yourself of 60-day
                    antivirus trials, WildTangent games, outdated drivers, and
                    whatever other software your PC maker threw on it to help
                    subsidize its cost.

                    You can still do that with Windows 11—in fact, it's
                    considerably easier than it was in those '00s versions of
                    Windows, with multiple official Microsoft-sanctioned ways to
                    download and create an install disk, something you used to

                I am a long-time macOS user, and willingly pay the hefty Apple
                "tax" to use it because macOS behaves itself, but I am forced to
                use Windows 11 at work and I hate it for many of the reasons
                outlined in this article. Windows, like DOS before it decades
                ago, has become a boot-sector virus. Windows delenda est!

                    ...<br />"The DRD4/7R allele has been linked to greater food
                    and drug cravings, novelty-seeking, and ADHD symptoms,"
                    explained study leader Dan Eisenberg back in 2008. "It is
                    possible that in the nomadic setting, a boy with this allele
                    might be able to more effectively defend livestock against
                    raiders or locate food and water sources, but that the same
                    tendencies might not be as beneficial in settled pursuits
                    such as focusing in school, farming or selling goods."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So a fascinating hypothesis emerged. Could the genetic
                    traits of ADHD be somewhat beneficial to a tribe by pushing
                    some people to be 'explorers'? What manifests in modern
                    times as fidgety restlessness could actually have been
                    useful to tribes foraging the countryside for food.<br />...<br />Around
                    450 people participated in the experiment, and all were
                    simultaneously screened for ADHD symptoms. Unsurprisingly,
                    the researchers found those with higher ADHD scores moved on
                    to new bushes sooner than others but more importantly, those
                    with ADHD also tended to collect higher volumes of berries
                    overall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Writing in the newly published study, Barack and colleagues
                    noted that participants without ADHD characteristics tended
                    to over-harvest single patches. Looking at what would be an
                    optimal harvest strategy for the game it was discovered that
                    players with high ADHD scores were more successful overall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In addition, we discovered that participants that screened
                    positive for ADHD more readily abandoned patches and
                    achieved higher reward rates than did participants who
                    screened negative," the researchers concluded. "Given the
                    over-staying displayed by participants overall, those with
                    elevated ASRS scores made exploratory decisions that were
                    more closely aligned with the predictions of optimal
                    foraging theory, and, in this sense, behaved more
                    optimally."

                OS/2 was a joint operating system project by IBM and Microsoft,
                which was intended for IBM's own Personal System/2 (PS/2) PCs.
                (If you've ever seen the old circular ports used by keyboards
                and mice on old PCs, those are also called PS/2 ports— because
                they're inherited from this.)
              </p>
              <p>
                While OS/2 comes after the original IBM PC DOS and MS-DOS, we
                know today that the partnership between IBM and Microsoft would
                not last in that form. Microsoft eventually stopped working with
                IBM in 1992 when it dropped Windows 3.1, a direct competitor of
                the OS/2 software IBM paid it to make.
              </p>
              <p>
                OS/2 was intended as a protected-mode successor of PC DOS
                targeting the Intel 80286 processor. Notably, basic system calls
                were modeled after MS-DOS calls; their names even started with
                "Dos" and it was possible to create "Family Mode" applications –
                text mode applications that could work on both systems. Because
                of this heritage, OS/2 shares similarities with Unix, Xenix, and
                Windows NT.
              </p>
              <p>
                Up to $990 million per year was spent developing OS/2 and its
                replacement. OS/2 sales were largely concentrated in networked
                computing used by corporate professionals; however, by the early
                1990s, it was overtaken by Microsoft Windows NT. While OS/2 was
                arguably technically superior to Microsoft Windows 95, OS/2
                failed to develop much penetration in the mass market consumer
                and stand-alone desktop PC segments.
              </p>
              <p>
                IBM discontinued its support for OS/2 on December 31, 2006.
                Since then, OS/2 has been developed, supported and sold by two
                different third-party vendors under license from IBM – first by
                Serenity Systems as eComStation since 2001, and later by Arca
                Noae LLC as ArcaOS since 2017.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're reading this before April 15, 2024, and wish to dig
                into OS/2 computing history, you're also advised to check out
                the Hobbes OS/2 Archive while it still exists. The Hobbes OS/2
                Archive is the longest-lived host of OS/2 software, but the
                decades have finally caught up to it, and it's set to close in
                April.<br />

                Submitter remembers buying OS/2 Warp (
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2"
                  >https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2</a
                >
                ) (although, not really sure which version) : The box I bought
                (if memory serves... which it doesn't Batman...) came with a CD
                and like 10 diskettes. I didn't have a CD drive at the time, so
                had to install from the many diskettes, which didn't always
                install failure free. Finally got it installed and tried it out
                some, but, again if memory serves, had so little hard-drive
                space that i couldn't install much else to fool with to test
                compatibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then Windows Whatever came along (remember "Start me up" from
                the Rolling Stones?) and then finally found Linux and never
                looked back.

                    For the supermassive black hole's size, the researchers
                    propose two possible estimates: one at 17 billion solar
                    masses, and the other at 19 billion solar masses. That's not
                    the most massive one known, but there are only about a dozen
                    thought to be larger. (For comparison, the one at the center
                    of the Milky Way is "only" about 4 million solar masses.)
                    The data is best fit by a moderate spin, with us viewing it
                    from about 45 degrees off the pole of the black hole. The
                    accretion disk would be roughly seven light-years across.
                    Meaning, if the system were centered on our Sun, several
                    nearby stars would be within the disk.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The accretion rate needed to power the brightness is just
                    below the Eddington limit and works out to roughly 370 solar
                    masses of material per year. Or, about a Sun a day. At that
                    rate, it would take about 30 million years to double in
                    size.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The whole accretion disk is also large enough that it
                    should be possible to image it with the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/"
                      >Very Large Telescope</a
                    >, which would allow us to track the disk's rotation and
                    estimate the black hole's mass.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The system's extreme nature, then, may actually help us
                    figure out its details despite its immense distance.
                    Meanwhile, the researchers wonder whether other unusual
                    systems might remain undiscovered simply because we haven't
                    considered that an object might be a quasar instead of a
                    star.

                    Bianchini was a professor of mathematics and astronomy at
                    the University of Ferrara, but he also had a background in
                    what we'd now call finance – he was a merchant, and managed
                    assets and investments for a wealthy ruling family of the
                    time. That real-world experience seems to have influenced
                    his mathematical work, since Bianchini was known to have
                    created his own system of dividing measurement units like
                    feet into 10 equal parts to make them easier to work with.
                    As fundamental as it feels to modern sensibilities, it
                    didn't catch on with the 15th century crowd who were used to
                    a base-60 system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, Dr. Glen Van Brummelen, a professor at Trinity Western
                    University in Canada, has discovered that Bianchini
                    illustrated this system with a decimal point, the first
                    ever. Van Brummelen found that in a manuscript called
                    Tabulae primi mobilis B, Bianchini was using numbers with
                    dots in the middle – the first one being 10.4 – and showing
                    how to multiply them, something that was tricky in a base-60
                    system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I realized that he's using this just as we do, and he knows
                    how to do calculations with it," Van Brummelen told Nature.
                    "I remember running up and down the hallways of the dorm
                    with my computer trying to find anybody who was awake,
                    shouting 'look at this, this guy is doing decimal points in
                    the 1440s!'"

                    attempt to create a new Will-Smith-eating-spaghetti AI
                    video, but the result would likely be far better than what
                    we saw last year, even if it contained obvious glitches.

                    When reached for comment, Joshua Rogers, the developer of
                    SSH-Snake, told The Hacker News that the tool offers
                    legitimate system owners a way to identify weaknesses in
                    their infrastructure before attackers do, urging companies
                    to use SSH-Snake to "discover the attack paths that exist –
                    and fix them." "It seems to be commonly believed that cyber
                    terrorism 'just happens' all of a sudden to systems, which
                    solely requires a reactive approach to security," Rogers
                    said. "Instead, in my experience, systems should be designed
                    and maintained with comprehensive security measures."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If a cyber terrorist is able to run SSH-Snake on your
                    infrastructure and access thousands of servers, focus should
                    be put on the people that are in charge of the
                    infrastructure, with a goal of revitalizing the
                    infrastructure such that the compromise of a single host
                    can't be replicated across thousands of others."

                  <p>
                    At $US15,000, BYD's new Qin EV is already being touted as a
                    "Corolla killer" as the world's second largest EV maker
                    continues to disrupt the global auto market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Launched earlier this week in China, the all-electric Qin
                    Plus has five models priced between 109,800 RMB to
                    ($A23,300) to 139,800 RMB ($A29,700).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Qin Plus comes with a 100 kW motor and the option of
                    either a 48 kWh battery providing 420 km CLTC range or a
                    57.6 kW hour battery with 510 km range.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Indeed, most legacy car makers, at least those that
                    are bothering to make EVs at scale at all, are still focused
                    on the top end of the market, selling premium and heavy and
                    high cost EVs, largely to protect their ICE business. In the
                    US, the major car makers are retreating rapidly on their EV
                    plans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    BYD, which is challenging Tesla as the biggest EV maker in
                    the world, says it's "officially opening a new era where
                    electricity is lower than oil."

                      >EFF wrote in 2021</a
                    >. "It effectively decided that the only way for an ISP to
                    avoid being liable for infringement by its users is to
                    terminate a household or business's account after a small
                    number of accusations—perhaps only two. The court also
                    allowed a damages formula that can lead to nearly unlimited
                    damages, with no relationship to any actual harm suffered.
                    If not overturned, this decision will lead to an untold
                    number of people losing vital Internet access as ISPs start
                    to cut off more and more customers to avoid massive

                    In today's 4th Circuit ruling, appeals court judges wrote
                    that "Sony failed, as a matter of law, to prove that Cox
                    profits directly from its subscribers' copyright
                    infringement."

                    A defendant may be vicariously liable for a third party's
                    copyright infringement if it profits directly from it and is
                    in a position to supervise the infringer, the ruling said.
                    Cox argued that it doesn't profit directly from infringement
                    because it receives the same monthly fee from subscribers
                    whether they illegally download copyrighted files or not,
                    the ruling noted.

                    Cycles of a diet that mimics fasting can reduce signs of
                    immune system aging, as well as insulin resistance and liver
                    fat in humans, resulting in a lower biological age,
                    according to a new USC Leonard Davis School of
                    Gerontology-led study.

                  <p>
                    The study, published in Nature Communications on Feb. 20,
                    adds to the body of evidence supporting the beneficial
                    effects of the fasting-mimicking diet (FMD).

                  <p>
                    The FMD is a five-day diet high in unsaturated fats and low
                    in overall calories, protein, and carbohydrates and is
                    designed to mimic the effects of a water-only fast while
                    still providing necessary nutrients and making it much
                    easier for people to complete the fast. The diet was
                    developed by the laboratory of USC Leonard Davis School
                    Professor Valter Longo, the senior author of the new study.

                    and on a validated method developed by the Levine group to
                    assess biological age," Longo said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Previous research led by Longo has indicated that brief,
                    periodic FMD cycles are associated with a range of
                    beneficial effects. They can:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p>Promote stem cell regeneration</p></li>
                    <li>Lessen chemotherapy side effects</li>
                    <li>Reduce the signs of dementia in mice</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    In addition, the FMD cycles can lower the risk factors for
                    cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other age-related
                    diseases in humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Longo lab also had previously shown that one or two
                    cycles of the FMD for five days a month increased the
                    healthspan and lifespan of mice on either a normal or
                    Western diet, but the effects of the FMD on aging and
                    biological age, liver fat, and immune system aging in humans
                    were unknown until now.

                    reported that Reddit has signed a contract allowing an
                    unnamed AI company to train its models on the site's
                    content, according to people familiar with the matter. The
                    move comes as the social media platform nears the
                    introduction of its initial public offering (IPO), which
                    could happen as soon as next month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Reddit initially revealed the deal, which is reported to be
                    worth $60 million a year, earlier in 2024 to potential
                    investors of an anticipated IPO, Bloomberg said. The
                    Bloomberg source speculates that the contract could serve as
                    a model for future agreements with other AI companies.

                    expressly seeking any rightsholder permission, some tech
                    firms have more recently begun entering deals where some
                    content used for training AI models similar to GPT-4 (which
                    runs the paid version of ChatGPT) comes under license. In

                    with German publisher Axel Springer (publisher of Politico
                    and Business Insider) for access to its articles.
                    Previously, OpenAI has struck deals with other

                    If the reported $60 million/year deal goes through, it's
                    quite possible that if you've ever posted on Reddit, some of
                    that material may be used to train the next generation of AI
                    models that create text, still pictures, and video. Even

                    is the most common author in the library. One copy of his
                    History of Plato's Academy was probably his own draft, so we
                    can be confident the library is made up in part from his
                    books. This is also why we think the owner of the villa was
                    Julius Caesar's father-in-law, L. Calpurnius Piso
                    Caesoninus: we know Philodemus was his personal philosopher,
                    and only the highest Roman elite could afford a house that
                    big.

                    Epicurus makes up a substantial proportion of the library

                    resurrected as well, including Metrodorus and Demetrius the

                        On February 20, 2024, an optimization to the user
                        experience introduced a bug with how the model processes
                        language. LLMs generate responses by randomly sampling
                        words based in part on probabilities. Their "language"
                        consists of numbers that map to tokens. In this case,
                        the bug was in the step where the model chooses these
                        numbers. Akin to being lost in translation, the model
                        chose slightly wrong numbers, which produced word
                        sequences that made no sense. More technically,
                        inference kernels produced incorrect results when used
                        in certain GPU configurations. Upon identifying the
                        cause of this incident, we rolled out a fix and
                        confirmed that the incident was resolved.

                      href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng/#%7Bitemid:[001-230854]%7D"

                    that weakening end-to-end encryption disproportionately
                    risks undermining human rights. The international court's
                    decision could potentially disrupt the European Commission's
                    proposed plans to require email and messaging service
                    providers to create backdoors that would allow law
                    enforcement to easily decrypt users' messages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This ruling came after Russia's intelligence agency, the
                    Federal Security Service (FSS), began requiring Telegram to
                    share users' encrypted messages to deter "terrorism-related
                    activities" in 2017, ECHR's ruling said. A Russian Telegram
                    user alleged that FSS's requirement violated his rights to a
                    private life and private communications, as well as all
                    Telegram users' rights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Telegram user was apparently disturbed, moving to block
                    required disclosures after Telegram refused to comply with
                    an FSS order to decrypt messages on six users suspected of
                    terrorism. According to Telegram, "it was technically
                    impossible to provide the authorities with encryption keys
                    associated with specific users," and therefore, "any
                    disclosure of encryption keys" would affect the "privacy of
                    the correspondence of all Telegram users," the ECHR's ruling
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For refusing to comply, Telegram was fined, and one court
                    even ordered the app to be blocked in Russia, while dozens
                    of Telegram users rallied to continue challenging the order
                    to maintain Telegram services in Russia. Ultimately, users'
                    multiple court challenges failed, sending the case before
                    the ECHR while Telegram services seemingly tenuously
                    remained available in Russia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Seemingly most critically, the government told the
                    ECHR that any intrusion on private lives resulting from
                    decrypting messages was "necessary" to combat terrorism in a
                    democratic society. To back up this claim, the government
                    pointed to a 2017 terrorist attack that was "coordinated
                    from abroad through secret chats via Telegram." The
                    government claimed that a second terrorist attack that year
                    was prevented after the government discovered it was being
                    coordinated through Telegram chats.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the end, the ECHR concluded that the Telegram
                    user's rights had been violated, partly due to privacy
                    advocates and international reports that corroborated
                    Telegram's position that complying with the FSB's disclosure
                    order would force changes impacting all its users.

              <p><b>Statistics</b></p>
              <p>
                Community members sometimes ask for details of our community
                size and the level of activity that they create. I have
                collected some statistics which might be of interest. It is
                important to note that these are a very small snapshot of our
                overall activity but they are typical of the last few weeks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each week there are around 250-300 unique UIDs logging on to the
                site with occasional peaks just above 300. These are people who
                actually log in using their username and so represent only a
                portion of those who read the stories that we produce.
                Interestingly perhaps, they use around 7500 different IP
                addresses indicating perhaps that VPN use is increasing from
                what it was a few years ago and, equally likely, that they are
                logging in using different devices and perhaps from different
                locations (work, home, laptop, smartphone etc). But this is only
                those logging in by name. Others prefer to use our RSS feeds and
                dedicated software so that they can see the output of several
                different sites in a single display. Finally, there is the group
                who never log in but who read our front page content without
                making comments or joining in by moderating. Nothing can be done
                to identify their numbers. Elsewhere on the site there are an
                unknown number of Anonymous Cowards who participate in the
                discussions in journals. The current statistics do not include
                journal discussions as far as I can tell.
              </p>
              <p>
                The daily figures indicate that we receive somewhere between 60
                and 180 comments per day. This varies considerably from day to
                day. Some only log in at weekends, others only log in during the
                working week, and of course it also depends on the actual
                stories themselves. Some stories can attract over 50 comments or
                more alone whereas others, which are there to inform but not
                necessarily require a response from anyone, might only gather a
                few comments. But a better picture can be gathered by looking at
                the page hits. The average number of article hits per day is
                over 2500. Each week we serve almost 250,000 pages but because
                we use a simple text format with virtually no graphics, adverts
                or anything else distracting it appears to only amount to single
                digit GBs. Again there is a significant daily variation. There
                is also a variation of course during the 24 hour period with the
                site receiving between 2 and 5 hits per second. This is not as
                clear to see as you might think it would be and it seems to
                suggest that either people keep very unusual hours or that our
                readership is spread far more evenly around the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                As an aside, it was possible to see the breaks during the
                SuperBowl transmission as, on that particular day, the activity
                levels peaked significantly at those times.
              </p>
              <p><b>We Are Not a Linux Only Site</b></p>
              <p>
                Some comments have been critical that we are including stories
                about Microsoft Windows. Why shouldn't we? We always have done
                so. We are not limited to a single OS. We can discuss any OS, or
                indeed any software whatsoever. Some of our community have
                chosen Windows because it is what they like, others use it
                because it is necessary to have it to control a specific item of
                equipment or produce a specific data format, and for others it
                is forced upon them by work or contractual obligations. I
                realise that we have far more Linux users than any other OS but
                that is because our community includes many who have the
                technical ability to manage it and an interest in open source
                software. Like it or not, Windows is included in STEM. Just
                because we don't all choose to use it doesn't mean it no longer
                exists.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember, it is YOU who provide the submissions. The editors'
                job is to prepare them for publication while maintaining as much
                variety as possible in discussions. So let us hear your praise
                or gripes about BSD variants, Linux variants (e.g. including
                TAILS, recovery thumb-drives etc) or any other OS that you use
                today or have used in the past. If you are using it today then
                tell us why you chose that particular OS.
              </p>
              <p><b>Spamming</b></p>
              <p>
                We have had a couple of dormant accounts suddenly spring into
                life and start spamming. They had been created weeks or months
                ago but had been inactive since being created. If you see any
                similar activity please let the staff know - there could be many
                more. It is easy to stop it but with over 30,000 fake accounts
                it is a monumental task to watch them all. The standard Spammers
                ban (for 10+ years) was applied to both accounts. As it was,
                they were spamming where they were unlikely to be seen by many
                people
              </p>
              <p>
                Spamming continues to be a problem but it is being managed and
                that tends to keep it away from the main pages. We have our own
                local spammers of course. At the time of writing, one of them
                has posted the same message (beginning with "We don't hate you,
                my dear soft and fluffy khallow") a total of 97 times since 05
                February. It had already been posted many times before that but
                now we have new software that makes spamming easier to identify
                and a method to remove it from view. However, there is a copy of
                every comment that is 'removed'. The same person has posted 258
                spam comments in total in the same time period including a
                doxxing attempt. The site Policy document details the action
                that we can take against spammers. It refers to a graduated
                system. We have tried polite requests, (from 2021 onwards),
                followed by firmer requests, marking as Spam and recently we
                have increased that to the next level. The comments are removed
                from view. This is an exceptional measure and not one that is
                taken lightly. I do not expect that this will change anything
                but it does clean up a lot of the discussions in the poll and
                the journals and does take away the spammers 'voice'
                significantly. He is, of course, already permanently banned.
                That he is complaining many times a day makes me suspect it is
                also working as well as we could have expected.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is another local spammer who seems to be confused as to
                the method to be employed when making complaints but I am hoping
                that we can remedy this. Which brings me on to the next topic...
              </p>
              <p><b>Complaints About Staff or Policy</b></p>
              <p>
                It is no good complaining about how staff are managing the site
                or your own particular views of any individual staff member by
                making comments in a journal as an Anonymous Coward. Firstly, we
                are not responsible for the contents of journals so there is no
                guarantee that we will actually look at them (but we are
                responsible to our community for ensuring that the site is not
                abused, and that individuals are not harassed in attempts to try
                to silence them).
              </p>
              <p>
                Secondly, as an Anonymous Coward, you are welcome to participate
                on this site but you do not have much say in how it is run or
                managed. That privilege comes only with an account.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you wish to complain about a member of staff there are
                several actions that you can take. Send an email to our usual
                Admin email address (with an email address life expectancy of
                more than a few minutes, but we will accept emails from secure
                email sites such as Proton or Tuta Mail) to our usual Admin
                address. It does not only go to a single admin but goes to
                <b>every</b> admin. It will get read and, if the complaint
                requires it, it will be investigated and the appropriate action
                taken. If we cannot contact you then your complaint may be
                ignored. More serious complaints can be sent by mail to the
                site's formal address which you can find by looking at the
                business records of the site. That will go directly to the Board
                which, as you know, has the ultimate power on this site.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you wish to complain about the site's policy then the first
                action should again be to send an email (with an address life
                expectancy of more than a few minutes) to our usual Admin
                address with your reason for wanting a policy change and also
                submit a draft of what you would like the actual policy to be.
                It can then be presented to the community for further discussion
                and a vote. If we cannot contact you then it is unlikely that
                any action will be taken. If you do not provide at least a
                suggested solution then you cannot reasonably expect anyone to
                action your anonymous request.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a couple of community members who have been looking at
                policy issues for several years now. I think they will agree
                that we always give what they say serious consideration and
                implement what they suggest if it is possible. We learn a lot
                from each other. When the new site has been created then you
                will all be invited to make your suggestions as to future
                policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, complaints like "I don't like what you are doing -
                close the site down now!" will be carefully studied before we
                all roll around laughing and throw it in the trash can. If you
                do not like this site then you are free to go elsewhere. We do
                not have to close the site down simply because you are unhappy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nobody on the staff has a problem with receiving a genuine
                complaint if it is intended to improve the site or the
                community's enjoyment of it. But that enjoyment has to be
                applicable to the majority of the site, not simply to one or two
                individuals or even a significant minority.

                    Strong high-altitude winds over the Mid-Atlantic sped up sky
                    traffic on Saturday night, getting passengers on at least
                    two commercial planes to their destinations early, after
                    both aircraft hit supersonic speeds topping 800 mph.<br />[...]<br />"Although
                    its ground speed — a measure that combines the plane's
                    actual speed and the additional push from the wind — was
                    greater than the speed of sound, it was still moving through
                    the surrounding air at its ordinary cruise speed. It just so

                    America has returned to the moon after a 52-year absence.
                    The unmanned Odysseus spacecraft touched down on the lunar
                    surface shortly before 6:30 p.m. EST Thursday.

                    "We can confirm without a doubt that our equipment is on the
                    surface and we are on the moon. Odysseus has found a new
                    home," said Dr. Tim Crain, mission director of the IM-1, the
                    first American private venture to send a module to the moon.

                    It's the first time the United States has had a new presence
                    on the lunar surface since NASA's Apollo 11 in July 1969.

                    The Intuitive Machines Odysseus lunar lander, nicknamed
                    "Odie" or "IM-1," settled on the moon's surface after a
                    day's long trek but immediately began experiencing
                    communication problems, preventing the transmission of data.

                The general tone of this story here and elsewhere seems to be
                that this heralds a new era of a commercial space industry, but
                until one can show that there is any commercial value to being
                on the Moon besides directly supporting NASA/ESA/etc., is this a
                watershed moment, or is this just slightly expanding the
                potential NASA/ESA/etc. contractor pool? --hubie

                    [...] The OpenAI team plans to draw on the safety testing it
                    did last year for DALL-E 3. Sora already includes a filter
                    that runs on all prompts sent to the model that will block
                    requests for violent, sexual, or hateful images, as well as
                    images of known people. Another filter will look at frames
                    of generated videos and block material that violates
                    OpenAI's safety policies.

                  <p>
                    OpenAI says it is also adapting a fake-image detector
                    developed for DALL-E 3 to use with Sora. And the company
                    will embed industry-standard C2PA tags, metadata that states
                    how an image was generated, into all of Sora's output. But
                    these steps are far from foolproof. Fake-image detectors are
                    hit-or-miss. Metadata is easy to remove, and most social
                    media sites strip it from uploaded images by default.

                    In April, a New York start-up called Runway AI unveiled
                    technology that let people generate videos, like a cow at a
                    birthday party or a dog chatting on a smartphone, simply by

                    The four-second videos were blurry, choppy, distorted and
                    disturbing. But they were a clear sign that artificial
                    intelligence technologies would generate increasingly
                    convincing videos in the months and years to come.

                    Just 10 months later, the San Francisco start-up OpenAI has
                    unveiled a similar system that creates videos that look as
                    if they were lifted from a Hollywood movie. A demonstration
                    included short videos — created in minutes — of woolly
                    mammoths trotting through a snowy meadow, a monster gazing
                    at a melting candle and a Tokyo street scene seemingly shot
                    by a camera swooping across the city.

                    OpenAI is launching a new video-generation model, and it's
                    called Sora. The
                    <a href="https://openai.com/sora">AI company says Sora</a>
                    "can create realistic and imaginative scenes from text
                    instructions." The text-to-video model allows users to
                    create photorealistic videos up to a minute long — all based
                    on prompts they've written.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sora is capable of creating "complex scenes with multiple
                    characters, specific types of motion, and accurate details
                    of the subject and background," according to OpenAI's
                    introductory blog post. The company also notes that the
                    model can understand how objects "exist in the physical
                    world," as well as "accurately interpret props and generate
                    compelling characters that express vibrant emotions."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The model can also generate a video based on a still image,
                    as well as fill in missing frames on an existing video or
                    extend it. The Sora-generated demos included in OpenAI's
                    blog post include an aerial scene of California during the
                    gold rush, a video that looks as if it were shot from the
                    inside of a Tokyo train, and others. Many have some telltale
                    signs of AI — like a suspiciously moving floor in a video of
                    a museum — and OpenAI says the model "may struggle with
                    accurately simulating the physics of a complex scene," but
                    the results are overall pretty impressive.

                    disease experts said as of Friday, when this outbreak became
                    public knowledge, that it's highly likely the kids are not
                    vaccinated.

                    Most children get the MMR — or measles, mumps and rubella —
                    vaccine, but with a disease as contagious as measles,
                    doctors say it only takes a few holdouts to fuel an
                    outbreak. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and
                    Prevention shows Florida among the states in which parents
                    using a religious exemption to opt their children out of
                    traditional childhood vaccinations is trending upward.

                    "Definitely, parents today are much more hesitant than ever.
                    We actually are struggling in our pediatric practices to get
                    kids completely immunized, to complete their series by the
                    time they enter kindergarten because parents are scared,
                    they're kind of feeding into this misinformation," said Dr.
                    Lisa Gwynn, a pediatrician who teaches pediatrics at the
                    University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. "It is
                    extremely unfortunate because it's all preventable, and the
                    measles vaccine has been around a long time and it's safe
                    and effective, so the fact that we are still seeing this in
                    modern times is really unfortunate, it's also dangerous for
                    the community, measles is an extremely infectious and
                    contagious virus."

                    A few years ago, MIT researchers invented a
                    <a
                      href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/cryptographic-tag-supply-chain-0220"

                    that is several times smaller and significantly cheaper than
                    the traditional radio frequency tags (RFIDs) that are often
                    affixed to products to verify their authenticity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This tiny tag, which offers improved security over RFIDs,
                    utilizes terahertz waves, which are smaller and travel much
                    faster than radio waves [SIC - er, no] . But this terahertz
                    tag shared a major security vulnerability with traditional
                    RFIDs: A counterfeiter could peel the tag off a genuine item
                    and reattach it to a fake, and the authentication system
                    would be none the wiser.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers have now surmounted this security
                    vulnerability by leveraging terahertz waves to develop an
                    antitampering ID tag that still offers the benefits of being
                    tiny, cheap, and secure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They mix microscopic metal particles into the glue that
                    sticks the tag to an object, and then use terahertz waves to
                    detect the unique pattern those particles form on the item's
                    surface. Akin to a fingerprint, this random glue pattern is
                    used to authenticate the item, explains Eunseok Lee, an
                    electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) graduate
                    student and lead author of a paper on the antitampering tag.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These metal particles are essentially like mirrors for
                    terahertz waves. If I spread a bunch of mirror pieces onto a
                    surface and then shine light on that, depending on the
                    orientation, size, and location of those mirrors, I would
                    get a different reflected pattern. But if you peel the chip
                    off and reattach it, you destroy that pattern," adds Ruonan
                    Han, an associate professor in EECS, who leads the Terahertz
                    Integrated Electronics Group in the Research Laboratory of
                    Electronics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This research project was partly inspired by Han's
                    favorite car wash. The business stuck an RFID tag onto his
                    windshield to authenticate his car wash membership. For
                    added security, the tag was made from fragile paper so it
                    would be destroyed if a less-than-honest customer tried to
                    peel it off and stick it on a different windshield.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But that is not a terribly reliable way to prevent
                    tampering. For instance, someone could use a solution to
                    dissolve the glue and safely remove the fragile tag.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rather than authenticating the tag, a better security
                    solution is to authenticate the item itself, Han says. To
                    achieve this, the researchers targeted the glue at the
                    interface between the tag and the item's surface.

                    of organic solar cells could boost their efficiency by up to
                    two-thirds, while capturing light from a wider angle.

                    Solar cells are usually flat, which maximizes how much of
                    the surface is exposed to sunlight at any given time. This
                    design works best when the Sun is within a certain angle, so
                    the panels are usually tilted between 15 and 40 degrees to
                    get the most out of the day.

                    Scientists have toyed with other shapes for the surface,
                    including embedding

                    which trap and circulate sunlight to allow the device to
                    capture more energy from it. For the new study, scientists
                    at Abdullah Gül University in Türkiye ran complex
                    simulations of how dome-shaped bumps might boost organic
                    solar surfaces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team studied photovoltaic cells made with an organic
                    polymer called P3HT:ICBA as the active layer, above a layer
                    of aluminum and a substrate of PMMA, capped off with a
                    transparent protective layer of indium tin oxide (ITO). This
                    sandwich structure was kept through the whole dome, or
                    "hemispherical shell" as the team calls it.<br />...<br />Compared
                    to flat surfaces, solar cells dotted with bumps showed 36%
                    and 66% improvements in light absorption, depending on the
                    polarization of the light. Those bumps also allowed light to
                    enter from a wider range of directions than a flat surface,
                    providing an angular coverage of up to 82 degrees.

                First seen in a Buffalo News story (paywalled?) which ends with
                this:

                    Khavis said even in areas where newspapers didn't completely
                    close, but downsized or merged to the point where "they were
                    open in name only," they saw the same effect on nonprofit
                    executive pay.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The number of papers closing does not bode well for
                    "misbehavior" by institutions, Khavis said. Between 2004 and
                    2015, the U.S. newspaper industry lost more than 1,800 print
                    outlets to closures and mergers. A study by Northwestern
                    University's Medill School of Journalism found that the rate
                    of local newspaper closings accelerated to 2.5 per week in
                    2023.

                    Regardless of the application, machine learning models are
                    only as good as the data you feed them. A bias in the data,
                    even an unconscious one, can affect the conclusions made by
                    the algorithm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Machine learning models currently being used for pHLA
                    binding prediction assert that they can extrapolate for
                    allele data not present in the dataset those models were
                    trained on, calling themselves "pan-allele" or "all-allele."
                    The Rice team's findings call that into question.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What we are trying to show here and kind of debunk is the
                    idea of the 'pan-allele' machine learning predictors," Conev
                    said. "We wanted to see if they really worked for the data
                    that is not in the datasets, which is the data from
                    lower-income populations."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fasoulis' and Conev's group tested publicly available data
                    on pHLA binding prediction, and their findings supported
                    their hypothesis that a bias in the data was creating an
                    accompanying bias in the algorithm. The team hopes that by
                    bringing this discrepancy to the attention of the research
                    community, a truly pan-allele method of predicting pHLA
                    binding can be developed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ferreira, faculty advisor and paper co-author, explained
                    that the problem of bias in machine learning can't be
                    addressed unless researchers think about their data in a
                    social context. From a certain perspective, datasets may
                    appear as simply "incomplete," but making connections
                    between what is or what is not represented in the dataset
                    and underlying historical and economic factors affecting the
                    populations from which data was collected is key to
                    identifying bias.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Researchers using machine learning models sometimes
                    innocently assume that these models may appropriately
                    represent a global population," Ferreira said, "but our
                    research points to the significance of when this is not the
                    case." He added that "even though the databases we studied
                    contain information from people in multiple regions of the

                    Google has initiated significant layoffs across its various
                    teams, [...] marking a continuation of the tech industry's
                    trend towards reducing workforce expenses. The layoffs have
                    affected hundreds of employees within the Voice Assistant
                    unit; hardware teams responsible for Pixel, Nest and Fitbit
                    products; and a considerable portion of the augmented
                    reality (AR) team. This move is part of Google's broader
                    effort to streamline operations and align resources with its
                    most significant product priorities​​.

                  <p>
                    [....] This comes at a time when Google parent, Alphabet
                    Inc., reported record profits in late January. The company
                    reported $20.4 billion in net income in Q4.

                  <p>
                    [....] The layoffs have sparked widespread concern among
                    Google employees, not just about job security but also about
                    the ethical implications of their work, especially as the

                    PLPs [ protein-like polymers], developed by Gianneschi's
                    team, could represent a significant breakthrough in halting
                    or reversing damage offering hope for improved treatments
                    and outcomes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Focusing on the challenge of activating processes crucial
                    for the body's antioxidant response, the team's research
                    offers a novel solution. The team provides a robust,
                    selective method enabling enhanced cellular protection and
                    offering a promising therapeutic strategy for a range of
                    diseases including neurodegenerative conditions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Through modern polymer chemistry, we can begin to think
                    about mimicking complex proteins," Gianneschi said. "The
                    promise lies in the development of a new modality for the
                    design of therapeutics. This could be a way to address
                    diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's among others where
                    traditional approaches have struggled."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This approach not only represents a significant advance in
                    targeting transcription factors and disordered proteins, but
                    also showcases the PLP technology's versatility and
                    potential to revolutionize the development of therapeutics.
                    The technology's modularity and efficacy in inhibiting the
                    Keap1/Nrf2 interaction underscore its potential for impact
                    as a therapeutic, but also as a tool for studying the
                    biochemistry of these processes.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    In a paper published in the <em>Astronomical Journal</em>, a
                    team of researchers from the SETI Institute, Berkeley SETI
                    Research Center and the University of Washington reported an
                    exciting development for the field of astrophysics and the
                    search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), using
                    observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
                    (TESS) mission to monitor the SETI Ellipsoid, a method for
                    identifying potential signals from advanced civilizations in
                    the cosmos. The SETI Ellipsoid is a strategic approach for
                    selecting potential technosignature candidates based on the
                    hypothesis that extraterrestrial civilizations, upon
                    observing significant galactic events such as supernova
                    1987A, might use these occurrences as a focal point to emit
                    synchronized signals to announce their presence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this work, researchers show that the SETI Ellipsoid
                    method can leverage continuous, wide-field sky surveys,
                    significantly enhancing our ability to detect these
                    potential signals. By compensating for the uncertainties in
                    the estimated time-of-arrival of such signals using
                    observations that span up to a year, the team implements the
                    SETI Ellipsoid strategy in an innovative way using
                    state-of-the-arc technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In examining data from the TESS continuous viewing
                    zone, covering 5% of all TESS data from the first three
                    years of its mission, researchers utilized the advanced 3D
                    location data from Gaia Early Data Release 3. This analysis
                    identified 32 prime targets within the SETI Ellipsoid in the
                    southern TESS continuous viewing zone, all with
                    uncertainties refined to better than 0.5 light-years. While
                    the initial examination of TESS light curves during the
                    Ellipsoid crossing event revealed no anomalies, the
                    groundwork laid by this initiative paves the way for
                    expanding the search to other surveys, a broader array of
                    targets, and exploring diverse potential signal types.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The SETI Ellipsoid method, combined with Gaia's
                    distance measurements, offers a robust and adaptable
                    framework for future SETI searches. Researchers can
                    retrospectively apply it to sift through archival data for
                    potential signals, proactively select targets, and schedule
                    future monitoring campaigns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "As Dr. Jill Tarter often points out, SETI searches are like
                    looking for a needle in a 9-D haystack," said co-author Dr.
                    Sofia Sheikh. "Any technique that can help us prioritize
                    where to look, such as the SETI Ellipsoid, could potentially
                    give us a shortcut to the most promising parts of the
                    haystack. This work is the first step in searching those
                    newly-highlighted parts of parameter space, and is an
                    exciting precedent for upcoming large survey projects like
                    LSST."

                    A judge has given the go-ahead to a mass legal action
                    against Facebook owner Meta, potentially worth £3bn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The case is being brought by legal academic Dr Liza Lovdahl
                    Gormsen, on behalf of 45 million Facebook users.
                  </p>

                      >Her original claim</a
                    >
                    was refused, in 2023, but a revised version has now been
                    accepted, with early 2026 said to be the latest it could be
                    heard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meta said the claims "remain entirely without merit and we
                    will vigorously defend against them".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new claim says: "Facebook has struck an unfair bargain
                    with its users," according to
                    <a
                      href="https://facebookclaim.co.uk/media/ppab0ndv/cpo-application-and-hearing-notice.pdf"
                      >legal documents</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Facebook abused its dominance by making users give it their
                    data from non-Facebook products, including Meta-owned
                    Instagram and other third-party sites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And sharing data with third parties had become "a condition
                    of accessing the Facebook platform, pursuant to a
                    'take-it-or-leave-it' offer".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Meta said the "fundamental concerns identified by the
                    tribunal in its February 2023 judgement have not been
                    resolved".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was "committed to giving people meaningful control" of
                    the information they shared on its platforms and to "invest
                    heavily to create tools that allow them to do so."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The legal action is being funded by Innsworth, a company
                    backed by an investment management fund, which has also
                    funded mass legal actions against Mastercard, Ericsson and
                    Volkswagen.

                        April 26th 2007, Computer History Museum, Mountain View,

                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Around 1977, Intel released a floppy disc controller
                        (FDC) chip called the 8271. This controller isn't
                        particularly well known. It was mainly used in business
                        computers and storage solutions, but its one
                        breakthrough into the consumer space was with the BBC
                        Micro, a UK-centric computer released in 1981.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        There are very few easily discovered details about this
                        chip online, aside from the useful datasheet. This,
                        combined with increasing observations of strange
                        behavior, make the chip a bit of an enigma. My interest
                        in the chip was piqued when I accidentally triggered a
                        wild test mode that managed to corrupt one of my floppy
                        discs even though the write protect tab was present!

                    A single packet can exhaust the processing capacity of a
                    vulnerable DNS server, effectively disabling the machine, by
                    exploiting a 20-plus-year-old design flaw in the DNSSEC
                    specification.

                  <p>
                    That would make it trivial to take down a DNSSEC-validating
                    DNS resolver that has yet to be patched, upsetting all the
                    clients relying on that service and make it seem as though
                    websites and apps were offline.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The academics who found this flaw – associated with the
                    German National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity
                    (ATHENE) in Darmstadt – claimed DNS server software makers
                    briefed about the vulnerability described it as "the worst
                    attack on DNS ever discovered."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] The researchers said lone DNS packets exploiting
                    KeyTrap could stall public DNSSEC-validated DNS services,
                    such as those provided by Google and Cloudflare, by making
                    them do calculations that overtax server CPU cores.

                  <p>
                    This disruption of DNS could not only deny people's access
                    to content but could also interfere with other systems,
                    including spam defenses, cryptographic defenses (PKI), and
                    inter-domain routing security (RPKI), the researchers
                    assert.

                    The inside of underwater pipes and enclosed nuclear
                    containers were inaccessible—until recently. Acoustics
                    researchers in Penn State's College of Engineering have
                    developed a way to convey energy and transmit communications
                    through metal walls using ultrasound.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They published their innovation, a pillar-based acoustic
                    metamaterial that operates at ultrasound frequency range, in
                    Physical Review Applied. The work could have implications
                    for research in space, according to the researchers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If you wanted to power a device, such as a temperature
                    sensor, inside a metal enclosure like a pipe, ultrasound
                    waves can carry that energy to the device," said Yun Jing,
                    professor of acoustics and biomedical engineering and
                    corresponding author on the paper. "But previously, the
                    waves could not pass through metal barriers that would block
                    sound, unless the transducers were in direct contact with
                    the barrier."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers created a pillar-based metamaterial: an
                    array of tiny, cylindrical pillars positioned on a metal
                    plate that work as resonators, which vibrate or oscillate to
                    create acoustic resonance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the metamaterial is situated between a transducer
                    transmitter and a receiver, it dramatically enhances the
                    ultrasonic power transmission rate through a metal barrier,
                    without requiring direct contact between transducers and the
                    barrier. Previously, faint ultrasound waves could pass
                    through metal, but they lacked sufficient energy to power a
                    sensor or pass messages through the metal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "With a narrow end and a wider end like a pillar, the
                    acoustic metamaterial is designed like an acoustic
                    resonator," said first author Jun Ji, who recently earned
                    his doctorate in acoustics from Penn State. "The shape of
                    the metamaterial allows for a wireless transmission and
                    reception of ultrasound through a metal barrier."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers tested the function of the metamaterial
                    sample in two experiments. In the first, they wirelessly
                    transmitted power through a metal plate with the
                    metamaterial using an ultrasonic transmitter and a receiver,
                    successfully powering an LED light on the other side. This
                    confirmed the metamaterial's ability to transmit power
                    through metal walls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a second test case, they transmitted an image of the
                    letters "PSU" through a metal plate with the metamaterial
                    using encoded ultrasonic signal, confirming that
                    communications are possible with the use of the metamaterial
                    strengthening the transmission of ultrasound waves through
                    metal barriers.

                    Like all organizations, non-profit and corporate boards can
                    fall prey to groupthink, silo effects, or short-term or
                    trendy thinking that ultimately work against the interests
                    of the entity they are entrusted to oversee. A large
                    scientific literature has explored factors affecting board
                    function, from disciplinary and sociodemographic diversity
                    to size and deliberation processes. A less explored factor
                    is how the internal network structure of the board can
                    affect its performance.

                    [...] Boards face challenges, and their problems are not
                    just a function of mis-directed objectives (such as an
                    overly narrow focus on quarterly earnings or fealty to some
                    ideological commitment) nor a function of the
                    self-perpetuating insularity that makes them ignore external
                    pressures or information. Rather, the way many boards
                    themselves are structured may make them less capable of
                    confronting the enduring reality of such stresses. Efforts
                    to make it difficult or impossible for outsiders to join
                    boards (such as happened at Yale a couple of years ago) will
                    only exacerbate such problems.

                    Network insights can provide the right kind of disruption
                    here—the kind that fosters creativity and fiscal
                    stewardship, whether that is by bringing leaders down or
                    keeping planes up.

                    Enea tested this. Via MMS it was able to make the target
                    device perform a GET to an URL on a server it controlled.
                    This HTTP GET exposed the device's <em>UserAgent</em> and
                    <em>x-wap-profile</em> fields. The first identifies the OS
                    and device. The second points to a UAProf (User Agent
                    Profile) file that describes the capabilities of a mobile
                    handset. Enea concealed the process by changing the binary
                    SMS element to be a silent SMS through setting a TP-PID
                    value of 0x40. The result was that no MMS content appears on
                    the targeted device, and the targeted person sees anything
                    on their phone.

                    All of this describes a possible infection route (which is
                    what the NSO contract claims) rather than a specific device
                    exploitation. However, with the information obtained,
                    further attacks are simplified. "Both of these can be very
                    useful for malicious actors," says McDaid. "Attackers could

                    To a degree, this is all theory – but Enea has demonstrated
                    that it is a workable MMS fingerprinting method. The firm
                    has found no indication of it being used in the wild, but
                    notes that it doesn't have visibility into every operator in
                    the world. It can be blocked by the local mobile network,
                    while subscribers could disable MMS auto-retrieval on their
                    handset (as recommended to defend against other MMS exploits

                    figures—which the authors acknowledge in the article's text
                    were made by Midjourney—are all uninterpretable. They
                    contain gibberish text and, most strikingly, one includes an

                    The images, while egregious examples, highlight a growing
                    problem in scientific publishing. A scientist's success
                    relies heavily on their publication record, with a large
                    volume of publications, frequent publishing, and articles
                    appearing in top-tier journals, all of which earn scientists
                    more prestige. The system incentivizes less-than-scrupulous
                    researchers to push through low-quality articles, which, in
                    the era of AI chatbots, could potentially be generated with
                    the help of AI. Researchers worry that the growing use of AI
                    will make published research less trustworthy. As such,
                    research journals have recently set new authorship
                    guidelines for AI-generated text to try to address the
                    problem. But for now, as the Frontiers article shows, there
                    are clearly some gaps.

                It looks like "peer reviewed" is becoming meaningless nowadays.
                However, this attempt is so obviously fake that I cannot see how

                that reveals some new information about the Indo-European
                proto-language:

                <div>
                  <p>
                    Almost half of all people in the world today speak an
                    Indo-European language, one whose origins go back thousands
                    of years to a single mother tongue. Languages as different
                    as English, Russian, Hindustani, Latin, and Sanskrit can all
                    be traced back to this ancestral language.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the last couple of hundred years, linguists have
                    figured out a lot about that first Indo-European language,
                    including many of the words it used and some of the
                    grammatical rules that governed it. Along the way, they've
                    come up with theories about who its original speakers were,
                    where and how they lived, and how their language spread so
                    widely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most linguists think that those speakers were nomadic
                    herders who lived on the steppes of Ukraine and western
                    Russia about 6,000 years ago. Yet a minority put the origin
                    2,000 to 3,000 years before that, with a community of
                    farmers in Anatolia, in the area of modern-day Turkey. Now a
                    new analysis, using techniques borrowed from evolutionary
                    biology, has come down in favor of the latter, albeit with
                    an important later role for the steppes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The computational technique used in the new analysis is
                    hotly disputed among linguists. But its proponents say it
                    promises to bring more quantitative rigor to the field, and
                    could possibly push key dates further into the past, much as
                    radiocarbon dating did in the field of archaeology.

                    [...] "All the satellites which re-enter the Earth's
                    atmosphere burn and create tiny alumina particles, which
                    will float in the upper atmosphere for many years," Takao
                    Doi, a Japanese astronaut and aerospace engineer with Kyoto
                    University, warned recently. "Eventually, it will affect the
                    environment of the Earth."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To tackle the problem, Kyoto researchers set up a project to
                    evaluate types of wood to determine how well they could
                    withstand the rigours of space launch and lengthy flights in
                    orbit round the Earth. The first tests were carried out in
                    laboratories that recreated conditions in space, and wood
                    samples were found to have suffered no measurable changes in
                    mass or signs of decomposition or damage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Wood's ability to withstand these conditions astounded us,"
                    said Koji Murata, head of the project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After these tests, samples were sent to the ISS, where they
                    were subjected to exposure trials for almost a year before
                    being brought back to Earth. Again they showed little signs
                    of damage, a phenomenon that Murata attributed to the fact
                    that there is no oxygen in space which could cause wood to
                    burn, and no living creatures to cause it to rot.

                    The Canary Islands—More than 1000 years ago, a young man
                    stood on the northern shore of the island now known as El
                    Hierro. Across the wave-swept Atlantic Ocean, he could see
                    the silhouettes of other islands, a volcanic peak on one
                    soaring toward the clouds only 90 kilometers away. Yet, for
                    him, those islands were as unreachable as the Moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    His body betrayed the rigors of life on his arid volcanic
                    outcrop. His molars were worn almost to the gums from
                    grinding fibrous wild fern roots. His ancestors here had
                    farmed wheat, but he and his contemporaries grew only barley
                    and raised livestock such as goats. His genes held evidence
                    that his parents were closely related, like many of the
                    roughly 1000 people on the island, who had not mingled with
                    outsiders for centuries. Also like many of his fellow
                    islanders, he bore signs of an old head injury, likely
                    sustained in a fight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This population faced a lot of challenges," says
                    archaeologist Jonathan Santana of the University of Las
                    Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC). "Survival on this island was
                    a challenge every day."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yet the first Canarians, who arrived from North Africa
                    roughly 1800 years ago, survived and even thrived on this
                    arid, windswept archipelago for 1000 years. They numbered in
                    the tens of thousands when Europeans arrived at the start of
                    the 14th century. Not long after, conquest and genocide had
                    largely erased them as a people. But their DNA lives on in
                    many islanders today, and traces of their lives remain, in
                    granaries, cliff dwellings, ceramic figurines, and hundreds
                    of human remains like those of the man on El Hierro—all
                    remarkably well preserved by the dry climate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By applying the latest archaeological tools to this trove of
                    material, Santana and other home-grown archaeologists are
                    unearthing their stories, shedding light on puzzles that
                    have mystified archaeologists since the 19th century. For
                    instance, how did people with no apparent seafaring skills
                    reach and survive on the archipelago? Why did their crops
                    and cultures differ from island to island despite their
                    common origin? The answers offer insights into how human
                    societies cope with—and respond to—challenging environments,
                    says Scott Fitzpatrick, a University of Oregon archaeologist
                    who studies island cultures. "The Canaries have been sort of
                    an enigma."

                      >The state of responsible technology</a

                    seriously. Seventy-three percent of business leaders
                    surveyed, for example, agreed that responsible technology
                    use will come to be as important as business and financial
                    considerations when making technology decisions.

                    This AI moment, however, may represent a unique opportunity
                    to overcome barriers that have previously stalled
                    responsible technology work. Lack of senior management
                    awareness (cited by 52% of those surveyed as a top barrier
                    to adopting responsible practices) is certainly less of a
                    concern today: savvy executives are quickly becoming fluent
                    in this new technology and are continually reminded of its
                    potential consequences, failures, and societal harms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The other top barriers cited were organizational resistance
                    to change (46%) and internal competing priorities (46%).
                    Organizations that have realigned themselves behind a clear
                    AI strategy, and who understand its industry-altering
                    potential, may be able to overcome this inertia and
                    indecision as well. At this singular moment of disruption,
                    when AI provides both the tools and motivation to redesign
                    many of the ways in which we work and live, we can fold
                    responsible technology principles into that transition—if we
                    choose to.

                    Nginx Inc. was acquired by Seattle-based networking firm F5
                    in 2019. Later that year, two of Nginx's leaders, Maxim

                    Dounin technically stopped working for F5 at that point,
                    too, but maintained his role in Nginx "as a volunteer,"
                    according to Dounin's mailing list post.

                    management" at F5 "recently decided that they know better
                    how to run open source projects. In particular, they decided
                    to interfere with security policy nginx uses for years,
                    ignoring both the policy and developers' position." While it
                    was "quite understandable," given their ownership, Dounin
                    wrote that it means he was "no longer able to control which
                    changes are made in nginx," hence his departure and fork.

                  <p>
                    As the last reindeer herds disappeared from our latitudes
                    around 11,000 years ago, when the climate became warmer and
                    forests were spreading, the stone wall was most likely not
                    built after this time. This would make it the oldest human
                    structure ever discovered in the Baltic Sea.<br />Originally,
                    a team of researchers and students from Kiel University
                    (CAU) wanted to investigate manganese crusts on a ridge of
                    basal till that forms the seafloor about 10 kilometers off
                    Rerik in Mecklenburg Bight. During their survey, however,
                    they discovered a 970-meter long regular row of stones.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The structure consists of around 1,500 stones, most some
                    tens of centimeters in diameter, that connect several large
                    meter-scale boulders. The researchers reported their
                    discovery to the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state agency for
                    culture and monument preservation (Landesamt für Kultur und
                    Denkmalpflege Mecklenburg-Vorpommern LAKD M-V), which then
                    coordinated further investigations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The stone wall is located on the southwestern flank of a
                    ridge of basal till trending roughly parallel to an adjacent
                    basin in the South, presumably a former lake or bog. Today,
                    the Baltic Sea is 21 meters deep at this location. Thus, the
                    stone wall must have been built before the sea level rose
                    significantly after the end of the last ice age, which
                    happened around 8,500 years ago. Large parts of the
                    previously accessible landscape ultimately flooded at that
                    time.

                    the chatbot's misleading information because Air Canada

                    24. While Mr. Moffatt does not use the words specifically,
                    by saying they relied on Air Canada's chatbot, I find they
                    are alleging negligent misrepresentation. Negligent
                    misrepresentation can arise when a seller does not exercise
                    reasonable care to ensure its representations are accurate

                Should a company be held to the hallucinations of their AI
                chatbot? This could slow the adoption of AI chatbots that are
                not ready for actual public interaction. It could delay

                    this wasn't the only change to the service. Those who don't

                    on Sunday, Prime Video users who choose to sit through ads
                    can no longer use Dolby Vision or Atmos while streaming.
                    Ad-tier subscribers are limited to HDR10+ and Dolby Digital

                    Vision and Atmos from the ad-supported tier.<br />[...]<br />As
                    Forbes' John Archer reported, "To add a bit of confusion to

                    among the supported technical features—yet when you start to
                    play the episode, neither feature is delivered to the TV."
