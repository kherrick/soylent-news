                    Microsoft's Patch Tuesday for August 2024 includes a fix for
                    a security vulnerability in the Grub2 boot loader, which is
                    used by many Linux operating systems. Tracked as
                    <a
                      href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-2601"
                      >CVE-2022-2601</a
                    >, this flaw, discovered in 2022, could lead to an
                    out-of-bounds write with a potential bypass of
                    <a href="https://www.techspot.com/tag/secure+boot/"
                      >Secure Boot</a
                    >
                    protection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Grub2 boot loader provides compatibility with the Secure
                    Boot technology on PCs running Linux systems. After
                    installing the new patch, Windows applies a Secure Boot
                    Advanced Targeting (SBAT) policy to block vulnerable Linux
                    boot loaders that could compromise OS security.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft explained that the SBAT value would not be applied
                    to dual-boot systems with both Windows and Linux on the boot
                    drive, so the patch was expected not to impact these
                    systems. However, many users with dual-boot configurations
                    have reported that the CVE-2022-2601 update still rendered
                    booting into a Linux OS impossible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The issue appears to affect various Linux distributions,
                    including popular ones such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin OS,
                    Puppy Linux, and others. Affected systems typically display
                    a "Security Policy Violation" error at boot, indicating a
                    failed check on "shim SBAT data." Boot problems have been
                    reported on both dual-boot systems and on Windows devices
                    running Linux from an
                    <a href="https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/issues/2947"
                      >ISO image</a
                    >, USB drive, or optical media.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft's bulletin noted that only older Linux distros'
                    ISOs were expected to experience boot issues following the
                    CVE-2022-2601 patch. However, users with systems released in
                    2024 also seem to be affected. The only reliable way to
                    restore a bootable state appears to be disabling Secure Boot
                    entirely. Alternatively, users can

                    >
                    to remove the SBAT policy introduced by Microsoft this past
                    week.

                    Microsoft will begin sending a revised version of its
                    controversial Recall feature to Windows Insider PCs
                    beginning in October, according to an update published today
                    to the company's original blog post about the Recall
                    controversy. The company didn't elaborate further on
                    specific changes it's making to Recall beyond what it
                    already announced in June.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For those unfamiliar, Recall is a Windows service that runs
                    in the background on compatible PCs, continuously taking
                    screenshots of user activity, scanning those screenshots
                    with optical character recognition (OCR), and saving the OCR
                    text and the screenshots to a giant searchable database on
                    your PC. The goal, according to Microsoft, is to help users
                    retrace their steps and dig up information about things they
                    had used their PCs to find or do in the past.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem was that other users on the same PC, or
                    attackers with physical or remote access to your PC, could
                    easily access, view, and export those screenshots and the
                    OCR database since none of the information was encrypted at
                    rest or protected in any substantive way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft had planned to launch Recall as one of the
                    flagship features of its Copilot+ PC launch in July, along
                    with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered Surface devices,
                    but its rollout was bumped back and then paused entirely so
                    that Recall could be reworked and then sent out to Windows
                    Insiders for testing like most other Windows features are.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among the changes Microsoft has said it will make: The
                    database will be encrypted at rest and will require
                    authentication (and periodic reauthentication) with Windows
                    Hello before users will be allowed to access it. The feature
                    will also be off by default, whereas the original plan was
                    to turn it on by default and make users go into Settings to
                    turn it off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Security continues to be our top priority and when Recall
                    is available for Windows Insiders in October we will publish
                    a blog with more details," reads today's update to Microsoft
                    Windows and Devices Corporate Vice President Pavan
                    Davuluri's blog post.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the preview is released, Windows Insiders who want to
                    test the Recall preview will need to do it on a PC that
                    meets Microsoft's Copilot+ system requirements. Those
                    include a processor with a neural processing unit (NPU)
                    capable of at least 40 trillion operations per second
                    (TOPS), 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The x86 builds of
                    Windows for Intel and AMD processors don't currently support
                    any Copilot+ features regardless of whether the PC meets
                    those requirements, but that should change later this year.

                    Chen says that similar reactors have been tested before, but
                    the electrodes could not shuffle charges at a sufficient
                    voltage for the reaction to work – unless

                    were added to the wastewater. He and his colleagues made
                    their device more practical by filling its middle chamber
                    with a porous material that plays the role of those salts,
                    so wastewater can be fed directly into the reactor without
                    additives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In experiments with water samples that had realistic
                    concentrations of nitrates, the reactor processed 100
                    millilitres in about an hour, and it kept working well when
                    it ran for 10 days straight. Its performance is similar to
                    that of previous, more complicated reactor designs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team has only tested the reactor in the lab using
                    nitrate-rich water, not real wastewater samples, which
                    contain more than just nitrates, says Chen. But the
                    researchers eventually envision local businesses and farms
                    using these reactors to recycle wastewater, instead of
                    sending it to far-away treatment plants that waste its
                    ammonia-making potential.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the best-case scenario, a farm might have its own
                    reactor, powered by solar or wind power. Farmers could run
                    local wastewater through the device and immediately

                    GRAS ingredients support the safety of our food supply,”

                    “As a result of the FDA’s policy, the food industry has been
                    free to ‘self-GRAS’ new substances they wish to add to
                    foods, without notifying FDA or the public,” said study
                    senior author Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is
                    Medicine Institute and distinguished professor at the
                    Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts
                    University. “There are now hundreds, if not thousands, of
                    substances added to our foods for which the true safety data
                    are unknown to independent scientists, the government, and

                    According to the researchers, the FDA also lacks a formal
                    approach and adequate resources to review those food
                    additives and GRAS substances already on the market. After
                    an ingredient is added to foods, if research later suggests

                    in March that it would be reviewing 21 chemicals found in

                    the thousands of food additives and GRAS substances used

                  <p>
                    An example of the 21 food additives to be reviewed is
                    potassium bromate, a chemical added to baked goods and
                    drinks with evidence that it may cause cancer. Potassium

                    “This is a stark example of the FDA’s regulatory gap,” said
                    Pomeranz. “We’re seeing states starting to act to fill the
                    regulatory void left by the FDA’s inaction over substances
                    increasingly associated with harm.”

                    The FDA’s oversight of GRAS ingredients on the market is
                    also limited. The agency rarely revokes GRAS designation (<a

                    only shows 15 substances that were considered GRAS and then
                    later determined to not be), nor does the FDA review foods
                    on an ongoing basis with GRAS ingredients that can be safe
                    when added at low levels but not in large quantities—for
                    instance, caffeine, salt, and sugar.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “In 1977, the FDA approved caffeine as a GRAS substance for
                    use in sodas at a low level: 0.02 percent,” said Pomeranz.
                    “But today, caffeine is added to energy drinks at levels far
                    exceeding this, which is causing caffeine-related
                    hospitalizations and even deaths. Given that the FDA
                    regulates the use of GRAS substances, the agency could set
                    limits on the amount of caffeine in energy drinks.”

                    find more opportunities for efficiency, a GM spokesperson
                    told the DCNF [Daily Caller News Foundataion]. Monday's job
                    cuts followed a decision by the two new GM executives from
                    Apple, Baris Cetinok and Dave Richardson, to streamline the
                    service and software business, sources familiar with the

                    would be affected at the company's global technical center
                    in Warren, Michigan.

                    Earlier this year, several authors sued NVIDIA over alleged
                    copyright infringement. The class action lawsuit alleged
                    that the company's AI models were trained on copyrighted
                    works and specifically mentioned Books3 data. Since this
                    happened without permission, the rightsholders demand
                    compensation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit was followed up by a near-identical case a few
                    weeks later, and NVIDIA plans to challenge both in court by
                    denying the copyright infringement allegations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In its initial response, filed a few weeks ago, NVIDIA did
                    not deny that it used the Books3 dataset. Like many other AI
                    companies, it believes that the use of copyrighted data for
                    AI training is a prime example of fair use; especially when
                    the output of the model doesn't reproduce copyrighted works.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The authors clearly have a different take. They allege that
                    NVIDIA willingly copied an archive of pirated books to train
                    its commercial AI model, and are demanding damages for
                    direct copyright infringement.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    [...] NVIDIA also shared its early outlook on the case. The
                    company believes that AI companies should be allowed to use
                    copyrighted books to train their AI models, as these books
                    are made up of "uncopyrightable facts and ideas" that are
                    already in the public domain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The argument may seem surprising at first; the authors own
                    copyrights and as far they're concerned, use of pirated
                    copies leads to liability as a direct infringer. However,
                    NVIDIA goes on to explain that their AI models don't see
                    these works that way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AI training doesn't involve any book reading skills, or even
                    a basic understanding of a storyline. Instead, it simply
                    measures statistical correlations and adds these to the
                    model.

                An interesting article about why legalese is written the way it
                is:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    A new study shows lawyers find simplified legal documents
                    easier to understand, more appealing, and just as
                    enforceable as traditional contracts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's no secret that legal documents are notoriously
                    difficult to understand, causing headaches for anyone who
                    has had to apply for a mortgage or review any other kind of
                    contract. A new MIT study reveals that the lawyers who
                    produce these documents don't like them very much either.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers found that while lawyers can interpret and
                    recall information from legal documents better than
                    nonlawyers, it's still easier for them to understand the
                    same documents when translated into "plain English." Lawyers
                    also rated plain English contracts as higher-quality
                    overall, more likely to be signed by a client, and equally
                    enforceable as those written in "legalese."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings suggest that while impenetrable styles of legal
                    writing are well-entrenched, lawyers may be amenable to
                    changing the way such documents are written.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "No matter how we asked the questions, the lawyers
                    overwhelmingly always wanted plain English," says Edward
                    Gibson, an MIT professor of brain and cognitive sciences and
                    the senior author of the study. "People blame lawyers, but I
                    don't think it's their fault. They would like to change it,
                    too."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eric Martínez, an MIT graduate student and licensed
                    attorney, is the lead author of the new study, which appears
                    this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
                    Sciences. Frank Mollica, a former visiting researcher at MIT
                    who is now a lecturer in computational cognitive science at
                    the University of Edinburgh, is also an author of the
                    <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2302672120"

                    Finding a total of 332 instances of identifying information
                    profiles on those sites, Consumer Reports found that only
                    117 profiles were removed within four months using all the
                    services, or 35 percent. The services varied in efficacy,
                    with EasyOptOuts notably performing the second-best at a 65
                    percent removal rate after four months. But if your goal is
                    to remove entirely others' ability to find out about you, no
                    service Consumer Reports tested truly gets you there.

                  <p>
                    Manual opt-outs were the most effective removal method, at
                    70 percent removed within one week, which is both a higher
                    elimination rate and quicker turn-around than all the
                    automated services.

                    [...] As Chicken Soup sorts through its debts and
                    liquidation, customers are left without guidance about what
                    to do with their rental DVDs or how they can access
                    movies/shows they purchased. But when it comes to purchases
                    made via streaming services, it's more accurate to consider
                    them rentals, despite them not being labeled as such and
                    costing more than rentals with set time limits. As we've
                    seen before, streaming companies can quickly yank away
                    content that people feel that they paid to own, be it due to

                    [...] The researchers said the findings, published in the
                    journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science, suggests horses
                    have the ability to form an internal model of the world
                    around them to make decisions and predictions, a technique
                    known as model-based learning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was previously thought that model-based learning was too
                    complex for horses because they have an underdeveloped
                    pre-frontal cortex, a part of the brain associated with
                    strategic thinking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr Ijichi said this suggests that the hoses "must be using
                    another area of the brain to achieve a similar result".

                    She said: "This teaches us that we shouldn't make
                    assumptions about animal intelligence or sentience based on
                    whether they are 'built' just like us."

                    bad news for uBlock Origin.

                      >PCWorld</a
                    >, Chrome's shift from Manifest V2 to V3 is deprecating
                    certain features that the popular ad-blocker relies on. The
                    Chrome update "aims to... improve the privacy, security, and
                    performance of extensions," by changing the way it manages
                    API requests. That means with the upcoming Chrome update,
                    uBlock Origin will be automatically disabled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The popular ad-blocker, which has over 30 million
                    users, reportedly still works. But a disclaimer at the top
                    of extension page says, "This extension may soon no longer
                    be supported because it doesn't follow best practices for
                    Chrome extensions."

                    Developer Raymond Hill who makes uBlock Origin has scrambled
                    to deploy a fix and now offers

                      >uBlock Origin Lite</a

                    200,000 users, and still has standard ad-blocking
                    capabilities, but is less dynamic in the sense that it
                    requires the user to allow or block permissions on a
                    "per-site basis." In a GitHub

                    >
                    about the new extension, Hill explained that it isn't
                    intended to be a replacement for the original.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I consider uBO Lite to be too different from uBO to be an
                    automatic replacement," said the developer. "You will have
                    to explicitly find a replacement to uBO according to what
                    you expect from a content blocker. uBO Lite may or may not
                    fulfill your expectations."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    uBlock Origin still works on other browsers, so you could
                    always switch to a Chrome alternative like Firefox or Edge.
                    But if you want to stick with Chrome, you have to play by
                    Chrome's rules, and that means getting a different
                    ad-blocker.

                    Typically, the ratio between high alcohol groups and lager
                    ester amounts ranges between 3-4:1, with higher ratios
                    offering a drier, less aromatic beer. The team recorded
                    their control samples as having a ratio of 1.4:1, while
                    their microgravity beer measured 4.6:1, implying the latter
                    was "less aromatic by this measure." Meanwhile, two esters
                    in particular, isoamyl acetate and 2-phenethyl acetate,
                    showed "significant differences" between microgravity and
                    controls. Higher concentrations of these esters produce a
                    fruity, banana-like flavor in beers that many drinkers often
                    consider undesirable. In the microgravity brews, a
                    "multiple-fold decrease" in ester concentration compared to
                    the standard examples.

                  <p>
                    "Depending upon the brewery, these compounds may be
                    desirable; however, the presence of these compounds above a
                    detection threshold would usually be considered a defect,"
                    the team writes. Given this, their microgravity results
                    offered a final product "that would be considered higher
                    quality due to the reduced esters.

                    "Operation of the 2×2 prototype in a neutrino beam will
                    usher in a new era of high-fidelity, inherently 3D LArTPC
                    images for neutrino interaction measurements," Russell said.

                    The final version of the DUNE near detector will feature 35
                    liquid argon modules, each larger than those in the
                    prototype. The modules will help navigate the enormous flux
                    of neutrinos expected at the near site.

                  <p>
                    The 2×2 prototype implements novel technologies that enable
                    a new regime of detailed, cutting-edge neutrino imaging to
                    handle the unique conditions in DUNE. It has a
                    millimeter-sized pixel readout system, developed by a team
                    at Berkeley Lab, that allows for high-precision 3D imaging
                    on a large scale. This, coupled with its modular design,
                    sets the prototype apart from previous neutrino detectors
                    like ICARUS and MicroBooNE.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, the 2×2 prototype provides the first
                    accelerator-neutrino data to be analyzed and published by
                    the DUNE collaboration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    DUNE is split between two locations hundreds of miles apart:
                    A beam of neutrinos originating at Fermilab, close to
                    Chicago, will pass through a particle detector located on
                    the Fermilab site, then travel 800 miles through the ground
                    to several huge detectors at the Sanford Underground
                    Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The DUNE detector at Fermilab will analyze the neutrino beam
                    close to its origin, where the beam is extremely intense.
                    Collaborators expect this near detector to record about 50
                    interactions per pulse, which will come every second,
                    amounting to hundreds of millions of neutrino detections
                    over DUNE's many expected years of operation. Scientists
                    will also use DUNE to study neutrinos' antimatter
                    counterpart, antineutrinos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This unprecedented flux of accelerator-made neutrinos and
                    antineutrinos will enable DUNE's ambitious science goals.
                    Physicists will study the particles with DUNE's near and far
                    detectors to learn more about how they change type as they
                    travel, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. By
                    looking for differences between neutrino oscillations and
                    antineutrino oscillations, physicists will seek evidence for
                    a broken symmetry known as CP violation to determine whether
                    neutrinos might be responsible for the prevalence of matter
                    in our universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The DUNE collaboration is made up of more than 1,400
                    scientists and engineers from over 200 research
                    institutions. Nearly 40 of these institutions work on the
                    near detector. Specifically, the hardware development of the
                    2×2 prototype was led by the University of Bern in
                    Switzerland, DOE's Fermilab, Berkeley Lab, and SLAC National
                    Accelerator Laboratory, with significant contributions from
                    many universities.

                    There's many legends in computer history. But a legend is
                    nothing but a story. Someone tells it, someone else
                    remembers it, and everybody passes it on. And the Apple IIGS
                    has a legend all its own. Here, in Userlandia, we're going
                    to bust some megahertz myths.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I love the Apple IIGS. It's the fabulous home computer you'd
                    have to be crazy to hate. One look at its spec sheet will
                    tell you why. The Ensoniq synthesizer chip brings 32 voices
                    of polyphonic power to the desktop. Apple's Video Graphics
                    Controller paints beautiful on-screen pictures from a
                    palette of thousands of colors. Seven slots and seven ports
                    provide plenty of potential for powerful peripherals. These
                    ingredients make a great recipe for a succulent home
                    computer. But you can't forget the most central ingredient:
                    the central processing unit. It's a GTE 65SC816 clocked at
                    2.8 MHz—about 2.72 times faster than an Apple IIe. When the
                    IIGS launched in September 1986 its contemporaries were
                    systems like the Atari 1040ST, the Commodore Amiga 1000, and
                    of course Apple's own Macintosh Plus. These machines all
                    sported a Motorola 68000 clocked between 7 and 8 MHz. If I
                    know anything about which number is bigger than the other
                    number, I'd say that Motorola's CPU is faster.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Now hold on there," you say! "Megahertz is just the clock
                    speed of the chip—it says nothing about how many
                    instructions are actually executed during those cycles, let
                    alone the time spent reading and writing to RAM!" And you
                    know what, that's true! The Apple II and Commodore 64 with
                    their 6502 and 6510 CPUs clocked at 1 MHz could trade blows
                    with Z80 powered computers running at three times the clock
                    speed. And the IIGS had the 6502's 16-bit descendant: the
                    65C816. Steve Wozniak thought Western Design Center had
                    something special with that chip.

                    Crucially, said Fischer-Gödde, the result is different to
                    the composition generally found on Earth, ruling out a
                    theory that the presence of ruthenium and other metals such
                    as osmium and platinum, are down to past eruptions of the
                    Deccan Traps volcanoes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team also cast doubt on the possibility that the
                    impactor was a comet, saying the ruthenium isotope
                    composition of the samples is different to that of
                    meteorites thought to be fragments of comets that have lost
                    their ice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Fischer-Gödde said C-type asteroids can today be found
                    in the asteroid belt that sits between Mars and Jupiter
                    because, not long after the formation of the solar system,
                    Jupiter migrated, scattering asteroids in the process.

                  <p>
                    As a result, he suggests the ill-fated space rock probably
                    came from there.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Maybe there was a collision of two asteroid bodies in the
                    belt, and then this chunk kind of went on an Earth-crossing
                    orbit. That could be one scenario," he said, although he
                    noted there are other possibilities, including that it came
                    from the Oort cloud that is thought to surround the solar
                    system.

                    In 1983, the home video game console market crashed bringing
                    many companies to fold. After the dust settled, Nintendo
                    emerged as a phoenix from the flames with their iconic
                    Famicom, known outside of Japan as the Nintendo
                    Entertainment System (NES). The NES went on to sell in
                    excess of 60 million units and brought about the third
                    generation of console gaming. The success in 2016 of the NES
                    Classic goes to show how popular the console and its games
                    still are. While it may not have been obvious at the time,
                    understanding the scope of IP rights may have helped to make
                    this possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the aspiring home console manufacturer in the early
                    1980s, there were really only two options when considering
                    what microprocessor to use. The first option was the Zilog
                    Z80, most notably used by the ColecoVision and the Sega
                    Master System. The second option was the MOS Technology
                    6502, which was being used by the Atari 2600 (in the
                    stripped-down form of the 6507), the Commodore 64, and
                    numerous arcade games. When Masayuki Uemura, then head of
                    Nintendo's R+D2 team, was presented with these options
                    whilst developing the Famicom, he opted for the 6502.
                    Although an official justification for this choice has never
                    been given, a cursory glance at the patents for the two
                    chips reveals that the decision may have been driven, at
                    least in part, by patent protection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the NES finally hit US shores in October of 1985, very
                    little was known about the technical specification of the
                    console. All that was known was that the NES was powered by
                    a hitherto unknown processor called the Ricoh 2A03. The most
                    notable thing about the 2A03 was that its instruction set
                    was almost identical to the 6502. Put another way, if you
                    could program for the 6502, you could program for the 2A03.
                    But the 2A03 wasn't a 6502, if it was then Nintendo would
                    have had to get some kind of agreement from MOS Technology
                    in order to use it. No such agreement was in place.

                    Mercedes-Benz has been approved to conduct Level 4 automated
                    driving testing on designated roads and highways in Beijing,
                    focusing on the research and development of multi-sensor
                    perception and system performance for advanced autonomous
                    driving systems. This initiative is part of the company's
                    broader technology research efforts in the region, with the
                    goal of exploring the integration of perception and control
                    mechanisms in autonomous vehicles.<br />[...]<br />The
                    company's L4 test vehicles are designed to handle most
                    driving tasks independently, without the need for driver
                    intervention. Equipped with an array of sensors and
                    redundant systems for enhanced safety, the company says
                    these vehicles are capable of executing maneuvers in busy
                    urban environments, such as parking, making U-turns,
                    navigating traffic circles and performing unprotected left
                    turns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On expressways, the vehicles can autonomously change lanes
                    when the vehicle ahead slows down and can pass through toll
                    stations. In extreme situations, the vehicles are programmed
                    to follow a minimal risk strategy, safely stopping in a
                    secure location, according to Mercedes.

                Kudos to Mercedes for jumping from Level 2 directly to L4. L3
                requires that the driver stay alert and be prepared to take
                control at any time...something that humans are notoriously bad
                at doing.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of my first reactions when I read the SAE scheme (years ago)
                was: while L3 is a logical development step (in terms of
                incremental technology improvements), in the real world it
                should never be allowed on public roads.

                    In the realm of messaging apps and services, it's pretty
                    easy to get lost in a sea of the same. Just about every
                    service claims to be the most secure, the most
                    user-friendly, and the most private. But are they… really?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team behind a new messaging app/service reached out to
                    me to introduce their product called <a
                      href="https://getsession.org/"
                      >Session</a
                    >. According to the Session site, "Session is an end-to-end
                    encrypted messenger that minimizes sensitive metadata,
                    designed and built for people who want absolute privacy and
                    freedom from any form of surveillance."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, I was skeptical, but when I installed the app and
                    set it up, I realized I was dealing with something
                    different. With Session, there's no phone number, account
                    name, or footprint to be had. Session uses an onion routing
                    network to ensure you leave no trace, so it's simply
                    impossible for anyone to create a profile based on metadata
                    or account information. All accounts are completely
                    anonymous, and zero data is collected, which means there's
                    absolutely nothing to leak.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When you install the app, you create an account; the
                    only thing associated with that account is the Account ID.
                    Copy that ID and share it with anyone you'd like to chat
                    with and get to the communication, knowing everything is
                    secured with end-to-end encryption, and none of your
                    personal information is shared or saved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] During account creation, you do have to enter a
                    display name, but you're not required to use your real name.
                    You can also choose between fast and slow notification
                    modes. The fast mode uses Google's notification servers, and
                    the slow mode means Session will occasionally check for new
                    messages in the background. Session recommends using the
                    fast mode, but if I had to guess, I would assume the slow
                    mode to be the most private.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Session is still in its infancy, and few people know
                    about this app/service. For anyone trying to escape the
                    usual concerns that their information will be leaked, you
                    can trust that this is less likely to happen with Session
                    than with many other options. Even if your information was
                    leaked, the only thing hackers could get would be your
                    Account ID, as there's no other information tied to your
                    account. And with all communication secured with E2E, even
                    your chats would be hard to view.

                    Canonical recently announced a significant policy change
                    regarding Linux adoption in the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techspot.com/downloads/6445-ubuntu.html"
                      >Ubuntu operating system</a
                    >. The Canonical Kernel Team (CKT), responsible for handling
                    kernel-related issues for any Ubuntu release, will soon
                    begin integrating the latest version of the Linux kernel,
                    even if there is no final stable build out in the wild yet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the British company

                      href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/kernel-version-selection-for-ubuntu-releases/47007?u=d0od"
                      >explains</a
                    >, Ubuntu follows a strict, time-based release schedule.
                    Release dates are set six months in advance, and only in
                    "extreme" circumstances can a delay occur. The most recent
                    long-term support version of Ubuntu, 24.04 "Noble Numbat,"
                    was released in April 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, developers working on the Linux kernel follow a
                    "loosely time-based release process," with a new major
                    kernel release occurring every two to three months. The
                    actual release date for each new version is described as
                    "fluid," meaning that project leader Linus Torvalds may
                    adjust the upstream development process if a significant bug
                    is discovered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A stable release cadence is crucial for maintaining a
                    reliable operating system, explains Canonical's Brett
                    Grandbois. Ubuntu isn't just your weird uncle's experimental
                    Linux OS used by hobbyists; it is officially available in
                    multiple editions, including desktop environments, servers,
                    cloud data centers, and IoT devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "To provide users with the absolute latest in features
                    and hardware support, Ubuntu will now ship the latest
                    available version of the upstream Linux kernel at the
                    specified Ubuntu release freeze date," Canonical stated,
                    even if that kernel is still in Release Candidate (RC)
                    status and some bugs remain to be resolved before the final
                    release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This new "aggressive kernel version commitment policy"
                    carries risks, as RC releases are not considered final by
                    Torvalds and his team for a reason. However, Canonical will
                    need to manage these risks by providing official support for
                    the specific Linux release included in the new Ubuntu
                    version. Updating the kernel after the release is done isn't
                    feasible either, as the Linux edition shipped with Ubuntu is
                    a largely optimized kernel with specific features, patches
                    and hardware support provided by Canonical and its OEM
                    partners.

                    Inland Fisheries in Berlin found that certain microfungi can
                    survive exclusively on plastics, degrading them into simpler
                    forms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While this is a promising breakthrough, especially when it
                    comes to tackling oceanic plastic pollution, experts
                    cautioned that it is not a silver bullet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers observed that microfungi in Lake Stechlin in
                    northeastern Germany can thrive on synthetic polymers
                    without any other carbon source.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The most surprising finding of our work is that our fungi
                    could exclusively grow on some of the synthetic polymers and
                    even form biomass," Hans-Peter Grossart, the lead
                    researcher, told Reuters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Researchers said the fungi's ability to break down
                    plastic may have evolved in response to the overwhelming
                    presence of the synthetic material in their environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These fungi are particularly effective at breaking down
                    polyurethane, a common material used in construction foam,
                    among other products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While the discovery of plastic-eating fungi is a step
                    forward, it is unlikely to solve the plastic pollution
                    problem on its own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Experts said the most effective way to tackle plastic
                    pollution is to reduce the amount of material entering the
                    environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Care must be taken with potential solutions of this
                    sort, which could give the impression that we should worry
                    less about plastic pollution because any plastic leaking
                    into the environment will quickly, and ideally safely,
                    degrade. Yet, for the vast majority of plastics, this is not
                    the case," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The global production of plastic has skyrocketed from
                    1.7 million tonnes in 1950 to 400 million tonnes in 2022,
                    according to Statista. And despite increased efforts, only
                    nine per cent of plastic waste is recycled worldwide,
                    reports the UN.

                    Jamming wireless shifters with that toolkit would be
                    considerably easier than even replay attacks, the
                    researchers say. While a jamming attack could prevent a
                    specific rider from shifting gears if a hacker were able to
                    first pick up one of their wireless shifting signals, a
                    saboteur could also simply broadcast a jamming signal at the
                    frequency used by all Shimano shifters, potentially
                    disrupting a large group of racers. The researchers even say
                    that it would be possible to read the shifting signals from
                    an entire peloton of cyclists and then jam everyone
                    <em>except</em> a chosen rider. "You can basically jam
                    everyone except you," says Northeastern professor Aanjhan
                    Ranganathan, another author of the paper.

                    [...] Exactly how the patch will be deployed to customers
                    isn't quite clear either. The company writes that "riders
                    can perform a firmware update on the rear derailleur" using
                    Shimano's E-TUBE Cyclist smartphone app. But it fails to
                    mention whether the fix will apply to the front derailleur.
                    "More information about this process and steps riders can
                    take to update their Di2 systems will be available shortly,"
                    it concludes.

                    [...] In the ruthless world of competitive cycling, which
                    has been rocked to its foundations in recent decades by
                    doping scandals, they argue that rivals hacking each others'
                    shifters is not at all a far-fetched scenario. "This is, in
                    our opinion, a different kind of doping," says Fernandes.
                    "It leaves no trace, and it allows you to cheat in the
                    sport."

                  <p>
                    More broadly, they argue that their radio-based bike hacking
                    research is a cautionary tale about the temptation to add
                    wireless electronic features to every technology, from

                    long-term trend—namely, that they've all become vulnerable
                    to forms of replay and jamming attacks of the kind that
                    Shimano is now scrambling to fix.

                    "This is a repeating pattern," says Northeastern's
                    Ranganathan, who has also developed solutions for replay
                    attacks on cars' keyless entry systems. "When manufacturers
                    start putting in wireless features in their products, it has
                    an impact on real-world control systems. And that can cause
                    real physical harm."

                    the very next month. That March, Google paused the creation
                    of new Russia-based AdSense accounts and blocked ads
                    globally that originated from Russia. In March 2022, Google
                    also paused monetization of any content exploiting,
                    condoning, or dismissing Russia's war with Ukraine.
                    Seemingly as retaliation, Russia seized Google's bank

                    March—banning advertising on websites, blogs, social
                    networks, or any other online sources published by a

                    in February—perhaps influenced Google's update. The law also
                    prohibited foreign agents from placing ads on sites, and
                    under the law, foreign agents could include anti-Kremlin
                    politicians, activists, and media. With new authority,
                    Russia may have further retaliated against Google,
                    potentially forcing Google to give up the last bit of
                    monetization available to Russia-based creators increasingly
                    censored online.

                    State assembly member and Putin ally Vyacheslav Volodin said
                    that the law was needed to stop financing "scoundrels"
                    allegedly "killing our soldiers, officers, and civilians,"
                    Reuters reported.

                    [...] As Google has tried to resist pressure from Russian
                    lawmakers to censor content that officials deem illegal,
                    such as content supporting Ukraine or condemning Russia,
                    YouTube had become one of the last bastions of online free
                    speech, Reuters reported. It's unclear how ending
                    monetization in the region will impact access to
                    anti-Kremlin reporting on YouTube or more broadly online in
                    Russia. Last February, a popular journalist with 1.64
                    million subscribers on YouTube, Katerina Gordeeva, wrote on
                    Telegram that "she was suspending her work due to the law,"
                    Reuters reported.

                    "We will no longer be able to work as before," Gordeeva
                    said. "Of course, we will look for a way out."

                    In 2002, after a Pentagon news briefing, the then US
                    secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld was
                    <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3254852.stm"
                      >widely ridiculed</a

                    for his thoughts about knowledge. Discussing the issue of
                    whether Iraq was supplying weapons of mass destruction to
                    terrorists, he said:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know
                    we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to
                    say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there
                    are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don't know we don't
                    know.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rumsfeld was describing a world characterised by
                    uncertainty, insecurity and ambiguity. And he actually made
                    a valid point about how leaders face situations where
                    complete knowledge is not, and cannot be, available.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This awareness of a lack of knowledge is something we call a
                    state of "unknowingness". And
                    <a
                      href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00187267231218630"
                      >our research suggests</a
                    >
                    , perhaps surprisingly, that it can be a good thing for
                    leaders and the organisations they run.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] We also found that if "unknowingness" is recognised
                    and accepted, it can lead to better decision making across
                    an organisation – and improved leadership overall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But any organisation which has to deal with "unknowns"
                    (whether they are known or unknown) would benefit from
                    recognising and accepting these particular challenges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There may be little they can do about the things they don't
                    even know they don't know about yet. But when they are aware
                    of the absence of knowledge, and accept an inability to know
                    everything or always make the "right" decision,
                    <a
                      href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00187267231218630"

                    Publishing their results in
                    <em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em>, the scientists
                    describe using a large language model—an AI tool like the
                    one that powers ChatGPT—to engineer a version of a
                    bacteria-killing drug that was previously toxic in humans,
                    so that it would be safe to use.

                    The prognosis for patients with dangerous bacterial
                    infections has worsened in recent years as
                    antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains spread and the
                    development of new treatment options has stalled. However,
                    UT researchers say AI tools are game-changing.

                    [...] Large language models, or LLMs, were originally
                    designed to generate and explore sequences of text, but
                    scientists are finding creative ways to apply these models
                    to other domains. For example, just as sentences are made up
                    of sequences of words, proteins are made up of sequences of
                    amino acids. LLMs cluster together words that share common
                    attributes (such as cat, dog, and hamster) in what’s known
                    as an “embedding space” with thousands of dimensions.
                    Similarly, proteins with similar functions, like the ability
                    to fight off dangerous bacteria without hurting the people
                    who host said bacteria, may cluster together in their own
                    version of an AI embedding space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The space containing all molecules is enormous,” said
                    Davies, co-senior author of the new paper. “Machine learning
                    allows us to find the areas of chemical space that have the
                    properties we’re interested in, and it can do it so much
                    more quickly and thoroughly than standard one-at-a-time lab
                    approaches.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For this project, the researchers employed AI to identify
                    ways to reengineer an existing antibiotic called Protegrin-1
                    that is great at killing bacteria, but toxic to people.
                    Protegrin-1, which is naturally produced by pigs to combat
                    infections, is part of a subtype of antibiotics called
                    antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). AMPs generally kill bacteria
                    directly by disrupting cell membranes, but many target both
                    bacterial and human cell membranes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, the researchers used
                    <a
                      href="https://cns.utexas.edu/news/research/promise-new-antibiotics-lies-shackling-tiny-toxic-tetherballs-bacteria"
                      >a high-throughput method they had previously developed</a
                    >
                    to create more than 7,000 variations of Protegrin-1 and
                    quickly identify areas of the AMP that could be modified
                    without losing its antibiotic activity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, they trained a protein LLM on these results so that
                    the model could evaluate millions of possible variations for
                    three features: selectively targeting bacterial membranes,
                    potently killing bacteria and not harming human red blood
                    cells to find those that fell in the sweet spot of all
                    three. The model then helped guide the team to a safer, more
                    effective version of Protegrin-1, which they dubbed
                    bacterially selective Protegrin-1.2 (bsPG-1.2).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mice infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria and treated
                    with bsPG-1.2 were much less likely to have detectable
                    bacteria in their organs six hours after infection, compared
                    to untreated mice. If further testing offers similarly
                    positive results, the researchers hope eventually to take a
                    version of the AI-informed antibiotic drug into human
                    trials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Machine learning’s impact is twofold,” Davies said. “It’s
                    going to point out new molecules that could have the
                    potential to help people, and it’s going to show us how we
                    can take those existing antibiotic molecules and make them
                    better and focus our work to more quickly get those to
                    clinical practice.”

                in nearly every city, places where people were promised food and
                shelter while employment was scarce, but quickly became
                overcrowded and with poor living conditions. The general public
                is mostly unaware of the conditions within the sanctuary
                districts, whose residents are prevented from leaving and have
                largely been forgotten. The residents are referred to by slang
                terms of
                <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Gimmie"
                  >gimmies</a

                (people who struggled to integrate and joined gangs). During the
                Bell Riots, some ghosts and other residents overpowered the
                guards, took hostages, and seized control of the sanctuary's
                processing center for incoming residents. Despite rumors that
                the hostages had been killed,
                <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Gabriel_Bell"
                  >Gabriel Bell</a
                >
                prevented this from happening. Bell was able to broadcast from
                the district and inform the public of the living conditions
                within the district, which brought the living conditions to the
                general public's attention and spurred on reforms.

                However, when Sisko is attacked on August 31 by a gang of
                ghosts, Gabriel Bell is killed by a ghost named B.C. while
                trying to help Sisko fend off off the attackers. This alters the
                timeline, and Sisko assumes the role of Bell to try to restore
                the proper course of history. There is no longer a Federation in
                the 24th century, no evidence of advanced technology on Earth,
                and there is a Romulan outpost at Alpha Centuary. Chief O'Brien
                and Major Kira use the transporters to travel back in time to a
                few points in history to try to find the missing crew members
                and restore the timeline. The episode's script includes this
                dialogue:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    <b>O'BRIEN:</b> Well, we know one thing. They arrived before
                    the year twenty forty eight.<br /><b>ODO:</b> How can you be
                    sure?<br /><b>O'BRIEN:</b> Because we were just there. And
                    that wasn't the mid-twenty first century I read about in
                    school. It's been changed. I mean, Earth history has been
                    through its rough patches, but never that rough.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                In the Star Trek universe, 2048 occurs within
                <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/World_War_III"
                  >World War III</a
                >, which includes the use of strategic nuclear weapons by the
                United States, China, and Russia. This leads to a nuclear winter
                and the collapse of society. Past Tense was written to examine
                the issue of homelessness, specifically that homeless people are
                moved out of view of the general public and are forgotten about.
                There is a contrast of the extreme wealth of people like Chris
                Brynner and the destitution in the sanctuary districts. The
                story also serves as a warning that failing to address societal
                inequality may lead to more severe problems in the future, in
                this case making WWIII and the societal collapse far worse. One
                of the writers, Ira Steven Behr, commented that B.C. is not
                viewed as a murderer despite killing the real Gabriel Bell
                because society forced him into the situation, and he was just
                trying to survive the conditions in the sanctuary district. In
                2021, writer Robert Hewitt Wolfe said about the episode:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    "As a writer, all you can do is be a voice in the
                    wilderness, sometimes. You can yell, 'Fire!' but you can't
                    put it out. It's disappointing that we're still grappling
                    with this problem. I certainly would have hoped it would be
                    better by now, and people would be like, 'Ha! Remember that
                    Deep Space Nine episode that said homelessness would still
                    be a problem in the 2020s? They were so gloomy!' But one of
                    the themes of the show is that paradise doesn't come for
                    free. Even if it does get handed to you, you have to
                    continually work to protect it and renew it and advance it."
                  </p>
                </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Deep Space Nine is my favorite of all of the Star Trek series,
                and these are two of my favorite episodes. Although some people
                criticized the story for being too preachy and politicized, when
                it was wrapped up by Sisko, Bashir, and Dax restoring the
                timeline, I considered it a very memorable and compelling story.
                World War III, which begins in 2026, is mentioned in multiple
                series as a disastrous event for humanity, and although I'm not
                aware of this being shown on screen, this story does fill in
                some of the prelude up to the war. Have any readers seen this
                two-part episode? If so, what are your thoughts on this story
                and the themes it examines?

                    >, Disney has asked a Florida court to dismiss the wrongful
                    death lawsuit filed by Jeffrey Piccolo, husband of Kanokporn
                    Tangsuan, a doctor at NYU Langone in New York City, who
                    passed away after eating a meal at Raglan Road Irish Pub in
                    Disney Springs in October 2023.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tangsuan had a severe dairy and nut allergy and informed the
                    waitstaff at the restaurant of her dietary needs, and was
                    "unequivocally assured" they could be accommodated. She
                    ordered and ate the "Sure I'm Frittered" vegetarian broccoli
                    and corn fritters, the "Scallop Forest" sea scallops
                    appetizer, the "This Shepherd Went Vegan" entree, and a side
                    of onion rings.

                    [...] In the latest update for the Disney Springs wrongful
                    death lawsuit, Disney cited legal language within the terms
                    and conditions for Disney+, which "requires users to
                    arbitrate all disputes with the company." Disney claims
                    Piccolo reportedly agreed to this in 2019 when signing up
                    for a one-month free trial of the streaming service on his
                    PlayStation console.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the May 31 motion filed to move the wrongful death
                    lawsuit to arbitration, Disney attorneys said that the
                    Disney+ subscriber agreement states that any dispute, except
                    for small claims, "must be resolved by individual binding
                    arbitration." Disney says that similar language was agreed
                    to by Piccolo when he used the My Disney Experience app to
                    purchase tickets to visit EPCOT at Walt Disney World in
                    September 2023. Tangsuan died before she and Piccolo could
                    use the tickets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Attorneys for Piccolo called Disney's latest motion
                    "preposterous," and that it's "'absurd' to believe that the
                    153 million subscribers to the popular streaming service
                    have waived all claims against the company and its
                    affiliates because of language 'buried' within the terms and
                    conditions," according to Newsday.

                    It was only in February when Cisco laid off 4,000 people, or
                    5% of its workforce, as it struggled with a challenging
                    economy and weak demand.

                    possibly alongside its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.
                    The publication writes that the number of people being let
                    go is likely to match or be higher than the 4,000 employees
                    laid off in February. The company had nearly 85,000 workers
                    at the end of fiscal 2023; this count does not include the
                    effects of the previous round of layoffs.

                    of cybersecurity specialist Splunk in March, a purchase that
                    Cisco hopes will reduce its reliance on one-time equipment
                    sales by boosting its subscription offerings.

                    As with so many recent layoffs in the tech world, AI has
                    once again played a part in people losing their jobs. Cisco
                    launched a $1 billion fund to make investments in AI
                    startups in June, and it has made 20 AI-focused acquisitions
                    and investments in the last several years. Cost cutting
                    helps offset these big investments, and fears that returns
                    on AI spending won't match the money being poured into the
                    industry isn't helping matters.

                    A recent study has found that 94% of spreadsheets used in
                    business decision-making contain errors, posing serious
                    risks for financial losses and operational mistakes. This
                    finding highlights the need for better quality assurance
                    practices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study, led by Prof. Pak-Lok Poon in collaboration with
                    Central Queensland University, Swinburne University of
                    Technology, City University of Hong Kong, and The Royal
                    Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, shows that most spreadsheets
                    used in important business applications have errors that can
                    affect decision-making processes. "The high rate of errors
                    in these spreadsheets is concerning," says Prof. Poon.

                  <p>
                    Errors in spreadsheets can lead to poor decisions, resulting
                    in financial losses, pricing mistakes, and operational
                    problems in fields like health care and nuclear operations.
                    "These mistakes can cause major issues in various sectors,"

                    The Sun is going through an intense time right now. Our host
                    star is experiencing increased activity, with a series of
                    solar eruptions aimed towards Earth that resulted in a rare

                    geomagnetic storm triggered bright, colorful auroras last
                    night in different parts of the world, with a chance for

                    least five CMEs that erupted from the Sun since last week in
                    anticipation that some may be headed towards Earth. “Some
                    seem to have missed Earth, some clipped Earth, and then
                    eventually one of those we were anticipating was much more
                    of a good punch,” Shawn Dahl, service coordinator for the

                    of sunspots since 2002. CMEs typically erupt from regions on
                    the Sun with increased amounts of magnetic flux associated
                    with sunspots, and so far the Sun has sprouted 299 sunspots

                    increased activity all of this year, all of next year, and
                    even in 2026 where we’ll continue to have higher chances
                    this type of activity to continue to happen from time to

                    In San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood, neighbors
                    say repeated honking from Waymo driverless cars is
                    disturbing their sleep.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Multiple residents in high-rise buildings off of 2nd Street
                    near Harrison Street told NBC Bay Area News they have been
                    hearing Waymo vehicles honking in a nearby parking lot for
                    the past several weeks. They said that the lot began to be
                    occupied by Waymo vehicles just a few weeks ago. The Waymos
                    appear to go to the lot to rest in between rides.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Christopher Cherry who lives in the building next door said
                    he was "really excited" to have Waymo in the neighborhood,
                    thinking it would bring more security and quiet to the area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We started out with a couple of honks here and there, and
                    then as more and more cars started to arrive, the situation
                    got worse, " Cherry said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cherry said the honking happens daily at different levels,
                    with the most intense honking occurring at around 4:00 a.m.
                    and at evening rush hour times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Videos from residents of these incidents show Waymo
                    cars filing into the parking lot, and then attempting to
                    back into spots, which appears to trigger honking from the
                    other Waymo cars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Neighbors note, there is no one in the cars that they
                    can flag down and ask to stop the honking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I think the most frustrating thing about this is that there
                    is just nobody to talk to, and even at the corporate level,
                    I am finding it difficult, not impossible," White said.

                    The CrowdStrike outage was a massive global event, which has
                    now been recognised with a massive Pwnie Award trophy. The
                    two-tiered trophy awarded to CrowdStrike dwarfed the smaller
                    pony-shaped ones for other categories, as befitting the
                    eclipsing size of its blunder.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Definitely not the award to be proud of receiving,"
                    <a href="https://x.com/singe/status/1822324795645575263"
                      >Sentonas said in his acceptance speech</a
                    >, taking the stage to laughter and applause. "I think the
                    team was surprised when I said straight away that I'd be
                    coming to get it. We got this horribly wrong, we've said
                    that a number of different times. It's super important to
                    own it when you do things well, it's super important to own
                    it when you do things horribly wrong, which we did in this
                    case."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Accepting the large golden trophy, Sentonas stated that he
                    intended to display it at CrowdStrike's headquarters in
                    Austin, Texas. His hope is that it will serve as a reminder
                    to CrowdStrike's staff to prevent such mistakes from
                    happening in the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The reason why I wanted the trophy is I'm heading back to
                    headquarters," Sentosas continued. "I'm gonna take the
                    trophy with me, it's gonna sit pride of place, because I
                    want every CrowdStriker who comes to work to see it. Because
                    our goal is to protect people, and we got this wrong, and I
                    want to make sure that everybody understands these things
                    can't happen, and that's what this community's about. So
                    from that perspective I will say thank you."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sentonas' in-person acceptance of CrowdStrike's Pwnie Award
                    was widely well-received, with social media users praising
                    him for accepting accountability with humility, class, and
                    good humour.

                    Though CrowdStrike's Most Epic Fail trophy was only awarded
                    this weekend, its win had already been announced alongside

                    in late July. This was within mere days of the

                    that took down numerous companies and services worldwide. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a post to X at the time, the Pwnie Awards stated that it
                    was granting the early award due to
                    <a
                      href="https://x.com/PwnieAwards/status/1816163091316629819"
                      >"extenuating circumstances."</a
                    >
                    Said circumstance was likely the fact that CrowdStrike's
                    fail was so epic that no one was likely to match it unless
                    they deliberately tried. Even then, it would still be a
                    difficult task.

                  <p>
                    While all other categories at the 2024 Pwnie Awards had
                    three finalists, CrowdStrike had no competition for the Epic
                    Fail Award. Instead,

                    submitted to the US District Court for the Southern District

                    tried to sell this huge collection of personal data on the
                    dark web to the tune of $3.5 million. It's worth noting that
                    due to the sheer number of people affected, this data likely
                    comes from both the U.S. and other countries around the
                    world.

                    Here's everything we know so far about this massive data

                    your personal information was exposed online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So how does a firm like National Public Data obtain the
                    personal data of almost 3 billion people? The answer is
                    through scraping which is a technique used by companies to
                    collect data from web sites and other sources online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What makes the way National Public Data did this more
                    concerning is that the firm scraped personally identifiable
                    information (<a
                      href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/your-browsers-spell-check-feature-could-be-giving-away-your-passwords"
                      >PII</a
                    >) of billions of people from non-public sources. As a
                    result, many of the people who are now involved in the class
                    action lawsuit did not provide their data to the company
                    willingly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the complaint, one of the plaintiffs who
                    resides in California first found out about the breach
                    because he was using one of the
                    <a

                    >
                    which notified him that his data was exposed and leaked on
                    the dark web.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As part of the class action lawsuit, this plaintiff is
                    asking the court to have National Public Data securely
                    dispose of all the personal information it acquired through
                    scraping. However, he also wants the firm to compensate him
                    and the other victims financially while implementing
                    stricter security measures going forward.

                    With full names, addresses and Social Security Numbers in
                    hand, there's a lot that hackers can do with this
                    information, especially when it was made available for sale
                    on the dark web.

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    [...]     Mr. Oliva tells us that, between enshittified
                    software and free software, the choice is not hard. It’s the
                    very article’s title, and it alone should scandalize anyone
                    with minimal knowledge in the matter between its implicit
                    lack of touch with objective reality and its close distance
                    with hypocrisy, all that in a very light tone that even had
                    the intention of being somehow funny. And this discourse
                    wasn’t even in a divulgation context, with an auditorium
                    strange to free software: it was for LibrePlanet, where most
                    people use free software and knows its history and details.
                    Considering that Mr. Oliva is a public and important figure
                    inside the community, a referent, and also considering that
                    I can very rarely participate in this kind of community
                    events -because I have very little free time-, I immediately
                    asked myself: is this the kind of stuff the community is
                    talking about? Are this the discursive lines our references
                    tell us to follow?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        No, Mr. Oliva, I’m afraid you’re deeply mistaken:
                    <em>choosing free software is hard</em>. VERY hard.
                    <i>TOO</i> hard, I dare say. And I have my serious
                    suspicions that our leaders/references and the course of our
                    communities has a lot to do with that. But let’s take a look
                    at this argument by contrasting my context with your
                    article.
                  </p>
                  <p>The tip of the iceberg</p>
                  <p>
                        Mr. Oliva tells us about different types of software
                    enshittification in different contexts, both historical and
                    operational. Stuff we all know and hate like forced updates,
                    software stores, remote policying, inability to go back to
                    previous versions, and so on and so on. Please go read the
                    full article, as in this regards is actually fruitful if you
                    don’t know what we’re talking about here. I believe all of
                    Mr. Oliva’s remarks are true: enshittification is a real
                    phenomenon, he’s not the first one to mention it (as he
                    adequately clarifies), and it’s an actual and important
                    issue that we all need to pay attention to. That’s all fine,
                    and the problem with his article of course is not there. The
                    problem is how he talks about it, specially to force his
                    interpretations as if it where some kind of “common sense”.
                    So it’s important to take a look at his arguments.

                Rights which we had in the analog world are getting increasingly
                difficult to carry over into the digital realm. Whether we can
                or not will depend on software and the protocols and file
                formats the software rely upon.

                    As soon as this week, NASA officials will make perhaps the
                    agency's most consequential safety decision in human
                    spaceflight in 21 years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are nearly
                    10 weeks into a test flight that was originally set to last
                    a little more than one week. The two retired US Navy test
                    pilots were the first people to fly into orbit on Boeing's
                    Starliner spacecraft when it launched on June 5. Now, NASA
                    officials aren't sure Starliner is safe enough to bring the
                    astronauts home.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Three of the managers at the center of the pending decision,
                    Ken Bowersox and Steve Stich from NASA and Boeing's LeRoy
                    Cain, either had key roles in the ill-fated final flight of
                    Space Shuttle <em>Columbia </em>in 2003 or felt the
                    consequences of the accident.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At that time, officials misjudged the risk. Seven astronauts
                    died, and the Space Shuttle <em>Columbia</em> was destroyed
                    as it reentered the atmosphere over Texas. Bowersox, Stich,
                    and Cain weren't the people making the call on the health of
                    <em>Columbia</em>'s heat shield in 2003, but they had
                    front-row seats to the consequences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bowersox was an astronaut on the International Space Station
                    when NASA lost <em>Columbia</em>. He and his crewmates were
                    waiting to hitch a ride home on the next Space Shuttle
                    mission, which was delayed two-and-a-half years in the wake
                    of the <em>Columbia </em>accident. Instead, Bowersox's crew
                    came back to Earth later that year on a Russian Soyuz
                    capsule. After retiring from the astronaut corps, Bowersox
                    worked at SpaceX and is now the head of NASA's spaceflight
                    operations directorate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Stich and Cain were NASA flight directors in 2003, and they
                    remain well-respected in human spaceflight circles. Stich is
                    now the manager of NASA's commercial crew program, and Cain
                    is now a Boeing employee and chair of the company's
                    Starliner mission director. For the ongoing Starliner
                    mission, Bowersox, Stich, and Cain are in the
                    decision-making chain.

                    All three joined NASA in the late 1980s, soon after the
                    <em>Challenger </em>accident. They have seen NASA attempt to
                    reshape its safety culture after both of NASA's fatal Space
                    Shuttle tragedies. After <em>Challenger, </em>NASA's
                    astronaut office had a more central role in safety
                    decisions, and the agency made efforts to listen to dissent
                    from engineers. Still, human flaws are inescapable, and
                    NASA's culture was unable to alleviate them during
                    <em>Columbia</em>'s last flight in 2003.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "I have wondered if some in management roles today
                    that were here when we lost <em>Challenger</em> and
                    <em>Columbia </em>remember that in both of those tragedies,
                    there were those that were not comfortable proceeding," Milt
                    Heflin, a retired NASA flight director who spent 47 years at
                    the agency, wrote in an email to Ars. "Today, those memories
                    are still around."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I suspect Stich and Cain are paying attention to the right
                    stuff," Heflin wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The question facing NASA's leadership today? Should the two
                    astronauts return to Earth from the International Space
                    Station in Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, with its history
                    of thruster failures and helium leaks, or should they come
                    home on a SpaceX Dragon capsule?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under normal conditions, the first option is the choice
                    everyone at NASA would like to make. It would be least
                    disruptive to operations at the space station and would
                    potentially maintain a clearer future for Boeing's Starliner
                    program, which NASA would like to become operational for
                    regular crew rotation flights to the station.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But some people at NASA

                      href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/nasa-official-acknowledges-internal-disagreement-on-safety-of-starliner-return/"
                      >aren't convinced this is the right call</a
                    >. Engineers still don't fully understand why five of the
                    Starliner spacecraft's thrusters overheated and lost power
                    as the capsule approached the space station for docking in
                    June. Four of these five control jets are now back in action
                    with near-normal performance, but managers would like to be
                    sure the same thrusters—and maybe more—won't fail again as
                    Starliner departs the station and heads for reentry.

                    underpinning the clinical development of MDMA—aka ecstasy—as
                    a psychedelic treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.
                    The move came just a day after news broke that the Food and

                    The lawsuits also argue that RealPage pressures landlords to
                    comply with its pricing suggestions—something that would
                    make no sense if the company were merely being paid to offer

                    with ProPublica, Jeffrey Roper, who helped develop one of
                    RealPage's main software tools, acknowledged that one of the
                    greatest threats to a landlord's profits is when nearby
                    properties set prices too low. "If you have idiots
                    undervaluing, it costs the whole system," he said. RealPage
                    thus makes it hard for customers to override its
                    recommendations, according to the lawsuits, allegedly even
                    requiring a written justification and explicit approval from
                    RealPage staff. Former employees have said that failure to
                    comply with the company's recommendations could result in
                    clients being kicked off the service. "This, to me, is the
                    biggest giveaway," Lee Hepner, an antitrust lawyer at the
                    American Economic Liberties Project, an anti-monopoly
                    organization, told me. "Enforced compliance is the hallmark
                    feature of any cartel."

                  <p>
                    [...] The challenge is this: Under existing antitrust law,
                    showing that companies A and B used algorithm C to raise
                    prices isn't enough; you need to show that there was some
                    kind of agreement between companies A and B, and you need to
                    allege some specific factual basis that the agreement
                    existed <i>before</i> you can formally request evidence of
                    it. This dynamic can place plaintiffs in a catch-22:
                    Plausibly alleging the existence of a price-fixing agreement
                    is hard to do without access to evidence like private
                    emails, internal documents, or the algorithm itself. But
                    they typically can't uncover those kinds of materials until
                    they are given the legal power to request evidence in
                    discovery. "It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round
                    hole," Richard Powers, a former deputy assistant attorney
                    general in the DOJ antitrust division, told me. "It makes
                    the job really hard."

                    have outlined ways in which algorithms could fix prices that
                    would be even more difficult to prevent or
                    prosecute—including situations in which an algorithm learns
                    to fix prices withouts its creators or users intending it
                    to. Something similar could occur even if companies used
                    <i>different</i> third-party algorithms to set prices. They
                    point to
                    <a
                      href="https://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/clark_acex_jan_2021.pdf"
                      >a recent study</a
                    >
                    of German gas stations, which found that when one major
                    player adopted a pricing algorithm, its margins didn't
                    budge, but when two major players adopted different pricing
                    algorithms, the margins for both increased by 38 percent.
                    "In situations like these, the algorithms themselves
                    actually learn to collude with each other," Stucke told me.
                    "That could make it possible to fix prices at a scale that
                    we've never seen."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    None of the situations Stucke and Ezrachi describe involve
                    an explicit agreement, making them almost impossible to
                    prosecute under existing antitrust laws. Price-fixing, in
                    other words, has entered the algorithmic age, but the laws
                    designed to prevent it have not kept up. Powers said he
                    believes existing antitrust laws cover algorithmic
                    collusion—but he worried that he might be wrong. "That's the
                    thing that kept me up at night," he said about his tenure at
                    the Department of Justice. "The worry that all 100-plus
                    years of case law on price-fixing could be circumvented by
                    technology."

                    seen. In the meantime, more and more companies are figuring
                    out ways to use algorithms to set prices. If these really do
                    enable de facto price-fixing, and manage to escape legal
                    scrutiny, the result could be a kind of pricing dystopia in
                    which competition to create better products and lower prices
                    would be replaced by coordination to keep prices high and
                    profits flowing. That would mean permanently higher costs
                    for consumers—like an inflation nightmare that never ends.
                    More profound, it would undermine the incentives that keep
                    economies growing and living standards rising. The basic
                    premise of free-market capitalism is that prices are set
                    through open competition, not by a central planner. That
                    goes for algorithmic central planners too.

                    The main challenge was that according to conventional
                    understanding, when two white dwarfs collide like this, they
                    should explode and disappear. However, this merger left
                    behind a white dwarf. The spinning white dwarf was expected
                    to create a stellar wind (a fast-flowing stream of
                    particles) immediately after its formation. However, what
                    the researchers found was something else.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If the wind had started blowing immediately after SNR
                    1181's formation, we couldn't reproduce the observed size of
                    the inner shock region," said Ko. "However, by treating the
                    wind's onset time as variable, we succeeded in explaining
                    all of the observed features of SNR 1181 accurately and
                    unraveling the mysterious properties of this high-speed
                    wind. We were also able to simultaneously track the time
                    evolution of each shock region, using numerical
                    calculations."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team was very surprised to find that according to their
                    calculations, the wind may have started blowing only very
                    recently, within the past 20-30 years. They suggest this may
                    indicate that the white dwarf has started to burn again,
                    possibly due to some of the matter thrown out by the
                    explosion witnessed in 1181 falling back to its surface,
                    increasing its density and temperature over a threshold to
                    restart burning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To validate their computer model, the team is now preparing
                    to further observe SNR 1181 using the Very Large Array (VLA)
                    radio telescope based in central New Mexico and the
                    8.2-meter-class Subaru Telescope in Hawaii.

                    "The ability to determine the age of supernova remnants or
                    the brightness at the time of their explosion through
                    archaeological perspectives is a rare and invaluable asset
                    to modern astronomy," said Ko. "Such interdisciplinary
                    research is both exciting and highlights the immense
                    potential for combining diverse fields to uncover new
                    dimensions of astronomical phenomena."

                    positive impacts," said co-author, Dr. Mengyu Li, a Horizon
                    Fellow also at the Center for Integrated Analysis in the
                    Faculty of Science. "While trade can promote economic growth

                    The research, which spans three decades from 1990 to 2018,
                    employs a systematic quantitative assessment of 12 selected
                    Sustainable Development Goals. The authors say that the lack
                    of defined consumption-based indicators aligned with the SDG
                    framework has hindered a comprehensive understanding of
                    these trends.

                  <p>
                    As an alternative, the authors propose the use of
                    consumption-based proxies to analyze global supply chain
                    dynamics, trends and their implications for progress towards
                    the UN SDGs.

                    The study identified the biggest polarizing effects in SDG13
                    (Climate Action), SDG11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)
                    and SDG2 (Zero Hunger). The biggest equalizing effects were
                    identified for SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and

                    In the name of consumer protection, a slew of U.S. federal
                    agencies are working to make it easier for Americans to

                    A broad new government initiative, dubbed "Time Is Money,"
                    includes a rollout of new regulations and the promise of
                    more for industries spanning from healthcare and fitness
                    memberships to media subscriptions.

                    "The administration is cracking down on all the ways that
                    companies, through paperwork, hold times and general
                    aggravation waste people's money and waste people's time and
                    really hold onto their money," Neera Tanden, White House
                    domestic policy adviser, told reporters Friday in advance of
                    the announcement.

                    "Essentially in all of these practices, companies are
                    delaying services to you or really trying to make it so
                    difficult for you to cancel the service that they get to
                    hold onto your money for longer and longer," Tanden said.
                    "These seemingly small inconveniences don't happen by
                    accident — they have huge financial consequences."

                    the course of August.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The updated CPU microcode, which should be finalized in the
                    coming days, is supposed to stop Intel's wobbly desktop
                    microprocessors from crashing at normal clock speeds (an
                    "instability" as the x86 giant puts it) to frying themselves
                    and causing permanent damage if not complete failure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Apparently, the original microcode for Raptor Lake
                    processors applied too much voltage to chips. While
                    increasing voltage can make it possible to hit higher clock
                    speeds with ironclad stability, too much voltage can be
                    dangerous and degrade the silicon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although microcode updates are developed by Intel, they have
                    to be distributed via motherboard BIOSes developed by
                    individual motherboard vendors, including DIY brands like
                    ASUS and MSI, and also OEMs. When it comes to microcode
                    patches, Intel (and its rival AMD) can't guarantee when
                    users will receive it or if all users will even get it at
                    all, since it is up to individual motherboard makers to
                    issue new BIOS versions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's not ideal for both Chipzilla and owners of Raptor
                    Lake CPUs, as the longer it takes for the microcode to
                    disseminate, the more opportunities there are for more chips
                    to fail, providing more fuel for

                  <p>
                    However, at least ASUS and MSI seem to be working fast on
                    updating their motherboards, with both saying that they'll
                    start distributing BIOSes with the new microcode next week.
                    Intel said the microcode itself wouldn't be done until the
                    middle of the month.

                    Engineers on NASA's NEOWISE (Near-Earth Object Wide-field
                    Infrared Survey Explorer) mission commanded the spacecraft
                    to turn its transmitter off for the last time Thursday. This
                    concludes more than 10 years of its planetary defense
                    mission to search for asteroids and comets, including those
                    that could pose a threat to Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] NASA ended the mission because NEOWISE will soon drop
                    too low in its orbit around Earth to provide usable science
                    data. An uptick in solar activity is heating the upper
                    atmosphere, causing it to expand and create drag on the
                    spacecraft, which does not have a propulsion system to keep
                    it in orbit. Now decommissioned, NEOWISE is expected to
                    safely burn up in our planet's atmosphere in late 2024.

                    During its operational lifetime, the infrared survey
                    telescope exceeded scientific objectives for not one but two
                    missions, starting with the WISE (Wide-field Infrared Survey
                    Explorer) mission. Managed by JPL, WISE launched in December
                    2009 with a seven-month mission to scan the entire infrared
                    sky.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By July 2010, WISE had accomplished this with far greater
                    sensitivity than previous surveys. A few months later, the
                    telescope ran out of the coolant that kept heat produced by
                    the spacecraft from interfering with its infrared
                    observations. (Invisible to the human eye, infrared
                    wavelengths are associated with heat.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA extended the mission under the name NEOWISE until
                    February 2011 to complete a survey of the main belt
                    asteroids, at which point the spacecraft was put into
                    hibernation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Analysis of this data showed that although the lack of
                    coolant meant the space telescope could no longer observe
                    the faintest infrared objects in the universe, it could
                    still make precise observations of asteroids and comets that
                    generate a strong infrared signal from being heated by the
                    sun as they travel past our planet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA brought the telescope out of hibernation in 2013 under
                    the Near-Earth Object Observations Program, a precursor for
                    the agency's Planetary Defense Coordination Office, to
                    continue the NEOWISE survey of asteroids and comets in the
                    pursuit of planetary defense.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The NEOWISE mission has provided a unique,
                    long-duration data set of the infrared sky that will be used
                    by scientists for decades to come," said Amy Mainzer,
                    principal investigator for both NEOWISE and NEO Surveyor at
                    the University of California, Los Angeles. "But its
                    additional legacy is that it has helped lay the groundwork
                    for NASA's next planetary defense infrared space telescope."
