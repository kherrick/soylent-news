                    Federal prosecutors indicted a Nebraska man on charges he
                    perpetrated a cryptojacking scheme that defrauded two cloud
                    providers—one based in Seattle and the other in Redmond,

                    III—45 of Omaha, Nebraska—with wire fraud, money laundering,
                    and engaging in unlawful monetary transactions in connection
                    with the scheme. Parks has yet to enter a plea and is
                    scheduled to make an initial appearance in federal court in
                    Omaha on Tuesday. Parks was arrested last Friday.

                    that Parks defrauded "two well-known providers of cloud

                    resources to mine cryptocurrency.<br />[...]<br />Prosecutors
                    didn't say precisely how Parks was able to trick the
                    providers into giving him elevated services, deferring
                    unpaid payments, or failing to discover the allegedly
                    fraudulent behavior. They also didn't identify either of the
                    cloud providers by name. Based on the details, however, they
                    are almost certainly Amazon Web Services and Microsoft

                    The specific performance characteristics required in battery
                    digital product passports are detailed in Chapter IX of the
                    Battery Regulation Amendment. Technical documentation on the
                    electrochemical performance and durability of the battery
                    must be provided, including details on how this data was
                    obtained. This is to ensure the batteries meet the minimum
                    requirements for battery performance and capacity in order
                    to guarantee batteries on the market are operational and

                    public, regulatory bodies, and battery service and
                    end-of-life processors. Each group of users will need to
                    have different read and write permissions for the data in
                    each battery passport, so that everyone has the information
                    they need while data privacy is maintained. The precise data
                    points each group of users requires access to are detailed
                    in Annex XIII. [...]

                    from President Biden, the preliminary agreement between
                    Samsung and the Department of Commerce will bring the Korean
                    firm's advanced semiconductor manufacturing and research and
                    development to Texas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The deal will result in over $40 billion in investment from
                    Samsung, cementing Texas' role in the advanced semiconductor
                    industry and creating at least 21,500 jobs. There will also
                    be up to $40 million in CHIPS funding used to train and
                    develop the local workforce.

                    "The return of leading-edge chip manufacturing to America is
                    a major new chapter in our semiconductor industry," said
                    White House National Economic Adviser Lael Brainard.

                    Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Samsung's CHIPS money
                    will help support two new chip production facilities, a
                    research center and a packaging facility for 2.5D packaging
                    at its new site in Taylor, Texas. The first of the new fabs
                    will start making 2nm chips in 2026, according to a senior
                    US official. The second fab will also make chips based on
                    2nm and 4nm process nodes
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The money will also allow Samsung to expand its
                    semiconductor facility in Austin, Texas, about 20 miles from
                    the Taylor site.

                    in grants and $5 billion in loans, money that will be used
                    by the company to build a third manufacturing plant in
                    Arizona. TSMC is also making 2nm chips, at its Arizona
                    factory, but they're not set to go into production until
                    2028. Unlike Samsung, the Taiwanese company has no plans to
                    bring advanced packaging facilities to the US.

                    to the software following a cockpit test in which the team
                    found "discrepancies that we wanted to get fixed," changes
                    that made it easier the second time they attempted the test.

                    buttons and manual controllers in the spacecraft because
                    touchscreens are usually not "hardened" or protected against
                    radiation. The company also preferred the old-school style
                    to make it harder to accidentally trigger the wrong setting
                    if an astronaut brushed against the controls.

                    displays, if not the sensations. We heard the United Launch
                    Alliance Atlas V rocket — Starliner's ride off Earth —
                    ignite, along with the firing up of the solid rocket
                    boosters. The "eight ball" indicating forces of gravity upon
                    us began rocking, and various displays showed us the time
                    remaining until main engine cutoff, notional velocity and
                    other critical numbers to tell us if things were going well
                    (or not).

                    Given the astronauts and teams are used to nominal and

                    refinement is now about communication. [.... rest omitted

                    Researchers still disagree on what causes rare and large
                    "rogue waves," which can damage ships, lighthouses, and
                    other structures. Now, using combined measurements of wave
                    heights and wind speed in an oceanic region known for its
                    rough seas, a research team has demonstrated that wind can
                    produce the wave conditions expected to lead to rogue waves
                    [1]. Previously, this idea was demonstrated only in
                    laboratory experiments. The researchers hope this new
                    understanding will contribute to the development of methods
                    for predicting this dangerous phenomenon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is no consensus on what causes rogue waves in the
                    ocean, says Alessandro Toffoli, an expert in infrastructure
                    engineering at the University of Melbourne, Australia. One
                    prominent view is that oceanic rogue waves occur purely
                    through a statistical effect: although waves typically
                    follow a "normal," or Gaussian, distribution, with heights
                    strongly clustering around an average, a fortuitous
                    convergence of many such waves can occasionally produce a
                    very large wave.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In contrast, laboratory experiments and theoretical models
                    suggest that, under the right conditions, nonlinear ocean
                    dynamics can amplify waves, making the distribution of wave
                    heights depart from a Gaussian. The distribution can spread
                    out, giving large waves higher probabilities than in a
                    Gaussian distribution. Unfortunately, says Toffoli, no study
                    has yet observed such increased numbers of larger waves in
                    the ocean. "So this idea has mostly been dismissed as
                    unrealistic," he says. "Are there rogue sea states where
                    rogue waves thrive? The answer to this remains elusive."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To look for such states, Toffoli and colleagues undertook an
                    expedition in the Southern Ocean, a region around Antarctica
                    known for strong winds and large waves. The team made
                    measurements from a South African icebreaker in the austral
                    winter, in June and July 2017. During the voyage, the
                    researchers used a stereo pair of cameras to map the water
                    surface height and measure the statistical characteristics
                    of the waves viewed off one side of the ship. Alongside
                    these measurements, they collected data on local atmospheric
                    conditions, including wind speed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team estimated the kurtosis, a statistical measure
                    of the wave size distribution's departure from a Gaussian.
                    The higher the kurtosis, the more likely are extra-large
                    waves, including rogue waves. In the wind-driven young seas,
                    with slow, strongly driven waves, the researchers found a
                    kurtosis of 3.4, well above the 3.0 value characteristic of
                    seas with a Gaussian distribution of waves. In older seas,
                    the distribution returned to a Gaussian. This observation
                    suggests that the action of strong winds during early stages
                    of wave growth can stir nonlinear ocean dynamics, leading to
                    a strongly non-Gaussian distribution of waves and more
                    frequent rogue waves.

                    I decided to try my hand at decoding these GPS signals,
                    guided by the vague end-goal of plucking out my position
                    from peanuts. I learned that the GPS signals that facilitate
                    our mapping apps are ever-present, around us at any
                    altitude, in any weather conditions, at all times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This sounds cool in the abstract, but the tangible reality
                    is staggering. These signals are all around me as I write
                    this. They're all around you as you read it. The world is
                    soaked in these whispers, repeating themselves endlessly for
                    anyone willing to listen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can find out exactly where you are, from thin air,
                    anywhere at any time, by learning to speak the language of
                    the electromagnetic waves flowing over your skin. These
                    waves have been a constant and quiet companion for most
                    people's entire lives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] All that said, it's not as though there's a cacophony
                    of navigation data swarming around you, deafening if you
                    could just hear it. In reality, the GPS signals surrounding
                    you are astoundingly weak. To take an analogy: imagine a
                    normal light bulb, like the one that might be above you now.
                    Pull it twenty thousand kilometers away from the room you're
                    in, and have it flash, on, off, on, off, a million times a
                    second. Imagine straining your eye to watch the shimmer of
                    the bulb, two Earths away, and listen to what it's telling
                    you.

                    However, Senator Brown notes in his letter that BYD already
                    sells an electric hatchback named the "Seagull" for the
                    equivalent of less than $10,000. This compares with the

                    There is also a national security twist as Senator Brown
                    claims that data collected by the sensors and cameras in
                    Chinese EVs could pose a threat. "China does not allow
                    American-made electric vehicles near their official
                    buildings. To allow their vehicles freedom to travel
                    throughout the United States would be foolish and highly
                    dangerous," he stated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Senator Brown also claims in his letter that nearly 20
                    percent of all electric vehicles sold in Europe during 2023
                    were made in China, citing this as a cautionary example.

                    After just 10 years in use, a Norwegian bridge collapsed
                    into a river and left two drivers in need of rescue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Tretten Bridge in the Øyer area of southern Norway
                    collapsed in 2022 after a heavy goods vehicle attempted to
                    cross it. Now, an inquiry into the collapse of the bridge
                    over the Gudbrandsdalslågen river has found that it failed
                    because its designers spent too long making sure it looked
                    nice and not enough time ensuring it worked as a bridge,
                    reports Dezeen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Designers of the bridge, which was opened in 2012, were
                    accused of "inadequate caution" in the development of the
                    span. As Dezeen explains:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        "The investigation has shown that inadequate caution was
                        exercised in the planning, design, inspection and
                        approval of Tretten Bridge, with respect to the risk
                        factors linked to its unconventional design," the report
                        said.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        "A short construction period, span lengths and reuse of
                        existing foundation were framework conditions for the
                        planning of the bridge," it continued.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        "These framework conditions, combined with the choice of
                        material and a strong focus on aesthetics, contributed
                        to the structure not being robust."
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    [...] During the bridge's design and build process, Norway
                    was transitioning from its own, older building regulations
                    to new European rules governing bridge design.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At this time, projects in progress were permitted to work to
                    the older regulations, and that's exactly what the team
                    behind the Tretten Bridge followed. The investigation
                    touched on this as well, stating that "all the involved
                    parties can be criticized" for their decision to work within
                    outdated frameworks.

                    Every version of the PuTTY tools from 0.68 to 0.80 inclusive
                    has a critical vulnerability in the code that generates
                    signatures from ECDSA private keys which use the NIST P521
                    curve. (PuTTY, or Pageant, generates a signature from a key
                    when using it to authenticate you to an SSH server.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This vulnerability has been assigned
                    <a
                      href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31497"
                      >CVE-2024-31497</a
                    >. It was discovered by Fabian Bäumer and Marcus Brinkmann
                    of the Ruhr University Bochum; see their write-up
                    <a
                      href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/15/6"

                  <p>
                    The bad news: the effect of the vulnerability is to
                    <strong>compromise the private key</strong>. An attacker in
                    possession of a few dozen signed messages and the public key
                    has enough information to recover the private key, and then
                    forge signatures as if they were from you, allowing them to
                    (for instance) log in to any servers you use that key for.
                    To obtain these signatures, an attacker need only briefly
                    compromise any server you use the key to authenticate to, or
                    momentarily gain access to a copy of Pageant holding the
                    key. (However, these signatures are not exposed to passive
                    eavesdroppers of SSH connections.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, if you have a key of this type, we recommend you
                    revoke it immediately: remove the old public key from all
                    OpenSSH authorized_keys files, and the equivalent in other
                    SSH servers, so that a signature from the compromised key
                    has no value any more. Then generate a new key pair to
                    replace it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (The problem is not with how the key was originally
                    generated; it doesn't matter whether it came from PuTTYgen
                    or somewhere else. What matters is whether it was ever
                    <em>used</em> with PuTTY or Pageant.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The good news: the <em>only</em> affected key type is
                    521-bit ECDSA. That is, a key that appears in Windows
                    PuTTYgen with ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 at the start of the 'Key
                    fingerprint' box, or is described as 'NIST p521' when loaded
                    into Windows Pageant, or has an id starting
                    ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 in the SSH protocol or the key file.
                    Other sizes of ECDSA, and other key algorithms, are
                    unaffected. In particular, Ed25519 is not affected.

                    In engineering, the buckling of a structure, such as a
                    bridge, often preempts its catastrophic failure. In nature,
                    however, buckling can be a positive feature, providing a
                    structure with new capabilities. For example, the buckling
                    of ridge-like structures on the wings of an ermine moth can
                    generate bursts of ultrasonic clicks that can deter
                    predators. Now scientists from the University of Bristol,
                    UK, have explained how this mechanism works. This finding
                    provides insights for bio-inspired designs of soft robots,
                    acoustics-based monitoring devices for the structural health
                    of buildings, and objects that can morph from one shape into
                    another.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moths have long been known to possess sound-based mechanisms
                    to deter predators that use echolocation to detect prey. For
                    example, a tiger moth can snap sound-producing organs
                    (tymbals) located in its thorax to create ultrasonic clicks
                    that deter bats. Ermine moths, of which there are several
                    hundred species, produce defensive sounds in a different
                    way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The tymbals of an ermine moth are in its wings. These
                    structures produce two bursts of ultrasonic clicks in each
                    wingbeat cycle—one during the upstroke and one during the
                    downstroke. The clicks have the right frequency to confuse
                    the echolocation abilities of a nearby bat, making the bat
                    think the moth is unpalatable. The clicks thus provide an
                    ermine moth with a passive acoustic defense system that
                    becomes active whenever it is in flight. "These insects
                    don't have ears, so they don't know that they're producing
                    this sound," says Marc Holderied, one of the researchers on
                    the study. "Evolution has equipped them with this fantastic
                    tool in their wings that protects them against bats, and
                    they don't even know about it."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The experiments and simulations indicate that
                    curvature changes in the hindwings during the wingbeat cycle
                    caused the tymbals to buckle sequentially. This buckling
                    excites vibrations in a neighboring region of the wing that
                    is free of scales and feathers. This excitation then
                    amplifies the vibrations, which have ultrasonic frequencies,
                    radiating them into the environment. Holderied likens the
                    process to that which occurs during a rim shot—a percussive
                    drumming technique that involves simultaneously hitting the
                    rim and the head of a drum. He says that the sequential
                    clicks are essentially a series of rim shots, which use the
                    drumhead to amplify the sounds of the rim being hit,
                    allowing them to be heard farther away.

                    adjust the appearance as much as the functionality of

                    version has escaped this customization craze. However,

                    simply renaming the .exe to something else is enough to get

                    for some other reason? One thing is certain, however: while
                    Windows 11 is still struggling to establish itself,
                    particularly in the face of Windows 10, this kind of
                    "publicity" is not working in its favor.

                    Apple Inc.'s iPhone shipments slid a worse-than-projected
                    10% in the March quarter, reflecting flagging sales in China
                    despite a broader smartphone industry rebound.

                    The company shipped 50.1 million iPhones in the first three
                    months, according to market tracker IDC, falling shy of the
                    51.7 million average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg.
                    The 9.6% year-on-year drop is the steepest for Apple since
                    Covid lockdowns snarled supply chains in 2022, the
                    researchers said.

                    The Cupertino, California-based iPhone maker has struggled
                    to sustain sales in China since the debut of its latest
                    model in September. The resurgence of rivals from Huawei
                    Technologies Co. to Xiaomi Corp. and a Beijing ban on
                    foreign devices in the workplace have all weighed on sales.
                    The IDC data provides the first snapshot of the global
                    performance of Apple's most important product ahead of
                    earnings on May 2.

                  <p>
                    [...] The drop in iPhone shipments is significant given the
                    overall mobile market registered its best growth in years.

                  <p>
                    [...] Average selling prices for handsets are rising, as
                    consumers increasingly opt for premium models that they
                    intend to hold on to for longer, IDC's researchers found.
                    Apple, which consistently maintains the highest ASP in the
                    industry, has led the way in this, with consumers showing a
                    distinct preference for its higher-tier models. Still, the
                    company has this year resorted to unusual discounts to spur
                    sales, with some retail partners in China taking as much as
                    $180 off the regular price.

                Researchers have tracked muscle contractions in a bird's vocal
                tract, and reconstructed the song it was silently singing in its
                sleep. The resulting audio is a very specific call, allowing the
                team to figure out what the bird's dream was about.

                    When birds sleep, the part of their brains dedicated to
                    daytime singing remains active, showing patterns that
                    resemble those produced while awake. Researchers from the
                    University of Buenos Aires (UBA) previously demonstrated
                    that these brain patterns activate a bird's vocal muscles,
                    enabling them to silently 'replay' a song during sleep.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, until now, it hasn't been possible to map how that
                    nocturnal activity gets processed. In their new study, the
                    UBA researchers turned the vocal muscle movements made
                    during avian dreaming into synthetic songs.

                    "Dreams are one of the most intimate and elusive parts of
                    our existence," said Gabriel Mindlin, a specialist in the
                    physical mechanisms behind birdsong and corresponding author
                    of the study. "Knowing that we share this with such a
                    distant species is very moving. And the possibility of
                    entering the mind of a dreaming bird – listening to how that
                    dream sounds – is a temptation impossible to resist."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A bird's vocal sounds are made by a unique organ only they
                    possess, the syrinx. Located at the base of the windpipe
                    (trachea), passing air causes some or all of the organ's
                    walls to vibrate, while a surrounding air sac acts like a
                    resonating chamber. The pitch of the sound produced depends
                    on the tension surrounding muscles exert on the syrinx and
                    the airways.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Custom-made electromyography (EMG) electrodes were
                    implanted in the birds to measure the muscle response and
                    electrical activity in the obliquus ventralis muscle, the
                    most prominent muscle producing the kiskadee's birdsong. EMG
                    and birdsong audio were recorded simultaneously while the
                    birds were awake and asleep. An existing dynamical systems
                    model of the kiskadee's sound production mechanism was used
                    to translate the information into synthetic songs. In basic
                    terms, a dynamical systems model breaks down what occurs in
                    the syrinx when sound is produced into a series of
                    mathematical equations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Analyzing muscular activity during sleep revealed
                    consistent activity patterns corresponding to the trills
                    produced by kiskadees during daytime territorial fights.
                    Interestingly, the 'dreaming trills' were associated with
                    raised head feathers, the same as during the daytime. The
                    researchers created a synthetic version of one of the trills
                    from the data they'd collected.

                    Highly capable hackers are rooting multiple corporate
                    networks by exploiting a maximum-severity zero-day
                    vulnerability in a firewall product from Palo Alto Networks,
                    researchers said Friday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The vulnerability, which has been under active exploitation
                    for at least two weeks now, allows the hackers with no
                    authentication to execute malicious code with root
                    privileges, the highest possible level of system access,
                    researchers said. The extent of the compromise, along with
                    the ease of exploitation, has earned the CVE-2024-3400
                    vulnerability the maximum severity rating of 10.0. The
                    ongoing attacks are the latest in a rash of attacks aimed at
                    firewalls, VPNs, and file-transfer appliances, which are
                    popular targets because of their wealth of vulnerabilities
                    and direct pipeline into the most sensitive parts of a
                    network.

                    service and ensuring vulnerability protection has been
                    applied to their GlobalProtect interface. When that's not
                    possible, customers should temporarily disable telemetry

                    Volexity, the security firm that discovered the zero-day
                    attacks, said that it's currently unable to tie the
                    attackers to any previously known groups. However, based on
                    the resources required and the organizations targeted, they
                    are "highly capable" and likely backed by a nation-state. So
                    far, only a single threat group—which Volexity tracks as
                    UTA0218—is known to be leveraging the vulnerability in
                    limited attacks. The company warned that as new groups learn
                    of the vulnerability, CVE-2024-3400, is likely to come under
                    mass exploitation, just as recent zero-days affecting

                    [...] The earliest attacks Volexity has seen took place on
                    March 26 in what company researchers suspect was UTA0218
                    testing the vulnerability by placing zero-byte files on
                    firewall devices to validate exploitability. On April 7, the
                    researchers observed the group trying unsuccessfully to
                    install a backdoor on a customer's firewall. Three days
                    later, the group's attacks were successfully deploying
                    malicious payloads. Since then, the threat group has
                    deployed custom, never-before-seen post-exploitation
                    malware. The backdoor, which is written in the Python
                    language, allows the attackers to use specially crafted
                    network requests to execute additional commands on hacked
                    devices.

                    Tesla warns owners that opening their doors or windows while
                    installing a software update could damage the vehicle, so
                    she stayed put
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the Tesla owner's manual, "Vehicle functions,
                    including some safety systems and opening or closing the
                    doors or windows, may be limited or disabled when
                    installation is in progress and you could damage the
                    vehicle." Janel chose to heed Tesla's warning and did not
                    attempt to open her doors or windows during the installation
                    process for fear of damaging her vehicle, but this seems
                    like a very dangerous oversight on Tesla's part that she was
                    able to be stuck inside at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The door mechanisms on the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y are
                    electrically operated, and under normal circumstances are
                    opened from the inside using a simple button to unlatch the
                    door. Should the vehicle have no power, these models do have
                    auxiliary manual cable release levers also found on the door
                    panel, but Tesla warns against using the manual mechanism,
                    citing that it should only be used when the car has no
                    power. Janel said she was aware of this option but didn't
                    want to risk damaging her car, and she felt confident that
                    she could stick out the heat.

                    In contrast to Tesla's potentially dangerous warnings, Lucid
                    Motors requires all occupants to exit the vehicle before the
                    installation process begins, and the Lucid Air owners manual
                    states that owners will not be able to lock or unlock the
                    doors during an update. The Air will start a two-minute
                    countdown when an owner chooses to install an update, giving
                    them enough time to get out prior to the update beginning.

                    The sense of touch has immense importance for many aspects
                    of our life. It is the first of all the senses to develop in
                    newborns and the most direct experience of contact with our
                    physical and social environment. Complementing our own touch
                    experience, we also regularly receive touch from others
                    around us, for example, through consensual hugs, kisses or
                    massages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The recent coronavirus pandemic has raised awareness
                    regarding the need to better understand the effects that
                    touch—and its reduction during social distancing—can have on
                    our mental and physical well-being. The most common touch
                    interventions, for example, massage for adults or kangaroo
                    care for newborns, have been shown to have a wide range of
                    both mental and physical health benefits, from facilitating
                    growth and development to buffering against anxiety and
                    stress, over the lifespan of humans and animals alike. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A critical issue highlighted in the pandemic was the lack of
                    touch due to social restrictions. To accommodate the need
                    for touch in individuals with small social networks (for
                    example, institutionalized or isolated individuals), touch
                    interventions using objects/robots have been explored in the
                    past (for a review, see ref. 11). We show here that touch
                    interactions outside of the human–human domain are
                    beneficial for mental and physical health outcomes. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In conclusion, we show clear evidence that touch
                    interventions are beneficial across a large number of both
                    physical and mental health outcomes, for both healthy and
                    clinical cohorts, and for all ages. These benefits, while
                    influenced in their magnitude by study cohorts and
                    intervention characteristics, were robustly present,
                    promoting the conclusion that touch interventions can be
                    systematically employed across the population to preserve
                    and improve our health.

                    An international team of researchers led by groups from the
                    Max Planck Institute in Marburg and Phillips University in
                    Marburg has now discovered the first regular molecular
                    fractal in nature. They discovered a microbial
                    enzyme—citrate synthase from a cyanobacterium—that
                    spontaneously assembles into a regular fractal pattern known
                    as the Sierpiński triangle. This is an infinitely repeating
                    series of triangles made up of smaller triangles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We stumbled on this structure completely by accident and
                    almost couldn't believe what we saw when we first took
                    images of it using an electron microscope," says first
                    author Franziska Sendker.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The protein makes these beautiful triangles and as the
                    fractal grows, we see these larger and larger triangular
                    voids in the middle of them, which is totally unlike any
                    protein assembly we've ever seen before," she continues.

                    Because of Apple's restrictions, iMessage only works if you
                    have an iPhone in the mix, Migicovsky says, and will not be
                    a focus for Beeper, given the complications it saw with
                    Apple's shutdown of Beeper Mini. However, Beeper is hopeful
                    regulations could change things, pointing to the DoJ lawsuit
                    and

                    [...] The team expects to have feature parity across
                    platforms in a matter of months as they overhaul the iOS and
                    desktop apps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In time, they plan to add other services to Beeper as well,
                    including Google Voice, Snapchat, and Microsoft Teams.
                    Beeper also offers a widget API so developers can build on
                    top of Beeper. Plus, since Matrix is an open standard,
                    developers will be able to build alternative clients for
                    Beeper, as well.

                    The app will generate revenue via a premium subscription,
                    where the final price may be a couple of dollars per month,
                    but pricing decisions haven't yet been fully nailed down.
                    Beeper is currently free to use.

                    [...] Unsurprisingly, Epic's proposed injunction includes an
                    "anti-retaliation" section specifically aimed at protecting
                    Epic from any further retaliation. If Donato accepts the
                    terms, Google would be violating the injunction order if the
                    tech giant fails to prove that it is not "treating Epic
                    differently than other developers" by making it
                    "disproportionately difficult or costly" for Epic to
                    develop, update, and market its apps on Android.

                  <p>
                    That part of the injunction would seem important since, last

                    that an Epic Games Store was "coming to iOS and Android"
                    later this year.

                      >According to Inc</a
                    >, Epic told Game Developers Conference attendees that its
                    app-distribution platform will be the "first ever
                    game-focused, multiplatform store," working across "Android,
                    iOS, PC and macOS."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Under the proposed injunction, Google would be
                    restricted from introducing any unnecessary steps that might
                    keep users from quickly accessing third-party app stores
                    "beyond the steps required to access the Google Play Store
                    when it is preinstalled."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But otherwise, "Google must allow consumers to
                    download apps from wherever they choose without
                    interference, whether it's from the Google Play Store, a
                    third-party app store, another app, or the web," Epic's blog
                    said. "Under Epic's proposed injunction, Google can't use
                    scare screens and dire warnings that deter consumers from
                    downloading apps from the Internet to their phones."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Epic additionally wants Google to be blocked from seeking
                    pretty much any form of exclusivity for the Google Play
                    Store. That partly means Google wouldn't be able to share
                    revenue from the Play Store with distributors to stop
                    competing app stores from being preinstalled or placed on a
                    device's home screen. They also wouldn't be able to pay
                    developers to exclusively launch or distribute apps through
                    Google Play, including restricting any agreements on special
                    pricing in the Google Play Store. Additionally, Google
                    couldn't stop developers from removing apps from Google Play
                    without Google's consent.

                    [...] "Google has a history of malicious compliance and has
                    attempted to circumvent legislation and regulation meant to
                    rein in their anti-competitive control over Android
                    devices," Epic's blog said. "Our proposed injunction seeks
                    to block Google from repeating past bad-faith tactics and
                    open up Android devices to competition and choice for all
                    developers and consumers."

                    experience" by temporarily removing links to California news
                    websites for "a small percentage of users." That means links
                    to California news websites, like SFGATE, may not appear in

                    [...] Wicks' bill is meant to provide a financial lifeline
                    for news outlets that have struggled to compete for ad
                    dollars — a major funding source for them — in the digital

                    The "journalism usage fee" would be determined by an
                    arbitration process, and an eligible outlet would have to
                    spend at least 70% of the new dollars on hiring additional
                    journalists and support staff.

                    also a co-author on the latest paper, models predicted that
                    the dense layer of titanium-rich material beneath the crust
                    first migrated to the near side of the moon, possibly
                    triggered by a giant impact on the far side, and then sunk
                    into the interior in a network of sheetlike slabs, cascading
                    into the lunar interior almost like waterfalls. But when
                    that material sank, it left behind a small remnant in a
                    geometric pattern of intersecting linear bodies of dense
                    titanium-rich material beneath the crust.

                    "When we saw those model predictions, it was like a
                    lightbulb went on," said Andrews-Hanna, "because we see the
                    exact same pattern when we look at subtle variations in the
                    moon's gravity field, revealing a network of dense material
                    lurking below the crust."

                    us what was happening in the moon's interior during this
                    critical stage in its evolution, and that's really
                    exciting," Andrews-Hanna said. "It turns out that the moon's
                    earliest history is written below the surface, and it just
                    took the right combination of models and data to unveil that

                    "The vestiges of early lunar evolution are present below the

                    It might be the end of the road for two of NASA's most
                    iconic telescopes as the space agency looks to reduce the
                    funding for the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-Ray
                    Observatory, much to the dismay of scientists who rely
                    heavily on the cosmic observations of the missions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shortly after the fate of its 2024 budget was sealed, NASA
                    released its budget proposal for 2025, requesting $1.58
                    billion for its astrophysics division. Despite the 3%
                    increase from what the space agency received this year to
                    spend on astrophysics research, it represents a small
                    reduction in the amount spent on Hubble and a major
                    downgrade for Chandra's budget.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The proposed budget for Hubble Space Telescope in 2025 is
                    $88.9 million, a slight decrease from $98.3 million in 2024,
                    while the Chandra X-Ray Observatory would drop from $68.3
                    million in 2023 to $41.1 million in 2025 and a further
                    reduction to $26.6 million the following year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The reduction to Chandra will start orderly mission
                    drawdown to minimal operations," the budget document read.
                    In its budget request, NASA argues that the Chandra
                    spacecraft "has been degrading over its mission lifetime to
                    the extent that several systems require active management to
                    keep temperatures within acceptable ranges for spacecraft
                    operations. This makes scheduling and the post processing of
                    data more complex, increasing mission management costs
                    beyond what NASA can currently afford."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Patrick Slane, director of the Chandra X-ray Center,
                    responded in a statement, arguing that, while temperatures
                    of the spacecraft have been increasing, the team has
                    "developed thermal models and processes to manage this

                    In the statement, Slane also expressed confusion over NASA's
                    claim of increasing costs, recalling that there was only one
                    instance in which the Chandra mission requested two
                    additional people on the flight team, resulting in a 1%
                    increase in cost in 2022.

                    Maine has a long, proud history as a papermaking state and a
                    long, tortured history with the industry's

                    compounds—per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS—began
                    to be used in the papermaking process. The chemicals were
                    miracle workers: A small amount of PFAS could make paper
                    plates and food containers both grease-proof and
                    water-resistant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, in the '80s, the state encouraged spreading sewage
                    sludge on fields as fertilizer, a seemingly smart use of an
                    otherwise cumbersome by-product of living, hard to manage in
                    a landfill. In principle, human manure can sub in for animal
                    manure without much compromise. But in reality, sludge often
                    contains a cocktail of

                    where we grow food. The initial idea is not great," Apul
                    told me. The Saunderses first found out that the
                    sludge-spreading had contaminated their water after the
                    state found high PFAS levels in

                    two miles away. Maine's limit for six kinds of PFAS was 20
                    parts per trillion; state toxicologists found so much in the
                    Saunderses' well water that when Nathan worked out the
                    average of all the tests taken in 2021, it came to 14,800
                    parts per trillion, he told me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nathan used to work as an engineer for Maine's
                    drinking-water-safety program, and he quickly pieced
                    together the story of their street's contamination and just
                    how bad it was. After state researchers tested their blood,
                    Nathan remembers, a doctor told him that his levels of one
                    PFAS were so high, they had hit the maximum the test could
                    reliably report—2,000 micrograms per liter. So far, he's
                    healthy, but he feels like he's living on borrowed time.
                    Diseases related to environmental exposures can take decades
                    to emerge, and although studies show that PFAS may degrade
                    health at a population level, why some individuals fall ill
                    and others don't isn't always clear. Cordelia told me that
                    the neighbor who wouldn't eat the peaches is now on three
                    medications for high cholesterol (which has been linked to
                    PFAS), and that other neighbors have bladder or brain
                    cancer.

                    [...] Several labs across the country are trying to find a
                    way to unmake these chemicals, using foam fractionation,
                    soil washing, mineralization, electron-beam radiation. David
                    Hanigan, an environmental engineer at the University of

                    whether burning PFAS at ultrahigh temperatures can break the
                    carbon-fluorine bond completely. He once thought that PFAS
                    researchers were out of their minds to be testing such
                    wildly expensive solutions, he told me. But he's realized
                    that PFAS are just that tough, and as a scientist, he thinks
                    the original manufacturers of PFAS must have understood
                    that. "It's upsetting from an organic-chemistry standpoint,"
                    he told me. Any chemist would have known that these
                    compounds would persist in the environment, he said. Indeed,

                    Operating systems take pains to randomize and conceal these
                    locations so they can't be used in software exploits. By
                    chaining an exploit for the lighttpd vulnerability with a

                    [...] According to Zuazo, person-specific biometric data
                    such as iris specs are "ultra-sensitive" and could
                    theoretically be employed for nefarious identification

                    The authors examined the idea of aerial biospheres and how
                    the detection of CHNOPS plays into them. They introduced the
                    concept of nutrient availability levels in exoplanet
                    atmospheres. In their framework, the presence of water is
                    required regardless of other nutrient availability. "We
                    considered any atmosphere without water condensates as
                    uninhabitable," they write, a nod to water's primacy. The
                    researchers assigned different levels of habitability based
                    on the presence and amounts of the CHNOPS nutrients.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To explore their framework of nutrient availability, the
                    researchers turned to simulations. The simulated atmospheres
                    held different levels of nutrients, and the researchers
                    applied their concept of nutrient availability. Their
                    results aim to understand not habitability but the chemical
                    potential for habitability. A planet's atmosphere can be
                    altered drastically by life, and this research aims to
                    understand the atmospheric potential for life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our approach does not directly aim for the understanding of
                    biosignatures and atmospheres of planets, which are
                    inhabited, but for the conditions in which pre-biotic
                    chemistry can occur," they write. In their work, the minimum
                    atmospheric concentration for a nutrient to be available is
                    10<sup>9</sup>, or one ppb (part per billion.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We find that for most atmospheres at ( p gas, T gas)
                    points, where liquid water is stable, CNS-bearing molecules
                    are present at concentrations above 10<sup>9</sup>," they
                    write. They also found that carbon is generally present in
                    every simulated atmosphere and that sulfur availability
                    increases with surface temperature. With lower surface
                    temperatures, nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>) is
                    present in increasing amounts. But with higher surface
                    temperatures, nitrogen can become depleted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Phosphorus is a different matter. "The limiting element of
                    the CHNOPS elements is phosphorus, which is mostly bound in
                    the planetary crust," they write. The authors point out
                    that, at past times in Earth's atmosphere, phosphorus
                    scarcity limited the biosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An aerial biosphere is an interesting idea. But it's not the
                    main thrust of scientists' efforts to detect exoplanet
                    atmospheres. Surface life is their holy grail. It should be
                    no surprise that it still comes down to liquid water, all
                    things considered. "Similar to previous work, our models
                    suggest that the limiting factor for habitability at the
                    surface of a planet is the presence of liquid water," the
                    authors write. In their work, when surface water was
                    available, CNS was available in the lower atmosphere near
                    the surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But surface water plays several roles in atmospheric
                    chemistry. It can bond with some nutrients in some
                    circumstances, making them unavailable, and in other
                    circumstances, it can make them available.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If water is available at the surface, the elements not
                    present in the gas phase are stored in the crust
                    condensates," the authors write. Chemical weathering can
                    then make them available as nutrients. "This provides a
                    pathway to overcome the lack of atmospheric phosphorus and
                    metals, which are used in enzymes that drive many biological
                    processes."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This complicates matters on worlds covered by oceans.
                    Pre-biotic molecules might not be available if there's no
                    opportunity for water and rock to interact with the
                    atmosphere. "If indeed it can be shown that life can form in
                    a water ocean without any exposed land, this constraint
                    becomes weaker, and the potential for the surface
                    habitability becomes mainly a question of water stability,"
                    the authors write.

                    Inspired by the footpads of desert-traversing camels,
                    Bridgestone's first-generation lunar rover tire integrated a
                    soft, metal-based felt material into the tread area to
                    enhance traction on the moon's regolith surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Building on this foundation, the second-generation tire
                    introduces a robust skeletal structure, incorporating thin
                    metal spokes and segmented tread design. These advancements,
                    facilitated by structural simulations and digital
                    technologies, are designed for durability and traction in
                    the harsh lunar environment – characterized by rocks, sand,
                    vacuum conditions and temperature fluctuations.

                Airless tires are nothing new, they existed before pneumatic
                tires. Looking at the pics in this short history, it's easy to
                see why they never went into large production -- complex and
                heavy -- but plenty of inventors tried,

                  <p>
                    It's been twelve years since the big SOPA (Stop Online
                    Piracy Act) /PIPA (Protect IP Act) fight. I've been talking
                    with a few folks lately about how it feels like many people
                    have either forgotten that story or weren't paying attention
                    when it happened. Two years ago, we did a 10-year
                    retrospective on the fight, and it feels like some people
                    need a refresher. Most notably, Charles Rivkin, the head of
                    the MPA (formerly the MPAA), certainly appears to need a
                    refresher because he just announced it's time to bring back
                    SOPA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the young ones in the audience, SOPA (and its Senate
                    companion, PIPA) were bills pushed strongly by the film
                    (MPA) and recording (RIAA) industries. They were pushing for
                    "site blocking" for websites that the industries accused of
                    being "dedicated to piracy." The law was a slam dunk. It had
                    a huge number of co-sponsors, and the MPA/RIAA combo had
                    convinced Congress to pass ever more expansive copyright
                    laws basically every two to three years for the past 25
                    years. SOPA was set to become law.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Until it wasn't. Because the public spoke up loudly. I
                    (coincidentally) was at the Capitol on the day of the big
                    Internet Blackout in protest of SOPA/PIPA, and I heard the
                    phones ringing off the hook. I was running up and down the
                    halls of the office buildings, having Reps. tell me how they
                    were removing their names from the co-sponsor list. The
                    public spoke up and it worked.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it's important to remember why it worked: because the
                    law was a horrific attack on free speech and the open web.
                    And for no good reason.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We spent much time explaining why this would be a clear
                    violation of the First Amendment. Under the First Amendment,
                    you cannot shut down an entire publishing house just because
                    it sometimes has published works that contain, say,
                    defamation. You cannot ban access to a photocopying machine
                    because some users use it to infringe. SOPA was basically
                    built-in prior restraint.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can only target the actually violative content and not
                    declare entire sites be blocked. That goes way beyond what
                    the First Amendment allows.

                    [...] To provide directional information from a stationary
                    device without getting too close, researchers use an array
                    of detector grids along with another grid called a mask,
                    which imprints a pattern on the array that differs depending
                    on the direction of the source. An algorithm interprets the
                    different timings and intensities of signals received by
                    each separate detector or pixel. This often leads to a
                    complex design of detectors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Typical detector arrays for sensing the direction of
                    radiation sources are large and expensive and include at
                    least 100 pixels in a 10 by 10 array. However, the group
                    found that using as few as four pixels arranged in the
                    tetromino shapes of the figures in the "Tetris" game can
                    come close to matching the accuracy of the large, expensive
                    systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The key is a proper computerized reconstruction of the
                    angles of arrival of the rays, based on the times each
                    sensor detects the signal and the relative intensity each
                    one detects, as reconstructed through an AI-guided study of
                    simulated systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of the different configurations of four pixels, the
                    researchers tried—square, S-, J- or T-shaped—they found
                    through repeated experiments that the S-shaped array
                    provided the most precise results. This array gave
                    directional readings that were accurate to within about 1
                    degree, but all three of the irregular shapes performed
                    better than the square. This approach, Li says, "was
                    literally inspired by Tetris."
                  </p>

                    [...] In a single-blind field test at the Berkeley Lab with
                    a real cesium radiation source, led by Vavrek, where the
                    researchers at MIT did not know the ground-truth source
                    location, a test device was performed with high accuracy in
                    finding the direction and distance to the source.

                    Intel's current-gen Meteor Lake chips only provide 10 TOPS
                    of performance from the NPU, falling below the bar for
                    next-gen AI PCs. Lunar Lake's 45 TOPS from the NPU meets
                    that bar exactly. Gelsinger didn't elaborate on how much of
                    the remaining 55+ TOPS comes from the CPU and GPU, but it's
                    reasonable to expect in the range of 50 TOPS from the GPU
                    and 5 to 10 FLOPS from the CPU cores.

                    AMD's current-gen Ryzen Hawk Point platform has an NPU with

                Several sites are reporting on the European Court of Human
                Rights' decision that failure to cut greenhouse gas emissions is
                a violation of our basic human rights. Specifically holding
                global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, in line
                with the goals of the Paris climate agreement, is a necessary
                step in preventing the serious, adverse effects on their lives,
                health, well-being, and quality of life which come with the
                direction climate change has been moving.

                    On Tuesday, a group of 2,000 Swiss women won a significant
                    ruling on holding governments accountable for addressing
                    climate change.

                    The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) found that
                    Switzerland failed to implement sufficient climate policies
                    — violating the women's human rights.

                  <p>
                    The case could influence other European countries, as well
                    as other international bodies, in their decisions about the
                    legal ramifications of inadequate climate policies.

                    In a historic judgement, the court ruled that Switzerland's
                    failure to do enough to cut its greenhouse gas emissions
                    breached the rights to life and respect for family and

                    Peregrine falcon populations across North America are
                    heavily contaminated with harmful flame retardants–including
                    those that have been phased out for years—according to a new
                    study
                    <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c10907"

                    Flame retardants are chemicals added to furniture,
                    electronics, and other everyday products to meet
                    flammability standards, though they often do not work as
                    intended. They also migrate out of products they are added
                    to and end up in wildlife and people and many are linked to
                    serious health and environmental harms.

                  <p>
                    "Our results expose the long-term consequences of adding
                    flame retardants to consumer products," said senior author
                    Da Chen, a scientist at Jinan University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "As globally distributed apex predators, the peregrine
                    falcon is the ideal canary in the coal mine for monitoring
                    flame retardant pollution in the environment. Flame
                    retardants phased out a decade ago are still accumulating in
                    these birds and into their eggs, which indicates that the
                    threats of these chemicals to wildlife and people can far
                    outlast their production."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Continued exposure to old flame retardants comes from
                    the release of these chemicals from in-use and discarded
                    products produced before the phase-outs. Further, many flame
                    retardants released from products accumulate up marine and
                    terrestrial food chains over time, making apex predators
                    like peregrine falcons more likely to build up high
                    concentrations in their tissues. The flame retardants also
                    end up in their eggs through maternal transfer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Concentrations of the unregulated halogenated flame
                    retardants measured by the research team stayed constant or
                    declined throughout the study period, suggesting that
                    non-halogenated flame retardants and polymeric flame
                    retardants are more popular as replacements. Unfortunately,
                    those too are increasingly linked to human and wildlife
                    health harms.

                While what appears to be the real name of "Voltage" appears in
                the BBC story, your AC submitter thought it wise to redact that

                    New findings by Johns Hopkins University engineers working
                    with a high-tech simulation of schooling mackerel, offer
                    insight into why fish swim in schools and promise for the
                    design and operation of much quieter submarines and
                    autonomous undersea vehicles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's widely known that swimming in groups provides fish
                    with added protection from predators, but we questioned
                    whether it also contributes to reducing their noise," said
                    senior author Rajat Mittal. "Our results suggest that the
                    substantial decrease in their acoustic signature when
                    swimming in groups, compared to solo swimming, may indeed be
                    another factor driving the formation of fish schools."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The work is
                    <a
                      href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/ad3a4e"
                      >published</a
                    >
                    in <em>Bioinspiration &amp; Biomimetics</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team created a 3D model based on the common mackerel to
                    simulate different numbers of fish swimming, changing up
                    their formations, how close they swam to one another, and
                    the degrees to which their movements synched. The model,
                    which applies to many fish species, simulates one to nine
                    mackerel being propelled forward by their tail fins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team found that a school of fish moving together in just
                    the right way was stunningly effective at noise reduction: A
                    school of seven fish sounded like a single fish.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "A predator, such as a shark, may perceive it as hearing a
                    lone fish instead of a group," Mittal said. "This could have
                    significant implications for prey fish."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The single biggest key to sound reduction, the team found,
                    was the synchronization of the school's tail flapping—or
                    actually the lack thereof.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If fish moved in unison, flapping their tail fins at the
                    same time, the sound added up and there was no reduction in
                    total sound. But if they alternated tail flaps, the fish
                    canceled out each other's sound, the researchers found.

                  <p>
                    According to Tesla lawyer Thomas Branigan, the settlement
                    amount could be perceived "as evidence of Tesla's potential
                    liability for losses, which may have a chilling effect on
                    settlement opportunity in subsequent cases." Branigan said
                    Tesla would suffer serious injury if the settlement amount
                    was not withheld, and his motion appears to have been
                    granted based on court documents.

                  <p>
                    There's plenty of unknowns in a situation like this, in
                    which Tesla chose to settle the matter a mere day before
                    jury selection was set to begin. Nonetheless, it's the first
                    settlement in an Autopilot-related case for Tesla, which so
                    far has prevailed in court on both cases that went before a
                    jury.

                    A leading gravitational wave observatory recently detected
                    ripples in spacetime that scientists say came from the
                    collision of a dead, superdense stellar remnant and an
                    unknown object.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The stellar remnant is what’s called a neutron star; it’s
                    what is left when a massive star collapses, leaving only a
                    dense core behind. Neutron stars are some of the densest
                    objects in the universe, with intense gravitational
                    fields—but not as intense as black holes, whose gravity is
                    so strong that not even light can escape their event
                    horizons.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detected a gravitational wave signal
                    in May 2023, just days after the
                    <a

                    following some upgrades that reduced the amount of noise in
                    the detector, improving its sensitivity to the subtle
                    perturbations of spacetime.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The unique gravitational wave signal travelled 650 million
                    light-years to get to the LIGO Livingston Observatory in
                    Louisiana. Researchers determined the signal came from the
                    merger of two objects. One of the objects was between 1.2
                    and 2 times the mass of our Sun, and the other was about 2.5
                    to 4.5 solar masses. The signal is dubbed GW230529_181500,
                    or GW230529 for short.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The smaller object, the astrophysicists concluded, is
                    probably a neutron star. But the larger object is more
                    massive than any known neutron star, indicating that it may
                    be an itsy-bitsy black hole. Their paper describing the
                    signal and its likely origins is
                    <a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/P2300352/public/"
                      >currently hosted</a
                    >
                    on the LIGO website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The unknown object occupies the apparent mass gap that
                    exists between the heaviest known neutron star and the
                    lightest black hole. Further scrutiny of the collision will
                    indicate whether the unknown object is a low-mass black
                    hole, as the team suspects, or something else.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There are still 80 significant signal candidates that
                    the team needs to sift through. So there are heady days
                    ahead for observing the gravitational universe.

                    In most cases (68 percent), organizations don't deem the
                    incidents significant enough to report to anyone. Other
                    excuses included not knowing where to report incidents (13
                    percent of businesses), thinking a report would make no
                    difference (9 percent), and incidents being too recent to
                    allow time to report (4 percent).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for the action taken, as many as 39 percent of businesses
                    took no action following their most disruptive breach in the
                    previous 12 months. Most defaulted to delivering more
                    training to staff (23 percent), with a much smaller
                    proportion making any changes to

                    (9 percent) or anti-malware solutions (8 percent).

                  <p>
                    Small and micro businesses appear to be pulling the figures
                    down considerably. Overall, 59 percent of businesses enacted
                    some sort of organizational change following a breach, but
                    medium and large businesses were much more likely to take
                    action, with 74 and 86 percent of each respectively doing
                    something to prevent further intrusions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Breaches that resulted in material outcomes for victims,
                    such as the theft of data, led to slightly different
                    results. A greater diversity of measures were enacted by
                    businesses and charities in this case, such as introducing
                    new security tools, but still, 18 percent of businesses did
                    absolutely nothing in response, even after a material
                    breach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In the event of a breach, businesses are not keeping
                    records, not informing the police or regulators, not
                    assessing the scale and impact of the incident," said Kays.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "They are failing to do the bare minimum. It's also
                    important to note that businesses are doing very little to
                    prevent or detect breaches in the first place."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Figures from DSIT's survey also showed a general decrease in
                    awareness of security initiatives and willingness to seek
                    support.

                The invasive cannonball jellyfish is filling fishermen's nets,
                in a surge the environment ministry attributes to warming waters
                from climate change and a decline in jellyfish predators such as
                sharks and sea turtles.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, "sardines and other species that serve as
                fishing bait have disappeared. Fishing is at its lowest level in
                years," said Gustavo Carrasquel, of the NGO Azul Ambientalistas,
                who lives in Choroni, a town neighboring Chuao.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] Globally, jellyfish populations have soared. Researchers
                have warned of a tipping point in which the oceans could go from
                being dominated by fish populations, to jellyfish -- mostly as a
                result of overfishing.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] In Chuao, fishermen who would bring in between 3,000 and
                5,000 kilograms a week have seen their yields drop to between
                500 and 1,000 kilograms, said Douglas Martinez, 44, a fisherman.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mayora said that Venezuela should draw inspiration from
                countries such as Mexico, which exploits jellyfish commercially,
                exporting it to Asian countries where it is used in gastronomy
                or the pharmaceutical industry.

                    [...] Scott Davis, Senior VP of WD's Channel and Regional
                    OEM Sales, likely sent this notification to direct business
                    partners. However, it's certainly just as important for
                    consumers moving into 2024. Higher-than-expected demand
                    combined with supply constraints have pushed us out of the
                    era of dirt-cheap storage now, as was rumored last fall.
                    Hopefully, the increased prices won't last too long.

                    TW's sources point toward HDD pricing increasing by as much
                    as 10%, with a minimum 5% pricing increase expected. There
                    are no hard numbers for NAND flash pricing, but NAND prices
                    were already heading up and we expect further pricing
                    increases could be in line with HDDs, if not worse.

                    Dolphins and whales use sound to communicate, navigate and
                    hunt. New research suggests that the collections of fatty
                    tissue that enable toothed whales to do so may have evolved
                    from their skull muscles and bone marrow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists at Hokkaido University determined DNA sequences
                    of genes which were expressed in acoustic fat
                    bodies—collections of fat around the head that toothed
                    whales use for echolocation. They measured gene expression
                    in the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) and Pacific
                    white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens). Their
                    findings were published in the journal Gene.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The evolution of acoustic fat bodies in the head—the melon
                    in the whale forehead, extramandibular fat bodies (EMFB)
                    alongside the jawbone, and intramandibular fat bodies (IMFB)
                    within the jawbone—was essential for sound use such as
                    echolocation. However, little is known about the genetic
                    origins of those fatty tissues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Toothed whales have undergone significant degenerations and
                    adaptations to their aquatic lifestyle," said Hayate
                    Takeuchi, a Ph.D. student at Hokkaido University's Hayakawa
                    Lab and first author of the study. One adaptation was the
                    partial loss of their sense of smell and taste, along with
                    the gain of echolocation to enable them to navigate in the
                    underwater environment.<br />...<br />"This study has
                    revealed that the evolutionary tradeoff of masticatory
                    muscles for the EMFB—between auditory and feeding
                    ecology—was crucial in the aquatic adaptation of toothed
                    whales," said Assistant Professor Takashi Hayakawa of the
                    Faculty of Environmental Earth Science, who led the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It was part of the evolutionary shift away from chewing to
                    simply swallowing food, which meant the chewing muscles were
                    no longer needed."

                    Canadian telecom Bell Canada has been pushing its
                    cloud-based DVR service to its Fibe TV subscribers for
                    years. While it has given customers advantages, like the
                    ability to view their recordings from more devices, such as
                    phones, compared to using local DVR storage, users don't
                    have as much control over the recordings as they thought
                    they had.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On May 1, Fibe TV will automatically delete recordings
                    stored on its Cloud PVR (personal video recorder) offering
                    once the recordings hit 61 days of age, as confirmed by
                    Canadian online newspaper Daily Hive. Currently, customers
                    maintain access to recordings stored via Cloud PVR for 365
                    days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A Bell Canada spokesperson, Jacqueline Michelis,
                    minimized the idea of disruption to customers, telling Daily
                    Hive: "The viewing of nearly all recordings takes place
                    within 60 days, so there is minimal impact to customers."
                    Michelis didn't provide more details on how Bell Canada
                    arrived at this conclusion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Customers have turned to Bell Canada's online support
                    forum to share their discontent with the changes, with some
                    saying that they don't align with the services they expected
                    to receive when signing up for Fibe TV. Thankfully, Bell
                    Canada won't be able to delete recordings stored on DVR
                    hardware inside customers' homes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other complaints are coming from users whose recordings are
                    being deleted even when they haven't come close to maxing
                    out their cloud storage or if their recordings aren't
                    available on demand.

                    back and observed viscous but not hardened hemolymph oozing
                    from wounds.

                  <p>
                    While bleeding stopped by around a minute, hemocytes started
                    to form a scab around three minutes after the formation of
                    the last drop, which retracted after turning into a
                    viscoelastic fluid with polymers strong enough to thicken it
                    and hold it back. Some hemocytes would form pseudopodia
                    (much like amoebas do), which then attached to other
                    hemocytes. The aggregates that resulted made the fluid more
                    and more viscous and eventually formed a scab.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    Once upon a time, 60 years ago, IBM (International Business
                    Machines) presented a computer architecture that was
                    revolutionary at the time: the IBM System/360. The IBM
                    System/360 was officially unveiled on April 7, 1964, when
                    modern PCs and server technology for supercomputers were
                    still unthinkable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Decades before Windows, 3.5-inch hard disks, CDs or SSDs,
                    IBM had been developing a computer architecture since 1961
                    that the company referred to as the "5 billion dollar
                    gamble". An investment that would either secure IBM's future
                    or destroy the company's specialized computer business. At
                    that time, IBM was producing computers specifically for one
                    application (to put it simply). Upgrades were expensive and
                    required lots of resources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the bet paid off and IBM's System/360 became a success
                    with what are now absurdly puny performance figures by
                    today's standards. The RAM? From 8 KByte as the minimum up
                    to a luxurious 524 KByte as the maximum. This was actually a
                    lot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To put this into perspective: the Atari 2600 console, which
                    appeared over a decade later, had just 128 bytes of RAM.
                    Yes, that's right, 128 characters for the RAM. It wasn't
                    until a few years later that so-called "superchips" in the
                    cartridges made it possible to multiply the RAM. And even
                    then, 20 years later, the basic configuration did not even
                    come close to IBM's System/360.

                    The mission was originally scheduled for liftoff on March 28

                    ULA’s Delta IV Heavy rocket is the last of the Delta family
                    of medium-to-heavy launch vehicles. The Delta legacy dates
                    back to the Cold War, with the first Delta rocket launched
                    on May 13, 1960, from SLC-17 at Cape Canaveral as part of a
                    program developed by the U.S. government to build a suite of
                    expendable launch vehicles to carry payloads ranging from
                    satellites to deep space missions. The rocket family has had
                    388 launches spanning across six decades, evolving over time
                    to become bigger and more advanced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After the Delta chapter comes to a close, ULA’s new Vulcan
                    Centaur rocket is designed to take over. The
                    two-stage-to-orbit, expendable, heavy-lift launch vehicle
                    made its debut in January,

                    [...] "Agricultural diversification has been accused of
                    perhaps being good for biodiversity, but having a few
                    negative aspects too—especially with regards to not being
                    able to achieve sufficiently high yields. But what we
                    actually see, is that there is no reduction in yield from
                    diversified agriculture—not even when we include data from
                    large-scale European agriculture," says Grass.

                    In fact, the figures demonstrate that in the case of small
                    farms and farms with lots of cultivated land in the
                    surroundings, more diversified agriculture can significantly
                    promote food security. This, according to the researchers,
                    could be due to a number of factors.

                    security through improved diet and nutrition. Partly because
                    they eat the fruits themselves, and also because the trees
                    generate extra income when their fruits are sold at
                    market—income that provides small-scale farmers with
                    purchasing power for other foods," says Rasmussen.

                    Engineers have determined why NASA's Voyager 1 probe has
                    been transmitting gibberish for nearly five months, raising
                    hopes of recovering humanity's most distant spacecraft.

                    billion km) from Earth,

                    down to ground controllers on November 14. For nearly four
                    months, NASA knew Voyager 1 was still alive—it continued to
                    broadcast a steady signal—but could not decipher anything it
                    was saying.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Confirming their hypothesis, engineers at NASA's Jet
                    Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California confirmed a small
                    portion of corrupted memory caused the problem. The faulty
                    memory bank is located in Voyager 1's Flight Data System
                    (FDS), one of three computers on the spacecraft. The FDS
                    operates alongside a command-and-control central computer
                    and another device overseeing attitude control and pointing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Flight Data Subsystem was an innovation in
                    computing when it was developed five decades ago. It was the
                    first computer on a spacecraft to use volatile memory. Most
                    of NASA's missions operate with redundancy, so each Voyager
                    spacecraft launched with two FDS computers. But the backup
                    FDS on Voyager 1 failed in 1982.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due to the Voyagers' age, engineers had to reference paper
                    documents, memos, and blueprints to help understand the
                    spacecraft's design details. After months of brainstorming
                    and planning, teams at JPL
                    <a

                    to prompt the spacecraft to send back a readout of the FDS
                    memory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The team suspects that a single chip responsible for
                    storing part of the affected portion of the FDS memory isn’t
                    working,"
                    <a

                      >NASA said in an update</a
                    >
                    posted Thursday. "Engineers can’t determine with certainty
                    what caused the issue. Two possibilities are that the chip
                    could have been hit by an energetic particle from space or
                    that it simply may have worn out after 46 years."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Voyager 1's distance from Earth complicates the
                    troubleshooting effort. The one-way travel time for a radio
                    signal to reach Voyager 1 from Earth is about 22.5 hours,
                    meaning it takes roughly 45 hours for engineers on the
                    ground to learn how the spacecraft responded to their
                    commands.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Although it may take weeks or months, engineers are
                    optimistic they can find a way for the FDS to operate
                    normally without the unusable memory hardware, which would
                    enable Voyager 1 to begin returning science and engineering
                    data again," NASA said.
