                    noted that the company consistently purchased competing
                    repair centers in order to consolidate the sector and force
                    customers into using the company’s own repair facilities,

                    The market isn’t going to fix this problem by itself. It’s
                    clearly going to require a combination of antitrust reform,
                    regulatory action, new state/federal legislation, and
                    meaningful class action penalties before John Deere
                    executives finally get the message. And unfortunately for
                    them, right to repair reform continues to see stunning
                    levels of bipartisan public support.

                    Stealthy and multifunctional Linux malware that has been
                    infecting telecommunications companies went largely
                    unnoticed for two years until being documented for the first
                    time by researchers on Thursday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers from security firm Group-IB have named the
                    remote access trojan “Krasue,” after a nocturnal spirit
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasue"
                      >depicted in Southeast Asian folklore
                    </a>
                    “floating in mid-air, with no torso, just her intestines
                    hanging from below her chin.” The researchers chose the name
                    because evidence to date shows it almost exclusively targets
                    victims in Thailand and “poses a severe risk to critical
                    systems and sensitive data given that it is able to grant
                    attackers remote access to the targeted network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] During the initialization phase, the rootkit conceals
                    its own presence. It then proceeds to hook the
                    <b>`kill()`</b> syscall, network-related functions, and file
                    listing operations, thereby obscuring its activities and
                    evading detection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers have so far been unable to determine
                    precisely how Krasue gets installed. Possible infection
                    vectors include through vulnerability exploitation,
                    credential-stealing or -guessing attacks, or by unwittingly
                    being installed as trojan stashed in an installation file or
                    update masquerading as legitimate software.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Besides the rootkit functions, Krasue features an
                    installation file that's shielded inside a UPX, a so-called
                    packer that provides a cryptographic wrapper around the main
                    executable that can stymie detection by anti-virus software.
                    The Group-IB post provides indicators of compromise and
                    digital characteristics for detecting infected systems.

                    In the case of a captured asteroid origin, however, we are
                    more likely to find material on Phobos that is found on
                    other asteroids in our solar system. The prevailing
                    hypothesis in the #TeamCapture group is that the moons are
                    made up of the same rock as meteorites, called

                    Comparing meteorites and material brought back from Phobos
                    will be a fantastic tool for helping us understand the
                    origin of the two moons. Once we have material in the
                    laboratory, rigorous analytical techniques can be applied to
                    the samples.

                    are already firmly crossed for a successful launch, sample
                    acquisition, and sample return. Many scientists including
                    myself would absolutely love the possibility of one day

                    That means that, in total, emissions from fossil fuels were
                    millions of times higher than carbon removal levels this
                    year. That ratio shows that it's "infeasible" for carbon
                    removal technologies to balance out emissions, O'Sullivan
                    says: "We cannot offset our way out of this problem."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The report also had bad news about nature-based approaches.
                    Efforts to pull carbon out of the atmosphere with methods
                    like reforestation and afforestation (in other words,
                    planting trees) accounted for more emissions removed from
                    the atmosphere than their technological counterparts.
                    However, even those efforts are still being canceled out by
                    current rates of deforestation and other land-use changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The only way to solve this crisis is with major changes to
                    the fossil-fuel industry," O'Sullivan says. Technologies
                    like carbon removal "only become important if emissions are
                    drastically cut as well."

                    <a href="https://toruniversity.eff.org/"
                      >Tor University Challenge</a

                    operate Tor relays. The primary goal of this campaign is to
                    strengthen the Tor network by creating more high bandwidth
                    and reliable Tor nodes. We hope this will also make the Tor
                    network more resilient to censorship since any country or
                    smaller network cutting off access to Tor means it would be
                    also cutting itself off from a large swath of universities,
                    academic knowledge, and collaborations.

                So far they have established contact with more pre-existing
                relays at universities, increased the number of relays in
                general running at universities, and cultivated better contact
                with the national-level university Internet connectivity
                organizations (NRENs). Some of the institutions have established
                public relays, and others even added new exit relays.

                    "The first signal was supposed to fire the mortar and
                    release the drogue," Lauretta said. "The second signal was
                    supposed to cut the cable to release the main... It looks
                    like the first signal cut the (cable), and then the second
                    signal fired the mortar, so it went backwards. But it
                    worked. We had lots of margin on that main chute. It landed
                    safely—a beautiful pinpoint landing in the Utah desert."<br />[...]<br />"In
                    the design plans for the system, the word 'main' was used
                    inconsistently between the device that sends the electric
                    signals, and the device that receives the signals," NASA
                    said in a written statement. "On the signal side, 'main'
                    meant the main parachute. In contrast, on the receiver side
                    'main' was used as a reference to a pyrotechnic that fires
                    to release the parachute canister cover and deploy the

                    provides more concrete information than the old one while

                    by VideoCardz—where it accuses AMD of selling "snake oil" by
                    using older processor architectures in ostensibly "new"

                    The "Core Truths" deck takes particular issue with the Ryzen
                    7020 series, released in late 2022 and into 2023 but using
                    Zen 2-based CPU cores that date back to mid-2019. Intel
                    argues, not inaccurately, that a 13th-generation Core
                    i5-1335U chip can perform much better than a Ryzen 5 7520U,
                    despite both being marketed as recent releases.

                    My first reaction was to basically agree with Intel's
                    overall point; this was easy to do since the company used

                    to back up its argument.<br />[...]<br />My second reaction,
                    arrived at almost simultaneously, was to wonder why Intel
                    was taking so much issue with a practice that Intel itself
                    regularly uses to "refresh" its processor lineups.<br />[...]<br />"Rebranding
                    old technology to make it seem newer" is a trick that
                    practically all big chipmakers have resorted to at one time,
                    and Intel has a particularly rich history with it. The
                    mid-to-late-2010s manufacturing problems that lost Intel its
                    chipmaking technology lead also resulted in a whopping

                    [...] It's clear to me from my experience that this
                    treatment is not made for everyone, though. To receive
                    exa-cel, I spent a total of 17 weeks in the hospital. Not
                    everyone will want to subject themselves to such a grueling
                    process or be able to take time away from family obligations
                    or work. And my treatment was free as part of the trial—if
                    approved, exa-cel could cost millions of dollars per
                    patient.

                    [...] The options for treating sickle cell disease are very
                    limited. Denying access to such a powerful and
                    transformative treatment based on someone's ability to pay,
                    or where they happen to live, strikes me as unethical. I
                    believe patients and health-care providers everywhere
                    deserve to know that the treatment will be available to
                    those who need it.

                    struggle with not knowing the full consequences of my
                    actions. I fundamentally, at a cellular level, changed who I
                    am. Where do we draw the line at playing God? And how do we
                    make the benefits of a God-like technology such as this more

                Just when you thought the Do-Not-Track (DNT) privacy setting was
                gathering dust, a court in Berlin, Germany decided to exhume it.
                The Berlin Regional court ruled in favor of the Federation of
                German Consumer Organization (Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband,
                vzbv), in their lawsuit against LinkedIn for ignoring users who
                had enabled 'Do-Not-Track' in their browsers. According to the
                German judge, companies must respect DNT settings under the
                General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR.

                    worry about who gets access to your personal information in
                    the process.

                  <p>
                    Ideally, websites should only prompt for permissions
                    contextually. For instance, it makes sense to ask for
                    permissions to share data with YouTube when you click play
                    on an embedded YouTube video. Also, well-designed websites
                    would ideally host videos themselves or use embedding
                    services that offer more control over privacy and data
                    collection than Google and its services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also, DNT does have its limitations because of its voluntary
                    nature because at the end of the day, websites can choose
                    whether or not to respect your request. It creates a
                    scenario similar to having a 'Keep Out' sign – some will
                    respect the warning and others will ignore it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, in light of the recent ruling in the Berlin
                    Regional Court against LinkedIn, this is a huge turning
                    point in the DNT initiative. This means LinkedIn can no
                    longer ignore its users' tracking preferences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This ruling potentially creates a legal implication that a
                    DNT signal is legally binding and must be respected by
                    websites.

                    One attraction of Binance, as the company grew from its 2017
                    founding into the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the
                    world, was the firm's freewheeling flouting of rules. As it
                    amassed well over 100 million crypto-trading users globally,
                    it openly told the United States government that, as an
                    offshore operation, it didn't have to comply with the
                    country's financial regulations and money-laundering laws.

                    that Binance's executives had agreed to plead guilty to
                    criminal money-laundering charges, much of the attention on
                    that settlement focused on founder

                    and on the company's record-breaking $4.3 billion fine. But
                    Binance's settlement agreements with the DOJ and the US
                    Treasury Department also stipulate a strict new regime of

                    to law enforcement and regulators without notifying those
                    users. Now, the Binance settlement would create perhaps the
                    most extreme case yet of that crypto exchange data-sharing,
                    giving the US government wholesale access to the records of
                    a crypto hub that at some points processed billions of
                    transactions a day.<br />[...]<br />US law enforcement has
                    proven that even troves of exchange data that lack users'
                    names can nonetheless be highly revealing of their financial
                    history—especially in combination with blockchain data and
                    information from other exchanges that usually do comply with
                    know-your-customer laws. In the case of the

                    A federal bankruptcy court in Florida approved an agreement
                    Nov. 22 whereby SpaceX would acquire Pioneer Aerospace for
                    $2.2 million. The deal was

                    [....] Connecticut-based Pioneer has developed parachutes
                    for space and other applications for decades. That work
                    ranged from parafoils developed in the 1960s for potential
                    use on Gemini spacecraft to parachutes flown on Mars lander
                    missions and the OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule. It also
                    supplied drogue chutes for SpaceX's Crew Dragon and its
                    cargo variant.

                  <p>
                    [....] One industry source, speaking on background, said the
                    deal was likely an effort to preserve SpaceX's supply chain,
                    speculating that the cost to acquire Pioneer out of
                    bankruptcy may have been less than what SpaceX would have
                    spent on finding a new drogue chute supplier and
                    requalifying that component for use on crewed missions.

                    Both SpaceX and Boeing, the other company with a NASA
                    commercial crew contract, struggled to develop parachutes

                (USWDS) guides those building US government web sites, but the
                influence extends much further in practice:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    With such a continuing free-fall, Firefox is inevitably
                    nearing the point where USWDS will remove it, like Internet
                    Explorer before it, from the list of supported browsers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "So what?" you may wonder. "That's just for web developers
                    in the U.S. government. It doesn't affect any other web
                    devs."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Actually, it very well could. Here's how I envision the
                    dominoes falling:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Once Firefox slips below the 2% threshold in the
                      government's visitor analytics, USWDS tells government web
                      devs they don't have to support Firefox anymore.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When that word gets out, it spreads quickly to not only
                      the front-end dev community but also the corporate IT
                      departments for whom some web devs work. Many corporations
                      do a lot of business with the government and, thus,
                      whatever the government does from an IT standpoint is
                      going to influence what corporations do.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Corporations see this change as an opportunity to lower
                      dev costs and delivery times, in that it provides an
                      excuse to remove <em>some</em> testing (and, in rare
                      cases, specific coding) from their development
                      workflow.<sup

                    Firefox — the free/open-source browser that was supposed to
                    save the world from the jackboots of Internet Explorer
                    (which had killed Firefox's ancestor, Netscape Navigator) —
                    is reduced to permanent status as a shrinking part of the
                    fractured miscellany that litters the bottom of browser
                    market-share charts.

              <p>
                It also matters a lot in another way because without push back,
                due to either lack of will or lack of ability, there is not a
                counter balance to Google's Chromium / Chrome and thus the web
                has started to become[<i>sic</i>] under full control of a single
                entity, and a[<i>sic</i>] one which is a corporation at that.

                For those that have been following the saga, the CEO of Mozilla
                Corporation has maneuvered the once great browser from being a
                major presence to being barely a statistical error in market
                share. During that time Mozilla has also shifted from having a
                diverse funding base to being more or less fully financially
                dependent on its most serious competitor, Google.

                    Mr Krupski said he had found evidence in company data which
                    suggested that requirements relating to the safe operation
                    of vehicles that had a certain level of autonomous or
                    assistive-driving technology had not been followed.

                  <p>
                    He added that even Tesla employees had spoken to him about
                    vehicles randomly braking in response to non-existent
                    obstacles - known as "phantom braking". This also came up in
                    the data he obtained around customer complaints.

                  <p>
                    Mr Krupski said he had felt compelled to share what he had
                    found with data protection authorities.

                  <p>
                    The US Department of Justice have been investigating Tesla
                    over its claims relating to its assisted driving features
                    since January.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tesla has also faced similar probes and questions from
                    agencies including the National Highway Traffic Safety
                    Administration about its autopilot system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    German newspaper Handelsblatt published the "Tesla Files"
                    after Mr Krupski shared 100GB of internal data he
                    discovered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The data protection authority in the Netherlands, where
                    Tesla's European headquarters are based, confirmed to the
                    BBC it had been notified of the data breach and was looking
                    into the claim.

                  <p>
                    [... ] Mr Krupski said the last six months and experience of
                    being a whistleblower had been "terrifying".

                  <p>"I barely sleep at night sometimes," he told the BBC.</p>
                  <p>
                    But his actions have been recognised by others - he has been
                    awarded the Blueprint for Free Speech Whistleblowing Prize.

                  <p>
                    Jack Stilgoe, an associate professor at University College
                    London who researches autonomous vehicles, said Mr Krupski's
                    claims raised wider concerns about the technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is a sort of test case of artificial intelligence in
                    the wild, on the open road, surrounded by all the rest of
                    us," he said.

                    The UK Government announced plans for an Automated Vehicles
                    Bill to outline a legal framework for self-driving cars in
                    the King's Speech in early November.

                  <p>
                    "We'll have to see as the bill gets developed whether it
                    grapples with all of the novel things about the technology,"
                    Prof Stilgoe added.

                    Search vs. browse is a false dichotomy, since users employ
                    both strategies to achieve highly overlapping goals. For
                    example, a user looking for men's shoes on an ecommerce site
                    can either type the query "mens shoes" into the search box
                    or browse through the category hierarchy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In fact, the strategies that users employ often depend as
                    much on application design as on their personal preferences.
                    A larger, more prominent search box encourages search, while
                    a more prominent link to to view the category hierarchy
                    encourages browse. Autocomplete design can have a big impact
                    too — particularly the decision of whether or not to present
                    category browse pages as autocomplete suggestions. Also,
                    some applications redirect common keyword queries to browse
                    pages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So we should not assume that users set out to search vs.
                    browse.

                    One of the worse consequences of the sharp distinction
                    between search and browse is that two different teams tend
                    to be responsible for them — and sometimes those teams even
                    compete for glory and resources. Remember: it's not about
                    you or your organization. It's about helping users find what
                    they are looking for. So make sure that your org structure,
                    analytics, and other internal processes don't get in the way
                    of helping your users achieve their goals — through search,
                    browse, or both.

                In the early days of autonomous driving development, there was
                some press about researchers using the "trolley problem" (kill
                one person "on purpose" vs "do nothing" and kill many) to think
                about how robot cars should work. Now researchers at North
                Carolina State U have broken that big moral question down into
                smaller, more mundane pieces, in an attempt to see what ordinary
                human drivers think and do. Press release at:

                <div>
                  <p>
                    ... "The typical situation comprises a binary choice for a
                    self-driving car between swerving left, hitting a lethal
                    obstacle, or proceeding forward, hitting a pedestrian
                    crossing the street. However, these trolley-like cases are
                    unrealistic. Drivers have to make many more realistic moral
                    decisions every day. Should I drive over the speed limit?
                    Should I run a red light? Should I pull over for an
                    ambulance?"<br />[...]<br />"For example, if someone is
                    driving 20mph over the speed limit and runs a red light,
                    then they may find themselves in a situation where they have
                    to either swerve into traffic or get into a collision.
                    There's currently very little data in the literature on how
                    we make moral judgments about the decisions drivers make in
                    everyday situations."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To address that lack of data, the researchers developed a
                    series of experiments designed to collect data on how humans
                    make moral judgments about decisions that people make in
                    low-stakes traffic situations. The researchers created seven
                    different driving scenarios, such as a parent who has to
                    decide whether to violate a traffic signal while trying to
                    get their child to school on time. Each scenario is
                    programmed into a virtual reality environment, so that study
                    participants engaged in the experiment have audiovisual
                    information about what drivers are doing when they make
                    decisions, rather than simply reading about the scenario.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For this work, the researchers built on something called the
                    Agent Deed Consequence (ADC) model, which posits that people
                    take three things into account when making a moral judgment:
                    the agent, which is the character or intent of the person
                    who is doing something; the deed, or what is being done; and
                    the consequence, or the outcome that resulted from the deed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers created eight different versions of each traffic
                    scenario, varying the combinations of agent, deed and
                    consequence. For example, in one version of the scenario
                    where a parent is trying to get the child to school, the
                    parent is caring, brakes at a yellow light, and gets the
                    child to school on time. In a second version, the parent is
                    abusive, runs a red light, and causes an accident. The other
                    six versions alter the nature of the parent (the agent),
                    their decision at the traffic signal (the deed), and/or the
                    outcome of their decision (the consequence).

              <p>
                To date they have done small pilot studies, next is a much
                larger study with thousands of human subjects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Do we want robot cars to make the same routine decisions that
                some average human makes? I think it's a given that following
                some traffic rules (eg, speed limit) to the letter is likely to
                foul up traffic in many situations. How about in other
                situations?

                    Researchers have generally said that state-of-the-art
                    error-correction techniques will require more than 1,000
                    physical qubits for each logical qubit. A machine that can
                    do useful computations would then need to have millions of
                    physical qubits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But in recent months, physicists have grown excited about an
                    alternative error-correction scheme called quantum
                    low-density parity check (qLDPC). It promises to cut that
                    number by a factor of 10 or more, according to a preprint by
                    IBM researchers[1]. The company says it will now focus on
                    building chips designed to hold a few qLDPC-corrected qubits
                    in just 400 or so physical qubits, and then networking those
                    chips together.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The IBM preprint is “excellent theoretical work”, says
                    Mikhail Lukin, a physicist at Harvard University in
                    Cambridge, Massachusetts. “That being said, implementing
                    this approach with superconducting qubits seem to be
                    extremely challenging and it will likely take years before
                    even a proof-of-concept experiment can be tried in this
                    platform,” Lukin says. Lukin and his collaborators conducted
                    similar study on the prospect to implement qLDPC using
                    individual atoms instead of superconducting loops2.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The catch is that the qLDPC technique requires each qubit to
                    be directly connected to at least six others. In typical
                    superconducting chips, each qubit is connected only to two
                    or three neighbours. But Oliver Dial, a condensed-matter
                    physicist and chief technology officer of IBM Quantum, at
                    IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights,
                    New York, says that the company has a plan: it will add a
                    layer to the design of its quantum chips, to allow the extra
                    connections required by the qLDPC scheme.

                  <p>
                    A new IBM road map on the its quantum research unveiled
                    today sees it reaching useful computations — such as
                    simulating the workings of catalyst molecules — by decade’s
                    end. “It’s always been the dream, and it’s always been a
                    distant dream,” says Dial. “Actually having it come close
                    enough that we can see the path from where we are today for
                    me is enormous.”

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                        My car cost $40,000. It's absolutely the nicest,
                roomiest (except for the minivans) car I ever owned. My Dad had
                a Checker when I was about ten, they no longer make them. They
                were designed for taxicabs and I've never seen more back seat
                leg room than in one. My new Hyundai has more leg room except
                Dad's Checker than any other car I've ever seen, and although
                the '74 LeMans was a much bigger car, my new EV is much roomier.
                It's a lot roomier than the '02 Concorde that was the same size
                as my new car on the outside. Why aren't the auto companies
                advertising how roomy EVs are? I never realized how much space
                engines, transmissions, and gas tanks take up.
              </p>
              <p>
                        I started trying to buy one when I realized that you
                don't have to babysit them when you're charging. I didn't want
                to stand there in the snow filling a gas tank, but judging from
                most Facebook comments I've seen, I must be the only one who
                realized that. People seem to think you have to stand there when
                they charge. Why aren't they advertising this benefit?
              </p>
              <p>
                        Why aren't they telling you that your car can now heat
                your garage, unlike a piston car? Why aren't they advertising
                the fact that rather than the heat coming on when you get to
                where you're going, you have heat before you're out of the
                driveway?
              </p>
              <p>
                        Why aren't they telling you how well EVs handle, thanks
                to its crazy low center of gravity? Or how much faster they can
                stop, thanks to having two sets of brakes?
              </p>
              <p>
                        Why aren't they advertising the fact that electricity is
                five times cheaper than gasoline and diesel? The only way I
                found out was by buying one.
              </p>
              <p>
                        Why aren't they advertising all the advantages of EVs?
              </p>
              <p>
                        Why are only the top of the line autos like the Mustang
                or Cadillac EVs? That's an easy question to answer. The
                automakers are under laws from our and other governments that
                their fuel mileage average of all the vehicles they sell has to
                be under a certain number. The easiest way to do that is to make
                the expensive cars, the ones with big V-8s, electric. When your
                fastest car doesn't use traditional fuel...
              </p>
              <p>
                        But this, of course, begs a second question: why only
                the expensive ones? Because they don't want to make electric
                cars at all. The obvious reason is that they hate EVs. But why
                do they hate them and love the incredibly inefficient (my car
                will go 20 miles on the electricity it takes to refine a gallon
                of gasoline), obsolete Rube Goldberg device with thousands of
                moving parts to wear and break?
              </p>
              <p>
                        EVs threaten their business model. The businesses are
                set up so that GM makes almost as much profit from aftermarket
                parts, like spark plugs, belts, hoses, pumps, and so forth as
                they do on the cars themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                        Gasoline and diesel vehicles all need periodic
                maintenance. They're needy things, expensive to maintain, and
                the car company gets a cut of every repair of every car they
                sell. The drive train is a Rube Goldberg mess with thousands of
                moving, interlocking parts, any one of which fails can cripple
                the vehicle. A bad fuel pump stranded me in the bad part of town
                last year, and the repair was nearly $900 not counting the
                towing charge. The repair shop got half, Pontiac and other
                companies got the rest.
              </p>
              <p>
                        My new car doesn't have a fuel pump. Or spark plugs, or
                belts, or fuel injectors, or any of the other moving parts all
                the other cars I've owned since 1968 had and needed replacing.
                The motor's shaft IS its drive train! When was the last time
                your ceiling fan needed servicing?
              </p>
              <p>
                        More than likely that new 1976 Vega that cost $3,000
                garnered more than that for GM in aftermarket parts. There may
                still be some on the road still earning money for GM. An EV has
                few aftermarket parts; tires, brake pads, windshield wiper
                blades are all I can think of. Hyundai won't make any more money
                from my new EV like they would if it had a big six cylinder
                piston engine.
              </p>
              <p>
                        Which is a shame, because electric motors are all far,
                far superior to piston engines and transmissions in every way.
                But the nearly zero cost of maintenance is why the thieving
                billionaire car companies don't want to sell affordable EVs. In
                fact, they want to sell as few EVs as possible. If it wasn't for
                fuel mileage restrictions, Tesla and the Chinese would likely be
                the only electric cars you could buy.
              </p>
              <p>
                        But isn't this just a conspiracy theory? No, there was
                never a conspiracy, nothing needed to be said. Those people
                aren't moral, but they're not stupid, either. Ford and Chevy
                aren't making cars for a hobby, nor are they charitable
                organizations. All they care about is profit, and EVs threaten
                their gravy train.

                    It was back in 2022 when Broadcom, known for designing and
                    manufacturing semiconductor products, announced plans to buy
                    cloud computing and virtualization technology company VMware
                    in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at approximately $61
                    billion. The deal also sees Broadcom assuming VMware's $8
                    billion in debt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Broadcom said it had completed the acquisition of VMware
                    last November 22. As is often the case with mergers, one of
                    the first actions being taken by Broadcom is to implement
                    mass layoffs across the company it's just bought.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] If that isn't enough to anger VMware employees, those
                    who aren't being fired have been given an ultimatum by
                    Broadcom CEO Hock Tan: "If you live within 50 miles of an
                    office, you get your butt in here," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Collaboration is important and a key part of sustaining a
                    culture with your peers, with your colleagues," Tan added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    VMware has long been a remote-friendly company, a stark
                    contrast to Broadcom, which is so anti-work-from-home that
                    it ordered some employees back into the office in April
                    2020, despite California's stay-at-home orders.

                    details a new upgrade to Gmail's spam filters that Google is
                    calling "one of the largest defense upgrades in recent
                    years." The upgrade comes in the form of a new text
                    classification system called RETVec (Resilient &amp;
                    Efficient Text Vectorizer). Google says this can help
                    understand "adversarial text manipulations"—these are emails
                    full of special characters, emojis, typos, and other junk
                    characters that previously were legible by humans but not
                    easily understandable by machines. Previously, spam emails
                    full of special characters made it through Gmail's defenses
                    easily.

                  <p>
                    [...] Google says the efficiency here is a big deal.
                    Alternative approaches that used a "fixed vocabulary size"
                    or "lookup table" for homoglyphs made them very
                    resource-intensive to run. Imagine a list of every possible
                    spelling and misspelling of "congratulations" that swaps out
                    one or more characters for numbers, math symbols, Cyrillic,
                    Hebrew, or emojis and you have a nearly endless list. Google
                    says RETVec is only 200k "instead of millions of
                    parameters," so while Google's spam-filtering cloud is
                    probably big enough to run anything, this is small enough
                    that it could even run on a local device. RETVec
                    <a href="https://github.com/google-research/retvec"
                      >is open source</a
                    >, and Google hopes it will rid the world of homoglyph
                    attacks, so even your local comment section could be running
                    it someday.

                    Spying and surveillance are different but related things. If
                    I hired a private detective to spy on you, that detective
                    could hide a bug in your home or car, tap your phone, and
                    listen to what you said. At the end, I would get a report of
                    all the conversations you had and the contents of those
                    conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put
                    you under surveillance, I would get a different report:
                    where you went, whom you talked to, what you purchased, what
                    you did.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before the internet, putting someone under surveillance was
                    expensive and time-consuming. You had to manually follow
                    someone around, noting where they went, whom they talked to,
                    what they purchased, what they did, and what they read. That
                    world is forever gone. Our phones track our locations.
                    Credit cards track our purchases. Apps track whom we talk
                    to, and e-readers know what we read. Computers collect data
                    about what we're doing on them, and as both storage and
                    processing have become cheaper, that data is increasingly
                    saved and used. What was manual and individual has become
                    bulk and mass. Surveillance has

                    Spying is another matter. It has long been possible to tap
                    someone's phone or put a bug in their home and/or car, but
                    those things still require someone to listen to and make
                    sense of the conversations. Yes, spyware companies like

                    After a spy camera designed to look like a towel hook was
                    purchased on Amazon and illegally used for months to capture
                    photos of a minor in her private bathroom, Amazon was sued.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The plaintiff—a former Brazilian foreign exchange student
                    then living in West Virginia—argued that Amazon had
                    inspected the camera three times and its safety team had
                    failed to prevent allegedly severe, foreseeable harms still
                    affecting her today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Amazon hoped the court would dismiss the suit,

                    that the platform wasn't responsible for the alleged
                    criminal conduct harming the minor. But after nearly eight
                    months deliberating, a judge recently largely denied the
                    tech giant's motion to dismiss.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Amazon's biggest problem persuading the judge was seemingly
                    the product descriptions that the platform approved. An

                    included a photo from Amazon's product listing that showed
                    bathroom towels hanging on hooks that disguised the hidden
                    camera. Text on that product image promoted the spy cams,
                    boasting that they "won't attract attention" because each
                    hook appears to be "a very ordinary hook."

                  <p>
                    Back in 2012, I decided to start this software development
                    blog. Because I am a do-it-yourselfer at heart, instead of
                    using Blogger or WordPress, I sat down and wrote my own blog
                    engine, using a then little known web framework called
                    Flask. I knew I wanted to code it in Python, and I first
                    tried Django, which was the most popular Python web
                    framework at the time. But unfortunately Django seemed too
                    big and too structured for my needs. I've found that Flask
                    gave me as much power, while being small, unopinionated and
                    unobtrusive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Writing my own blog engine was an awesome experience that
                    left me with a lot of ideas for topics I wanted to blog
                    about. Instead of writing individual articles about all
                    these topics, I decided to write a long, overarching
                    tutorial that Python beginners can use to learn web
                    development. And just like that, the Flask Mega-Tutorial was
                    born!

              <p>
                The double burial of an adult woman and an infant, dating to
                about 7000–6800 BCE, discovered in 1934 during construction
                works at the spa gardens of Bad Dürrenberg, is regarded as one
                of the outstanding burial finds of the Mesolithic in Central
                Europe. Because of the unusual equipment with the woman, who was
                buried in a seated position, and her bodily anomalies, the
                burial is interpreted as that of a shaman.
              </p>
              <p>
                Genetic research now reveals the relation of the woman and the
                child: the boy is not her son, but is a fourth- or fifth-degree
                relation. The phenotypic variants analyzed in the woman's genome
                inform us that she had a relatively dark skin complexion, dark,
                straight hair, and blue eyes.
              </p>
              <p>
                The unusual equipment buried with the woman comprises flint
                artifacts and solid rock tools, but also bone and antler
                artifacts, a piece of red ochre, a number of animal bones
                including the shell of at least three terrapins and partly
                pierced animal teeth. Together with deer antlers and originally
                six partly pierced boar's tusks, these finds are probably
                head/body ornaments. Due to the grave goods and bodily anomalies
                of the woman, the burial is interpreted as that of a shaman.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] Subsequent excavations at the site as part of the
                preparations for the State Garden Exhibition 2024 brought not
                only new revelations about the deposition and positioning of the
                body to light, but also revealed a multitude of new finds, which
                could be clearly attributed to the burial. Besides the pierced
                animal teeth, remains of fauna, lithic artifacts and a large
                amount of human skeletal remains could also be recovered.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the base of the skull, there is an anomaly at the edge of the
                great occipital hole, in the form of a small constriction. This
                area is the imprint of an abnormally developed blood vessel. The
                first cervical vertebra is incompletely formed due to a
                congenital growth defect and has only reached 40% of the arch.
                The rounded end of the vertebral arch corresponds to the
                previously observed defect at the large occipital hole.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] This can be caused intentionally by adopting a certain
                head posture. The consequences are unlikely to have been serious
                or hazardous to the person's health. However, it is conceivable
                that a nystagmus, i.e., an involuntary movement of the eyeballs,
                could be caused by the blockage of a blood vessel. This unusual
                feature might have been perceived as uncanny and when initiated
                on purpose may have reinforced or even justified her role as a
                shaman.

                  <p>
                    One of the most important discoveries of condensed matter
                    physics is that electrons lose their individuality in
                    solids. Electric interactions make the electrons combine to
                    form collective units. With enough energy, the electrons can
                    even form composite particles called plasmons with a new
                    charge and mass determined by the underlying electric
                    interactions. However, the mass is usually so large that
                    plasmons cannot form with the energies available at room
                    temperature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pines found an exception. If a solid has electrons in more
                    than one energy band, as many metals do, he argued that
                    their respective plasmons can combine in an out-of-phase
                    pattern to form a new plasmon that is massless and neutral:
                    a demon. Since demons are massless, they can form with any
                    energy, so they may exist at all temperatures. This has led
                    to speculation that they have important effects on the
                    behavior of multi-band metals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Demons' neutrality means that they do not leave a signature
                    in standard condensed matter experiments. "The vast majority
                    of experiments are done with light and measure optical
                    properties, but being electrically neutral means that demons
                    don't interact with light," Abbamonte said. "A completely
                    different kind of experiment was needed."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to Abbamonte, it was no accident that his
                    group discovered the demon "serendipitously." He emphasized
                    that he and his group were using a technique that is not
                    widely employed on a substance that has not been well
                    studied. That they found something unexpected and
                    significant is a consequence of simply trying something
                    different, he believes.

                    [...] In addition to identifying potentially suitable
                    regions, Kamau also determined how production in each
                    individual area could be increased sustainably. "There are
                    two approaches to boosting production," she says. "The first
                    is extensification, which means expanding agricultural
                    areas. The other is intensification, i.e. ramping up
                    cultivation density. Depending on the region, diversified
                    farming practices can help make both extensification and
                    intensification more sustainable. But each approach has its
                    risks."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Which approach is more promising depends on the region in
                    question. Agricultural land in Western Europe, China, parts
                    of India and Brazil as well as Eastern Europe that is
                    already being intensively farmed could benefit from various
                    forms of extensification such as incorporating mixed
                    planting and lowering the cultivation density. While areas
                    in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Brazil, India, Tajikistan
                    as well as Canada, and Australia could benefit from
                    intensification according to the study. Other areas may be
                    suitable for both options, such as most parts of West
                    Africa.

                    Health data campaigners are preparing for a legal challenge
                    to the £330 million ($417 million) procurement of the
                    Federated Data Platform (FDP) by NHS England, awarded to US
                    spy-tech firm Palantir last month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The group led by Foxglove alleges there is no lawful basis
                    to create the FDP, as described in procurement documents,
                    within the current legal directions NHS Digital uses to
                    obtain and share data within the NHS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to NHS England, the "data platform" is the
                    software it plans to use to help NHS organizations collate
                    the operational data currently stored in separate systems in
                    order to help staff access the information they need. This
                    data includes the number of beds in a hospital, the size of
                    waiting lists for elective care services, or the
                    availability of medical supplies. The idea is every hospital
                    trust and integrated care system (ICS) will have their own
                    platform, but they will be able to connect and share
                    information between them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The controversial contract is set to last up to seven years.
                    NHS England said the new data platform would deliver better
                    joined-up care for millions of patients, help tackle waiting
                    lists, and reduce hospital discharge delays. Waiting lists
                    in the country have been at record levels since the
                    pandemic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In a statement to The Guardian, NHS England said it
                    has the legal authority to press ahead with the FDP without
                    further legislation and the legal concerns were "totally
                    incorrect."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An NHS spokesperson told the newspaper: "This letter
                    fundamentally misunderstands how the Federated Data Platform
                    will operate and is totally incorrect in both matters of law
                    and fact. The platform will use only existing data legally
                    collected by the NHS to support direct patient care, which
                    is lawful under all relevant data protection regulations."

                    is now working closely with Francesca, introduced the

                    of the person whose image is used. Both efforts, which

                    But recently, the issue has reached a "tipping point," says
                    Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California,
                    Berkeley, because AI has grown much more sophisticated,
                    making the potential for harm much more serious. "The threat
                    vector has changed dramatically," says Farid. Creating a
                    convincing deepfake five years ago required hundreds of
                    images, he says, which meant those at greatest risk for
                    being targeted were celebrities and famous people with lots
                    of publicly accessible photos. But now, deepfakes can be
                    created with just one image.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Farid says, "We've just given high school boys the mother of
                    all nuclear weapons for them, which is to be able to create
                    porn with [a single image] of whoever they want. And of
                    course, they're doing it."

                    Clarke and Morelle, both Democrats from New York, have
                    reintroduced their bills this year. Morelle's now has 18
                    cosponsors from both parties, four of whom joined after the
                    incident involving Francesca came to light—which indicates
                    there could be real legislative momentum to get the bill
                    passed. Then just this week, Representative Kean, one of the
                    cosponsors of Morelle's bill, released

                    [...] Karen Barker, Head of Policy and Research at abrdn
                    Financial Fairness Trust, said, "It is particularly worrying
                    that many in serious financial difficulties continue to take
                    on debt just to pay for essentials. This group is also more
                    likely to borrow from friends and family, meaning their
                    loved ones may be going without to help keep them warm and
                    fed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Financial hardship has ripple effects through communities,
                    and in a small number of extreme cases, some of these
                    'friends' may actually be loan sharks. With headlines
                    showing January's energy bills are going to increase once
                    again, and government support for energy bills not available
                    this winter, there is a risk that those in serious financial
                    difficulties are going to be forced to fall even further
                    into debt to stay afloat."

                    Processors are driven by a clock, which controls the timing
                    of each step inside the chip. In this blog post, I'll
                    examine the clock-generation circuitry inside the Intel 386
                    processor. Earlier processors such as the 8086 (1978) were
                    simpler, using two clock phases internally. The Intel 386
                    processor (1985) was a pivotal development for Intel as it
                    moved x86 to CMOS (as well as being the first 32-bit x86
                    processor). The 386's CMOS circuitry required four clock
                    signals. An external crystal oscillator provided the 386
                    with a single clock signal and the 386's internal circuitry
                    generated four carefully-timed internal clock signals from
                    the external clock.

                    Animals often use vocalizations to warn of nearby danger to
                    others. While this information is generally intended for
                    members of the same species, other species can eavesdrop on
                    the warnings to use the information for their own benefit.
                    Sentinels are animals that have warning calls so widely
                    understood by others that those other species will form
                    groups with them, relying on the sentinels to provide
                    warnings of danger.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, the family Paridae, which are a group of birds
                    that consist of chickadees, tits, and titmice, are known as
                    sentinels because their alarm call for danger, which
                    fittingly sounds like "chick-a-dee-dee-dee," is understood
                    by most other bird species in their mixed-species flocks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Many animals form mixed-species groups, and the thought is
                    that this is an anti-predator behavior," said Henry Pollock,
                    Executive Director of the Southern Plains Land Trust. "There
                    is safety in numbers, and there is a benefit to surrounding
                    yourself with a more diverse set of eyes and ears. However,
                    you have to be able to understand the information that the
                    others around you give to make use of it."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sentinel calls are so readily understood as a signal for
                    danger that researchers wondered whether species that have
                    never heard the call would still get the message. After a
                    recent study found that birds in the Neotropics were
                    responsive to unfamiliar chickadee alarm calls from North
                    America, researchers at the University of Illinois
                    Urbana-Champaign wanted to expand on this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team sought to test if bird communities across three
                    different continents could understand calls for danger from
                    a sentinel they had never encountered before—the
                    dusky-throated antshrike. Antshrikes are birds widely
                    distributed across Central and South America that often act
                    as sentinels in their mixed-species flocks.

                    in June 2024. A new article
                    <a
                      href="https://www.engadget.com/inside-the-arms-race-between-youtube-and-ad-blockers-140031824.html"

                    >
                    detailing the "arms race" over ad blocking brings up an
                    interesting point regarding the power that YouTube and
                    Chrome have in this battle: a dramatic update advantage over
                    the ad blockers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to hamstringing Chrome's extension platform with
                    no real user-centric justifications, Manifest V3 will also
                    put roadblocks up before extension <em>updates</em>, which
                    will delay an extension developer's ability to quickly
                    respond to changes. YouTube can instantly switch up its ad
                    delivery system, but once Manifest V3 becomes mandatory,
                    that won't be true for extension developers. If ad blocking
                    is a cat-and-mouse game of updates and counter-updates, then
                    Google will force the mouse to slow down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] We've covered this already. But we haven't talked
                    about the other side of the equation: Ad block rules can't
                    be updated quickly anymore. Today, ad blockers and privacy
                    apps can ship filter list updates themselves, often using
                    giant open-source community lists. Manifest V3 will stop
                    this by limiting what Google describes "remotely hosted
                    code." All updates, even to benign things like a filtering
                    list, will need to happen through full extension updates
                    through the Chrome Web Store. They will all be subject to
                    Chrome Web Store reviews process, and that comes with a
                    significant time delay.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Engadget's Anthony Ha interviewed some developers in the
                    filtering extension community, and they described a constant
                    cat-and-mouse game with YouTube. Ghostery's director of
                    product and engineering, Krzysztof Modras, said that YouTube
                    is "adapting [its] methods more frequently than ever before.
                    To counteract its changes to ad delivery and ad blocker
                    detection, block lists have to be updated at minimum on a
                    daily basis, and sometimes even more often. While all
                    players in the space are innovating, some ad blockers are
                    simply unable to keep up with these changes."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When Manifest V3 becomes mandatory, those updates that
                    need to arrive "at minimum on a daily basis" will no longer
                    be an option. Limiting remotely hosted code sounds like a
                    totally reasonable limitation until you realize that. like
                    most Manifest V3 changes, it seems carefully crafted to
                    cripple ad blockers more than other extensions. Is a
                    filtering list update, which is essentially just a list of
                    websites, <em>really</em> something that needs to be limited
                    by the "no remotely hosted code" policy?

                    Already equipped with an impressive sonar system, new
                    research reveals that dolphins have an extra ability that
                    evolves as they mature in the space where their baby
                    whiskers once were. The super sense may help them navigate
                    and find hidden food sources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dolphins' sonar ability, known as echolocation, is fairly
                    legendary in the animal kingdom. This ability is so accurate
                    that the mammals, which are technically whales, can use it
                    to distinguish between a golf ball and a ping-pong ball
                    underwater based on the densities of the two objects. But
                    that's not where the creatures' impressive abilities end.

                    They also have eyes that allow them to see in two directions
                    at once; skin that secretes an antibacterial gel to ward off
                    parasites and barnacles; they can get enough thrust to reach
                    30 mph; and they turn off half their brains at a time in
                    order to get rest. A 2019 study also revealed that they have

                    that grant them protection from antibiotic-resistant
                    bacteria. Now, a new study out of the University of Rostock
                    (UR) in Germany adds another impressive skill to the
                    dolphin's roster of powers: the ability to sense weak
                    electric fields.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Two UR researchers took a closer look at the small pits that
                    are left behind after young bottlenose dolphins shed the
                    thin whiskers they are born with. They realized that the
                    pits looked like the same structures that allow sharks to
                    detect electrical fields and designed a study to see if they
                    functioned the same way for the dolphins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They first trained two dolphins at the Nuremberg Zoo to rest
                    their jaws on a metal bar submerged in a pool. Then, they
                    trained them to swim away whenever they sensed an electrical
                    current being produced just above their snouts. One dolphin
                    was able to sense signals down to those measuring just 5.5
                    microvolts/cm, while the other was even more sensitive,
                    picking on a current measuring 2.4 microvolts/cm. One
                    microvolt is equal to one millionth of a volt.

                which has the south end up and uses the Equal Earth projection
                to ensure proportional land-mass size. In other words, the globe
                has been rotated to 150° and created in a multi-stage process
                mostly using R. The borders are from Natural Earth, the country
                names from OpenStreetMap, and flags from Twemoji.

                    Natural Earth only provides country names in English ☹ - but
                    it also provides 2 character ISO codes. So I grabbed the
                    country codes and names from
                    <a
                      href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim/Country_Codes"

                    >
                    and merged them into the data set using R.
                  </p>
                  <p>The Code</p>
                  <p>
                    This produces the country borders and names onto an SVG.
                  </p>
                  <p>Manual placement</p>
                  <p>
                    I used <a href="https://boxy-svg.com/">Boxy</a> to edit the
                    SVG and place all names in roughly the right place.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Inkscape was used to open the resultant SVG at 72dpi. I then
                    used Gimp to autocrop, canvas expanded to 16000x9000, and
                    saved as an <em>uncompressed</em> PNG.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Emoji wouldn't import to either Gimp or Inkscape. So I
                    viewed the file in Firefox and then printed it to a PDF.
                    That PDF was cropped using
                    <a href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pdfcrop">pdfcrop`</a> and
                    then imported to Gimp.

                    In what is a hugely promising sign for securing and boosting
                    food production, a large-scale field study has demonstrated
                    how treating farmland soil with mycorrhizal fungi can
                    improve crop yields of maize by 40%, without the use of any
                    additional fertilizers or pesticides.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the Swiss study, researchers mixed Arbuscular mycorrhizal
                    fungi (AMF) into soil, prior to sowing, at 800 trial plots
                    on 54 maize farms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This fungi occurs naturally in healthy soil and penetrates
                    the roots of plants to form tree-like structures
                    (arbuscules). When they branch out, they increase the
                    plant's root surface area and therefore bolster nutrient
                    uptake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "On a quarter of the plots, the mycorrhizal fungi enabled up
                    to 40% better yields," said the study's co-lead, Marcel van
                    der Heijden, a soil ecologist at the University of Zurich
                    and at agricultural research center Asgroscope. "That's
                    huge."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Investigating why a third showed little increase or even a
                    decrease in yield, the researchers found that healthy soil
                    produced the same (or, in some instances, lower) yields.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We discovered that the inoculation functioned best when
                    there were lots of fungal pathogens already in the soil,"
                    said co-first author Stefanie Lutz from Agroscope.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fungi are thought to provide a first line of defense for
                    the soil, warding off plant-attacking pathogens that can
                    greatly reduce crop yields. As a result, yields could be
                    maintained in fields with pathogens that would have
                    experienced losses without the fungi, while the beneficial
                    effect of the fungi on yields was lower in fields without
                    pathogen contamination. As beneficial organisms, they also
                    help the plants take on nutrients from the soil.

                better than to fill out a Microsoft LinkedIn profile was not

                example, over 12,000 Microsoft employees now currently work
                inside the advertising and data giant Google. IBM seems it might

                    Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, believes it might take the U.S.
                    up to two decades to become self-reliant in chip
                    manufacturing. This statement comes from the head of the
                    company that has historically relied on chip production in
                    Taiwan, and significant efforts by the U.S. and Europe to
                    localize the crucial industry. However, the chip industry is
                    clearly expanding in America at a rate unseen in decades, so

                    [...] Huang noted that Nvidia's products rely
                    on plenty of components that come from different parts of
                    the world, and he does not see all of them produced in the
                    U.S. any time soon. Therefore, his assessments highlight the
                    company's current reliance on international supply chains
                    and the complexity and extent of the global chip industry.

                    A report from Canalys forecasts that the nearly
                    two-year-long decline in PC shipments will finally end in Q4
                    of this year, flipping to a projected 5% growth. More growth
                    is also projected to arrive next year, which will supposedly
                    see 8% higher PC shipments than in 2023. Canalys expects the
                    surging interest in AI and the arrival of ARM-equipped PCs
                    to fuel this growth.

                    [...] A key assumption of this forecast is that new AI
                    software and hardware will re-spark consumer interest in
                    PCs. Canalys predicts that AI-powered PCs will account for
                    19% of all PCs shipped in 2024, a figure that includes

                    PCs with ARM chips are also expected to play an important
                    role in the recovery of the PC market. Although Apple's M
                    CPUs use the ARM architecture, Canalys pointed out
                    Qualcomm's

                    previously predicted ARM chips would grab

                    Of course, the health of the global economy is perhaps the
                    biggest factor in whether consumers buy PCs. The decline of
                    shipments in 2022 and 2023 was precipitated largely on
                    potential buyers being more frugal with their money. The
                    report only touches on this and merely mentions there is "an
                    improving macroeconomic environment." Assuming this recovery
                    of the economy persists into 2024, then it could carry the
                    PC market along.

                    [...] The team at NASA is currently running tests to better

                    gyroscopes during Hubble’s fifth and final space shuttle
                    servicing mission in 2009. Out of these, three remain
                    operational, including the one currently exhibiting
                    fluctuations. While Hubble operates most efficiently using
                    three gyroscopes, it can continue its scientific
                    observations with only one if required.

                    NASA anticipates that the telescope will not only recover
                    from this setback but also continue to work in tandem with
                    other observatories, such as the James Webb Space Telescope.
                    This collaboration is expected to extend throughout this
                    decade and possibly into the next, ensuring Hubble’s ongoing
                    contribution to our understanding of the cosmos.

                    A prolific espionage hacking group with ties to China spent
                    over two years looting the corporate network of NXP, the
                    Netherlands-based chipmaker whose silicon powers
                    security-sensitive components found in smartphones,
                    smartcards, and electric vehicles, a news outlet has

                    The intrusion, by a group tracked under names including
                    "Chimera" and "G0114," lasted from late 2017 to the
                    beginning of 2020,

                    including Microsoft and Dropbox to receive data stolen from
                    the networks of semiconductor makers, including one in
                    Europe that was hit in "early Q4 2017." Some of the
                    intrusions lasted as long as three years before coming to
                    light. NRC said the unidentified victim was NXP.<br />[...]<br />NXP
                    did not alert customers or shareholders to the intrusion,
                    other than a brief reference in a 2019 annual report.<br />[...]<br />Some
                    security researchers said it was surprising that NXP
                    officials didn't inform customers of the two-year intrusion
                    by threat actors, often abbreviated as TAs.

                    The tech giant is going to be getting rid of them, starting
                    from Friday, under its inactive account policy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company said it would take a phased approach, starting
                    with accounts that "were created and never used again".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Simply signing into an account or sending an email should be
                    enough to keep it active.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google said the change was because of security reasons,
                    highlighting that forgotten and unused accounts are more
                    likely to be compromised.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Google account gives users access to most Google products,
                    such as email service Gmail and video sharing site YouTube,
                    using the same username and password.

                      >In a blog post in May</a
                    >, the tech giant said the reason old accounts are more
                    vulnerable is because they tend to rely on old or re-used
                    passwords and largely have not had two-factor authentication
                    set up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once an account has been abused, it can be used for anything
                    from identity theft to malicious content and spam.
