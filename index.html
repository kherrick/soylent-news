                <div>
                  <p>
                    [...] In contrast to the Defcon subway-hacking blowup of
                    2008—and in a sign of how far companies and government
                    agencies have come in their relationship with the
                    cybersecurity community—the four hackers say the MBTA didn't
                    threaten to sue them or try to block their Defcon talk.
                    Instead, it invited them to the transit authority
                    headquarters earlier this year to deliver a presentation on
                    the vulnerabilities they'd found. Then the MBTA politely
                    asked that they obscure part of their technique to make it
                    harder for other hackers to replicate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The hackers say the MBTA hasn't actually fixed the
                    vulnerabilities they discovered and instead appears to be
                    waiting for an entirely new subway card system that it plans
                    to roll out in 2025. When WIRED reached out to the MBTA, its
                    director of communications, Joe Pesaturo, responded in a
                    statement that "the MBTA was pleased that the students
                    reached out and worked collaboratively with the fare
                    collection team."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] So are all four of them using their
                    CharlieCard-hacking technique to roam the Boston subway
                    system for free? "No comment."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For now, the hacker team is just happy to be able to give
                    their talk without the heavy-handed censorship that the MBTA
                    attempted with its lawsuit 15 years ago. Harris argues that
                    the MBTA likely learned its lesson from that approach, which
                    only drew attention to the hackers' findings. "It's great
                    that they're not doing that now—that they're not shooting
                    themselves in the foot. And it's a lot less stressful for
                    everyone," Harris says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He's also glad, on the other hand, that the MBTA took such a
                    hardline approach to the 2008 talk that it got his attention
                    and kickstarted the group's research almost a decade and a
                    half later. "If they hadn't done that," Harris says, "we
                    wouldn't be here."

              <p>
                In 2020 Microsoft laid off dozens of journalists, in a move to
                rely on artificial intelligence. Those journalists were
                responsible for selecting content for Microsoft platforms,
                including MSN and the Edge browser. A recent tourism article now
                reminds us of that earlier business decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                Published last week and titled "Headed to Ottawa? Here's what
                you shouldn't miss!" the article listed 15 must-see attractions
                for visitors to the Canadian capital. Microsoft has since
                removed the article that advised tourists to visit the
                "beautiful" Ottawa Food Bank on an empty stomach. That appears
                to be an out-of-context rewrite of a paragraph on the food
                bank's website. "Life is challenging enough," it says. "Imagine
                facing it on an empty stomach."
              </p>
              <p>
                The remainder of the must-see list was rife with errors. It
                featured a photo of the Rideau River in an entry about the
                Rideau Canal, and a photo of the Rideau Canal in an entry about
                Parc Omega near Montebello, Quebec. It advised tourists to enjoy
                the pristine grass of "Parliament Hills."
              </p>
              <p>
                The article carried the byline "Microsoft Travel." There is
                nothing on the page that identifies it as the product of AI.
                Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment
                on how the article was generated. While now removed, it is still
                available via the Internet Archive.<br /><a

                    U.S. spy agencies will share more intelligence with U.S.
                    companies, nongovernmental organizations and academia under
                    a new strategy released this week that acknowledges concerns
                    over new threats, such as another pandemic and increasing
                    cyberattacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The National Intelligence Strategy, which sets broad goals
                    for the sprawling U.S. intelligence community, says that spy
                    agencies must reach beyond the traditional walls of secrecy
                    and partner with outside groups to detect and deter
                    supply-chain disruptions, infectious diseases and other
                    growing transnational threats.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The intelligence community "must rethink its approach to
                    exchanging information and insights," the strategy says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The U.S. government in recent years has begun sharing vast
                    amounts of cyber-threat intelligence with U.S. companies,
                    utilities and others who are often the main targets of
                    foreign hackers, as well as information on foreign-influence
                    operations with social-media companies.

                    [...] Illustrating the changing threats, a senior U.S.
                    official said that the daily intelligence briefing prepared
                    for President Biden and his top advisers—once dominated by
                    terrorism and the Middle East—now regularly covers topics as
                    varied as China's artificial-intelligence work, the
                    geopolitical impacts of climate change, and semiconductor
                    chips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The 16-page document, which contains no budget or
                    program details, also says spy agencies must support the
                    U.S. in its competition with authoritarian governments such
                    as China and Russia, particularly in technological arenas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On transnational threats such as financial crises, narcotics
                    trafficking, supply-chain disruption and infectious
                    diseases, the document calls on intelligence agencies to
                    strengthen their internal capabilities to warn U.S.
                    policymakers of looming threats.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The emphasis on greater intelligence sharing is part
                    of a broader trend toward declassification that the Biden
                    administration has pursued. The United States has released
                    unprecedented levels of formerly secret intelligence to warn
                    of Russia's plans in Ukraine and its quest for weapons from
                    China, Iran and North Korea.

                    But although the new study's "approach is quite
                    interesting," the fertility link poses a new puzzle, says
                    geneticist Tábita Hünemeier at the University of São Paulo.
                    The fertility boost is "so great" that natural selection
                    should have led to a much higher frequency of
                    <em>APOE4</em> in the Tsimané, she suggests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Alzheimer's and heart disease rates are low even among older
                    Tsimané people, perhaps because of their active lifestyle,
                    Trumble's group has reported. But he says
                    <em>APOE4</em> could still have detrimental effects that
                    balance the benefits—it may reduce fertility in men, for
                    example, or decrease child survival. "Our next step is to
                    figure out whether there are disadvantages at certain life
                    stages," he says.

                    are plotting for mankind’s return to the lunar surface over
                    the next decade. Unlike the days of Apollo, the modern-day
                    race to the Moon involves establishing a sustainable
                    presence and a thriving economy on and around Earth’s
                    natural satellite.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an attempt to guide ongoing efforts in establishing a
                    lunar infrastructure, the Defense Advanced Research Projects
                    Agency (DARPA) kicked off a seven-month study dedicated to
                    developing an analytical framework for scientific and
                    commercial activity on the Moon. Through the 10-Year Lunar
                    Architecture, or LunA-10, study, DARPA is seeking ideas for
                    technology and infrastructure concepts that could help build
                    a Moon-based economy within the next decade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “A large paradigm shift is coming in the next 10 years for
                    the lunar economy,” Michael Nayak, program manager at
                    DARPA’s Strategic Technology Office, said in a
                    <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2023-08-15"
                      >statement</a
                    >. “To get to a turning point faster, LunA-10 uniquely aims
                    to identify solutions that can enable multi-mission lunar
                    systems – imagine a wireless power station that can also
                    provide comms and navigation in its beam.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Luna-10 will select a group of companies that have an
                    idea for lunar services, allowing them to work together to
                    develop an integrated system for lunar communication,
                    energy, transmission or other building blocks necessary to
                    create a future economy on the Moon. The participating
                    companies will be announced in October 2023, with the final
                    report due by June 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    DARPA, however, will not fund the construction or
                    transportation of any of the concepts developed as part of
                    the study. Instead, the agency will provide its “economic
                    expertise to all LunA-10 teams to help analyze and validate
                    definitions of a critical mass to create a thriving,
                    survivable lunar economy,” DARPA wrote in its statement.

                    Russia's unmanned Luna-25 spacecraft has crashed into the
                    Moon after spinning out of control, officials say.

                  <p>It was Russia's first Moon mission in almost 50 years.</p>
                  <p>
                    The craft was due to be the first ever to land on the Moon's
                    south pole, but failed after encountering problems as it
                    moved into its pre-landing orbit.

                    [...] Roscosmos, Russia's state space corporation, said on
                    Sunday morning that it had lost contact with the Luna-25
                    shortly after 14:57pm (11:57 GMT) on Saturday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Preliminary findings showed that the 800kg lander had
                    "ceased to exist as a result of a collision with the surface
                    of the Moon", it said in a statement.

                    ChatGPT, OpenAI's fabulating chatbot, produces wrong answers
                    to software programming questions more than half the time,
                    according to a study from Purdue University. That said, the
                    bot was convincing enough to fool a third of participants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Purdue team analyzed ChatGPT's answers to 517 Stack
                    Overflow questions to assess the correctness, consistency,
                    comprehensiveness, and conciseness of ChatGPT's answers. The
                    US academics also conducted linguistic and sentiment
                    analysis of the answers, and questioned a dozen volunteer
                    participants on the results generated by the model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our analysis shows that 52 percent of ChatGPT answers are
                    incorrect and 77 percent are verbose," the team's paper
                    concluded. "Nonetheless, ChatGPT answers are still preferred
                    39.34 percent of the time due to their comprehensiveness and
                    well-articulated language style." Among the set of preferred
                    ChatGPT answers, 77 percent were wrong.

                    OpenAI on the ChatGPT website acknowledges its software "may
                    produce inaccurate information about people, places, or
                    facts." We've asked the lab if it has any comment about the

                    is titled, "Who Answers It Better? An In-Depth Analysis of
                    ChatGPT and Stack Overflow Answers to Software Engineering
                    Questions." It was written by researchers Samia Kabir, David
                    Udo-Imeh, Bonan Kou, and assistant professor Tianyi Zhang.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "During our study, we observed that only when the error in
                    the ChatGPT answer is obvious, users can identify the
                    error," their paper stated. "However, when the error is not
                    readily verifiable or requires external IDE or
                    documentation, users often fail to identify the
                    incorrectness or underestimate the degree of error in the
                    answer."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even when the answer has a glaring error, the paper stated,
                    two out of the 12 participants still marked the response
                    preferred. The paper attributes this to ChatGPT's pleasant,
                    authoritative style.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "From semi-structured interviews, it is apparent that polite
                    language, articulated and text-book style answers,
                    comprehensiveness, and affiliation in answers make
                    completely wrong answers seem correct," the paper explained.

                    A new study finds a chemical formed when we digest a widely
                    used sweetener is "genotoxic," meaning it breaks up DNA. The
                    chemical is also found in trace amounts in the sweetener
                    itself, and the finding raises questions about how the
                    sweetener may contribute to health problems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At issue is sucralose, a widely used artificial sweetener.
                    Previous work by the same research team established that
                    several fat-soluble compounds are produced in the gut after
                    sucralose ingestion. One of these compounds is
                    sucralose-6-acetate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our new work establishes that sucralose-6-acetate is
                    genotoxic," says Susan Schiffman, corresponding author of
                    the study and an adjunct professor in the joint department
                    of biomedical engineering at North Carolina State University
                    and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "We
                    also found that trace amounts of sucralose-6-acetate can be
                    found in off-the-shelf sucralose, even before it is consumed
                    and metabolized.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To put this in context, the European Food Safety Authority
                    has a threshold of toxicological concern for all genotoxic
                    substances of 0.15 micrograms per person per day," Schiffman
                    says. "Our work suggests that the trace amounts of
                    sucralose-6-acetate in a single, daily sucralose-sweetened
                    drink exceed that threshold. And that's not even accounting
                    for the amount of sucralose-6-acetate produced as
                    metabolites after people consume sucralose."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "In short, we found that sucralose-6-acetate is
                    genotoxic, and that it effectively broke up DNA in cells
                    that were exposed to the chemical," Schiffman says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This work raises a host of concerns about the
                    potential health effects associated with sucralose and its
                    metabolites. It's time to revisit the safety and regulatory
                    status of sucralose, because the evidence is mounting that
                    it carries significant risks. If nothing else, I encourage
                    people to avoid products containing sucralose. It's
                    something you should not be eating."

                    Debian is the beating "heart" of gLinux Rodete, the Linux OS
                    internally run by Google, it provided a very convenient way
                    (free as "free in beer") to build some of the most massive
                    cloud infrastructures available today (AWS), and of course
                    it was used as the foundation of Ubuntu.

                    Nowadays, Ubuntu Linux formally is the most popular free OS
                    with a 33.9% market share, while Debian gets the second
                    place with a 16% share. And then there's the ginormous
                    Chinese market, where Beijing authorities promoted a program
                    to replace Windows with Linux. Chinese users adopted Kylin,

                Estrogen can harm aquatic plants and animals when passed into
                waterways via human and agricultural waste streams. Researchers
                have now developed a new way of removing the hormone from water,
                however, using what's known as "smart rust."
              </p>
              <p>
                Developed by scientists at Germany's University of
                Erlangen-Nuremberg, smart rust takes the form of spherical iron
                oxide (aka rust) nanoparticles that are covered in phosphonic
                acid molecules. The molecules protrude from the surface of the
                spheres like hairs. By binding different compounds to the ends
                of those hairs, it's possible to make them adsorb different
                types of waterborne pollutants.
              </p>
              <p>
                The iron oxide particles themselves are superparamagnetic,
                meaning they're attracted to magnets but not to one another.
                This quality keeps them from clumping together – so they can be
                thoroughly mixed into tainted water – while also making it
                possible to subsequently remove them from that water simply by
                swirling a magnet through the liquid.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] Due to the fact that estrogen molecules consist of a large
                steroid body with a slight negative charge, he coated smart rust
                particles with two types of molecules. One of these has
                particularly long "hairs," while the other is positively
                charged. When combined on the surface of the iron oxide spheres,
                these molecules form multitudes of estrogen-trapping pockets.
              </p>
              <p>
                When tested on water spiked with estradiol, which is the most
                potent type of estrogen, the new form of smart rust successfully
                removed the hormone from that water. Further research will now
                explore how well the technology works in real-world conditions,
                and how many times the particles can be reused.

                    this week alleging that a company that makes price-setting
                    software for apartments and nine of the nation's biggest
                    property managers formed a cartel to artificially inflate
                    rents in violation of federal law.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit was filed days after

                    >
                    raising concerns that the software, sold by Texas-based
                    RealPage, is potentially pushing rent prices above
                    competitive levels, facilitating price-fixing, or both.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The proposed class-action lawsuit was filed in US District
                    Court in San Diego.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an email, a RealPage representative said that the company
                    "strongly denies the allegations and will vigorously defend
                    against the lawsuit." She declined to comment further,
                    saying the company does not comment on pending litigation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The lawsuit accused the property managers and RealPage
                    of forming "a cartel to artificially inflate the price of
                    and artificially decrease the supply and output of
                    multifamily residential real estate leases from competitive
                    levels."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    RealPage's software uses an algorithm to churn through a
                    trove of data each night to suggest daily prices for
                    available rental units. The software uses not only
                    information about the apartment being priced and the
                    property where it is located, but also private data on what
                    nearby competitors are charging in rents. The software
                    considers actual rents paid to those rivals—not just what
                    they are advertising, the company told ProPublica.

                    Google has been testing several ways to combat users who use
                    ad-blockers on its YouTube video streaming site. One of the
                    first tests informed users that
                    <a
                      href="https://www.ghacks.net/2023/05/11/youtube-is-blocking-ad-blockers-to-push-premium-subscription/"
                      >ad blockers are not allowed on YouTube</a
                    >. The prompt, which blocks access to the site, offers three
                    options to users to react to it. The two prominent ones are
                    to configure the content blocker to allow ads on YouTube or
                    to subscribe to the paid service YouTube Premium.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A small close icon in the top right corner is the third and
                    less focused option. Users have the option to click on the
                    x-icon to close the prompt and continue using YouTube.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, it appears, Google is making this option less
                    attractive to users on the site. Instead of displaying the
                    close icon directly, YouTube is now showing a timer in its
                    place. In other words: users who get the prompt have to wait
                    between 30 to 60 seconds before they can close the entire
                    prompt and start using the site.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The notification appears to hit users of different content
                    blockers, including uBlock Origin. It seems that the
                    majority of users are not getting these prompts, likely
                    because Google is still testing reception and the rate of
                    return.

                When NASA's Psyche probe launches in October on its mission to a
                metal asteroid as much as 309 million miles (497 million km)
                from Earth, it will be carrying a new laser communications
                system that promises to revolutionize deep space missions.<br />...<br />By
                relying on old-fashioned X-band radio systems, crewed and
                robotic missions suffer from bandwidths and transmission speeds
                that are ridiculously small and slow. A single high resolution
                image from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter can take an hour
                and a half to send and the data from the New Horizons
                spacecraft's flyby of Pluto took 16 days to download.
              </p>
              <p>
                In light of this, NASA has been experimenting with using lasers
                as a way to not only create much faster direct links between
                space missions and Earth, but also to free up the Deep Space
                Network (DSN) of antennas for more important tasks than routine

                    When Intel joined the discrete GPU market almost a year ago,
                    everyone wondered when it would catch up with Nvidia and
                    AMD. As of August 2023, it apparently has, at least in one
                    respect; like its competitors, Intel has introduced a
                    telemetry collection service by default in the latest beta
                    driver for its Arc GPUs. You can opt out of it, but we all
                    know most people just click "yes" to everything during a
                    software installation. Intel's release notes for the drivers
                    don't mention this change to how its drivers work, which is
                    a curious omission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    News of Intel adding telemetry collection to its drivers is
                    a significant change to how its GPU drivers work. Intel has
                    even given this new collation routine a cute name—the Intel
                    Computing Improvement Program. Gee, that sounds pretty
                    wonderful. We want to improve our computing, so let's dive
                    into the details briefly.
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techpowerup.com/312122/psa-intel-graphics-drivers-now-collect-telemetry-by-default"
                      >According</a
                    >
                    to TechPowerUp, which discovered the change, Intel has
                    created a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/topics/idsa-cip.html"
                      >landing page</a
                    >
                    for the program that explains what is collected and what
                    isn't. At a high level, it states, "This program uses
                    information about your computer's performance to make
                    product improvements that may benefit you in the future."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Though this sounds like an egregious overreach
                    regarding the type of data captured, to be fair to Intel, it
                    allows you to opt out of this program. That is apparently
                    not the case with Nvidia, which doesn't even ask for
                    permission at any point during driver installation,
                    according to TechPowerUp. AMD, on the other hand,
                    <em>does</em> give you a choice to opt out like Intel does,
                    regardless of what other options you choose during
                    installation, and even provides an explainer about what it's
                    collecting.

                    Thousands of websites belonging to US government agencies,
                    leading universities, and professional organizations have
                    been hijacked over the last half decade and used to push
                    scammy offers and promotions, new research has found. Many
                    of these scams are aimed at children and attempt to trick
                    them into downloading apps, malware, or submitting personal
                    details in exchange for nonexistent rewards in

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For more than three years, security researcher Zach Edwards
                    has been tracking these website hijackings and scams. He
                    says the activity can be linked back to the activities of
                    affiliate users of one advertising company. The
                    US-registered company acts as a service that sends web
                    traffic to a range of online advertisers, allowing
                    individuals to sign up and use its systems. However, on any
                    given day, Edwards, a senior manager of threat insights at
                    <a href="https://www.humansecurity.com/">Human Security</a>,
                    uncovers scores of .gov, .org, and .edu domains being
                    compromised.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The schemes and ways people make money are complex,
                    but each of the websites is hijacked in a similar way.
                    Vulnerabilities or weaknesses in a website's backend, or its
                    content management system, are exploited by attackers who
                    upload malicious PDF files to the website. These documents,
                    which Edwards calls “poison PDFs,” are designed to show up
                    in search engines and promote “free Fortnite skins,”
                    generators for Roblox’s in-game currency, or cheap streams
                    of Barbie, Oppenheimer, and other popular films.

                    The new law behind the ban, signed by Governor Kim Reynolds,
                    is part of a wave of educational reforms that Republican
                    lawmakers believe are necessary to protect students from
                    exposure to damaging and obscene materials. Specifically,
                    <a

                    >
                    mandates that every book available to students in school
                    libraries be "age appropriate" and devoid of any
                    "descriptions or visual depictions of a sex act," per Iowa
                    Code 702.17.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But banning books is hard work, according to administrators,
                    so they need to rely on machine intelligence to get it done
                    within the three-month window mandated by the law. "It is
                    simply not feasible to read every book and filter for these
                    new requirements," said Bridgette Exman, the assistant
                    superintendent of the school district, in a statement quoted
                    by The Gazette. "Therefore, we are using what we believe is
                    a defensible process to identify books that should be
                    removed from collections at the start of the 23-24 school
                    year."

                    [...] "There's something ironic about people in charge of
                    education not knowing enough to critically determine which
                    books are good or bad to include in curriculum, only to
                    outsource the decision to a system that can't understand
                    books and can't critically think at all," Dr. Margaret

                    Desert ants have outstanding navigational skills. They live
                    in the saltpans of North Africa, an extremely inhospitable
                    environment. To find food for their nest mates, foraging
                    ants have to walk far into the desert. Once they have found
                    food, for example a dead insect, their actual problem
                    begins: How do they find their way back to their nest as
                    quickly as possible in the extremely hot and barren
                    environment? "The desert ant
                    <em>Cataglyphis fortis</em> stands out due its remarkable
                    ability to successfully navigate and forage in even the
                    harshest environments, making it an excellent subject for
                    studying the intricacies of navigation. With an innate
                    navigation mechanism called path integration, these ants use
                    both a sun compass and a step counter to measure the
                    distances they cover. In addition, they possess the ability
                    to learn and utilize visible and olfactory cues. We believe
                    that this extremely harsh habitat has led, during evolution,
                    to a navigation system of unsurpassed precision," said
                    Marilia Freire, the study's lead author, summarizing what is
                    known so far about the amazing orientation skills of these
                    small animals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The scientists had noticed during previous studies in
                    Tunisia that the nests in the center of the saltpans, where
                    there are hardly any visible landmarks, had high mounds at
                    the nest entrances. In contrast, nest hills near the
                    shrub-covered edges of the saltpans were lower or barely
                    noticeable. So the research team has wondered for some time
                    if these visible differences serve a purpose in helping the
                    ants better find their way home. "It's always hard to tell
                    whether an animal does something on purpose or not. The high
                    nest mounds in the middle of the saltpans could have been a
                    side effect of differences in soil structure or wind
                    conditions. However, crucial for our study was the idea to
                    remove the mounds and to provide some nests with artificial
                    landmarks and others not, and to observe what would happen,"
                    Markus Knaden, head of the Project Group Odor-guided
                    Behavior in the Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology,
                    explains the goal of the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Experiments in which ants could be tracked with
                    particular accuracy during the last meters to the nest,
                    thanks to a grid painted on the floor, showed that the nest
                    hills are important visual cues. If they were removed, fewer
                    ants found their way back to the nest, while their nest
                    mates simultaneously began to rebuild nest mounds as quickly
                    as possible. If, on the other hand, the scientists placed
                    artificial landmarks in the form of small black cylinders
                    near the nest entrances whose mounds they had previously
                    removed, the ants did not invest in building new ones.
                    Apparently, the cylinders were sufficient for orientation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In ant nests, labor is divided. Ants that go foraging are
                    usually older and more experienced nest members, while
                    younger ants are busy building. Therefore, there must be
                    some kind of information flow between the two groups. The
                    researchers do not yet know exactly how this is achieved.
                    "One possibility would be that ants in the nest somehow
                    notice that fewer foragers return home, and as a result,
                    hill-building activities at the nest entrance are
                    increased," says Marilia Freire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Markus Knaden has been studying desert ants for 25 years and
                    is still amazed by their fascinating abilities: "The animals
                    can learn visual and olfactory cues despite their small
                    brains. In addition, they are able to decide which
                    information is useful for their navigation and which is not.
                    All this was already known. However, the fact that they even
                    build their own landmarks for orientation and only choose to
                    invest in this work when other environmental cues are
                    missing is quite surprising."

                    that after Pratt &amp; Whitney issued a recall on thousands
                    of engines on Airbus aircraft, major airlines like Spirit,
                    JetBlue, Hawaiian Airlines, and Wizz Air were forced to
                    change their schedules dramatically. The outlet says that
                    Wizz Air—a Hungarian airline that serves most of Europe—is
                    temporarily mulling over scrapping some flights while
                    dealing with maintenance issues as the engine recall
                    overworks staff. Spirit Airlines is facing a slump in
                    revenue with seven Airbuses in its fleet being grounded,
                    potentially through the end of the year, while cutting its
                    planned capacity by 5%

                    for its Geared Turbofan engines, which are used to power
                    A320neo Airbus jets. Pratt &amp; Whitney said that
                    contaminants were found in the metal used to build the
                    machines. The mishap is affecting around 1,200 engines
                    produced by the company and will require an inspection
                    period that could take as much as two months. The recall is
                    likely to have an impact on the remainder of the busy summer
                    travel season and—if Spirit’s estimates of being grounded
                    throughout the year are correct—could impact the holiday
                    travel window as well.

                    SARS-CoV-2 can also bind with other proteins, however. Was
                    it possible, the scientists wondered, that it could use
                    those other proteins to infiltrate cells? The answer was
                    yes. ACE-2 was the most efficient route, but it was not the
                    only route. And that suggests that the virus can bind and
                    infect even cells without any ACE-2 receptors at all.

                    That unexpected finding may help explain why coronaviruses
                    are so adept at species-hopping, Kasson says. And that makes
                    it even more important that scientists keep a close eye on
                    them, he notes.

                    learn how they spread and what to watch out for."

                    Researchers at HSE University in Perm have used
                    electroencephalography (EEG) to determine that consumers are
                    willing to pay 10% more for chocolate when they know it to
                    be a premium product. On the other hand, if consumers are
                    aware that a chocolate product is inexpensive, their
                    willingness to pay decreases by 13%. On average, men are
                    willing to pay 8.8 monetary units more for chocolate than
                    women, and men's willingness to pay decreases by 0.3
                    monetary units with each additional year of age. The study

                    The WTP (willingness to pay) indicator is used to assess
                    purchasing power, which represents the maximum amount that a
                    buyer is willing to pay for a product. Marketers use
                    surveys, focus groups and interviews to determine WTP, but
                    this approach can be expensive, time-consuming, and does not
                    always provide an accurate representation of respondents'
                    preferences.

                To improve productivity in the office MS-Office is getting a new
                UI ... or well it's getting a new default font and some new
                colours anyway. No more yellow! How this will improve
                productivity or make people write or calculate or power-point
                better is probably unclear, it's probably not even the purpose.
                This seems like change for the sake of change.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately they are making the default font a non-serif font
                again, but they are changing the name cause you can't have a
                font named "Beer Town" as the default font. Bring back Times New
                Roman!

                    A new study reports conclusive evidence for the breakdown of
                    standard gravity in the low acceleration limit from a
                    verifiable analysis of the orbital motions of long-period,
                    widely separated, binary stars, usually referred to as wide
                    binaries in astronomy and astrophysics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study carried out by Kyu-Hyun Chae, professor of physics
                    and astronomy at Sejong University in Seoul, used up to
                    26,500 wide binaries within 650 light years (LY) observed by
                    European Space Agency's Gaia space telescope. The study was
                    published in the 1 August 2023 issue of the Astrophysical
                    Journal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Chae explains, "From the start it seemed clear to me
                    that gravity could be most directly and efficiently tested
                    by calculating accelerations because gravitational field
                    itself is an acceleration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The study finds that when two stars orbit around with
                    each other with accelerations lower than about one nanometer
                    per second squared start to deviate from the prediction by
                    Newton's universal law of gravitation and Einstein's general
                    relativity.

              <p>
                What is intriguing is that this ... was suggested 40 years ago
                by theoretical physicist Mordehai Milgrom.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, what the wide binary data show are not only the breakdown
                of Newtonian dynamics but also the manifestation of the external
                field effect of modified gravity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike galactic rotation curves in which the observed boosted
                accelerations can, in principle, be attributed to dark matter in
                the Newton-Einstein standard gravity,
                <b
                  >wide binary dynamics cannot be affected by (Dark Matter) even
                  if it existed.</b
                >
                (Emphasis and changes are mine)
              </p>
              <p>
                Wide binary anomalies are a disaster to the standard gravity and
                cosmology that rely on dark matter and dark energy concepts.
                Because gravity follows MOND, a large amount of dark matter in
                galaxies (and even in the universe) are no longer needed. This
                is also a big surprise to Chae who, like typical scientists,
                "believed in" dark matter until a few years ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm not pushing MOND, just pushing back against Dark Matter.

                    The US broadband industry is united in opposition to a
                    requirement that Internet service providers list all of
                    their monthly fees. Five lobby groups representing cable
                    companies, fiber and DSL providers, and mobile operators
                    have repeatedly urged the Federal Communications Commission
                    to eliminate the requirement before new broadband labeling
                    rules take effect.

                    and in a meeting with FCC officials. The requirement that
                    ISPs list all their monthly fees "would add unnecessary
                    complexity and burdens to the label for consumers and
                    providers and could result in some providers having to
                    create many labels for any given plan," the groups said in
                    the filing on Friday.<br />[...]<br />Comcast submitted its
                    own filing urging the FCC to scrap the rules in June. The
                    calls to weaken the FCC's truth-in-billing rules angered
                    consumer advocates, as we

                    is already trying to create loopholes. This request would
                    allow the big ISPs to continue hiding the true cost of
                    service and frustrating customers with poor service," Joshua

                    provide identifying information to companies or the
                    government due to privacy concerns, fear of discrimination,
                    potential immigration status issues, mistrust of
                    institutions, and cultural preferences for privacy."

                  <p>
                    ISPs could avoid the requirement to collect identifying
                    information from consumers in retail stores by providing
                    hard copies of the label. The FCC defended the compliance

                    (CDL) service, which provides users with free access to a
                    digital library of books. US District Judge John Koeltl
                    decided that the IA infringed the copyright of four
                    publishers when it relaxed its CDL limitations during the
                    pandemic, but now the Archive has seemingly reached an
                    agreement with said publishers which could clear the way for
                    an appeal.

                    between the Archive and Hachette, HarperCollins, John Wiley
                    &amp; Sons, and Penguin Random House will require the IA to
                    pay an unspecified amount of money to the four publishers if
                    the appeal is unsuccessful. The publishing companies are
                    "extremely pleased" with the proposed injunction, as it
                    extends the copyright controversy to thousands of books
                    still in their catalogs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The IA was sued in 2020 after it started lending free
                    digital copies of its books during the pandemic, a practice
                    the Archive compared to book lending from traditional,
                    physical libraries. The CDL service was protected by the
                    fair use doctrine, the Archive argued, but Koeltl decided
                    otherwise. The Archive was lending free ebooks that were
                    being licensed to traditional libraries, the judge
                    determined.

                  <p>
                    If accepted, the consent judgment will provide the Archive a
                    chance to overturn Koeltl's unfavorable decision in the
                    appeal. The publishers defined the CDL service as a mass
                    copyright infringement operation, but the Archive
                    <a
                      href="https://blog.archive.org/2023/08/11/our-fight-is-far-from-over/"

                    >
                    that its fight is "far from over." The IA team firmly
                    believes that libraries should be able to "own, preserve,
                    and lend digital books" outside the limitations of temporary
                    licensed access (i.e., copyright).

                    [...] Current efforts to curb the strength and presence of
                    digital libraries – and the Internet Archive itself – are
                    cutting off the public's access to truth "at a key time in
                    our democracy," [Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle]
                    said. Strong libraries are paramount for a healthy
                    democracy, and that's why the IA is appealing Judge Koeltl's
                    decision.

                    Faculty and Girton College, came across the texts by
                    accident while researching in the National Library of
                    Scotland. He then had a "moment of epiphany" when he noticed
                    the scribe had written:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em
                      >'By me, Richard Heege, because I was at that feast and
                      did not have a drink.'</em
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It was an intriguing display of humour and it's rare for
                    medieval scribes to share that much of their character,"
                    Wade says. That made him investigate how, where and why
                    Heege had copied out the texts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This booklet contains three texts and Wade concludes
                    that around the year 1480 Heege copied them from a now lost
                    memory-aid written by an unknown minstrel performing near
                    the Derbyshire-Nottinghamshire border.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Most medieval poetry, song and storytelling has been
                    lost", Wade says. "Manuscripts often preserve relics of high
                    art. This is something else. It's mad and offensive, but
                    just as valuable."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Wade thinks the minstrel wrote part of his act down
                    because its many nonsense sequences would have been
                    extremely difficult to recall. "He didn't give himself the
                    kind of repetition or story trajectory which would have made
                    things simpler to remember," Wade says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The texts add to what we thought minstrels did.
                    Fictional depictions suggest they performed ballads about
                    Robin Hood, chivalric romances, adventure stories and songs
                    about great battles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These texts are far more comedic and they serve up
                    everything from the satirical, ironic, and nonsensical to
                    the topical, interactive and meta-comedic. It's a comedy
                    feast," Wade says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "People back then partied a lot more than we do today,
                    so minstrels had plenty of opportunities to perform. They
                    were really important figures in people's lives right across
                    the social hierarchy. These texts give us a snapshot of
                    medieval life being lived well."

                    Climate change will make stomach bugs an even bigger
                    problem, a new report has found. The study concludes that
                    expected changes in temperature, precipitation, and humidity
                    will make foodborne infections and toxins all the more
                    common—at least in Germany. That said, other research has
                    indicated that these increased risks will be seen globally
                    as well.

                    The research is part of a special series by scientists in

                    earlier this June in the
                    <em>Journal of Health Monitoring</em>. It’s a review of the
                    literature and focuses on common foodborne illnesses caused
                    by <em>Salmonella</em>,<em> Campylobacter</em>,and<em>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Across the board, the researchers found evidence that all
                    these infections and toxin poisonings will steadily increase
                    in the years to come due to climate change, though for many
                    varying reasons.

                    [...] Important as these warnings are, the authors of the
                    current report say that it’s well past time to start taking
                    action to mitigate these risks, both on a small and large
                    scale.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Our main recommendations for minimizing the health risk
                    from foodborne infections and intoxications lie in the area
                    of kitchen hygiene, which should always be applied when
                    preparing food,” the scientists wrote. “This includes
                    thorough handwashing and the use of fresh kitchen utensils
                    after handling raw meat and fish, as well as avoidance of
                    cross-contamination,” the authors wrote.

                  <p>
                    To which they added: “We also recommend the use of new
                    technologies to track supply chains. Given a globalized food
                    distribution network and the use of different processing and
                    preservation techniques, it can be difficult to track a
                    product’s supply chain to identify potential risks.”

                    Specifically, the analysis found that a “basket” of the most

                    from just a year ago. That’s more than the monthly cost for
                    the typical cable bundle, which is $83 a month, the
                    Financial Times reports.

                    the streaming gold rush is over, and rather than looking for
                    growth from the big streamers, Wall Street now wants to see

                    won’t be in any rush to go back to Big Cable. But if you’re
                    still looking to save money through cord-cutting, you’ll be

                hardware, news, science, security, politics and so on), and keep
                it on the frontpage for a week, would that work for you? If we'd

                    The Tesla, SpaceX and X (ugh) CEO has said in the past that
                    people having access to their flight data can pose a
                    security risk, but Axios asserts that the information has
                    proven to be very useful for journalists and other
                    researchers. This sort of tracking has always been part of
                    public record, but until online flight trackers started
                    taking off (I'm so sorry), it was sort of a pain in the ass
                    for most people to learn who

                  <p>
                    The outlet reports that a provision deep inside the
                    five-year FAA reauthorization bill would require the agency
                    to establish a process that would let jet owners request to
                    keep their planes' registration numbers and other
                    information private. That's lame as hell. The bill
                    reportedly passed the House by a 351-69 (nice) vote in July,
                    and now it must be reconciled with the Senate before
                    President Biden can sign it.

                    While water lilies are perhaps most famous for starring in
                    French impressionist artist Claude Monet's work, they may
                    also have a molecular secret weapon that could help in our
                    ongoing fight against fungal infections.

                  <p>
                    After viruses and bacteria, fungus is the most deadly
                    pathogen and, much like bacteria, is adapting fast to be
                    resistant to current medical interventions. While the
                    official numbers show that around 8,000 Americans die from
                    fungal infections each year, it's likely to be much higher,
                    since many cases go undiagnosed and, as an 'opportunistic
                    pathogen,' the microorganism can attack weakened immune
                    systems for complex comorbidities.

                    [...] However, there's some good news. Scientists out of the
                    University of Oklahoma (UO) may have found a molecule in a
                    species of water lily or lotus that can fight off fungal
                    infection.

                    A ragtag bunch of amateur hackers, many of them teenagers
                    with little technical training, have been so adept at
                    breaching large targets, including Microsoft, Okta, Nvidia,
                    and Globant, that the federal government is studying their

                    unsophisticated, have proved highly effective.<br />[...]<br />Rather

                    defeating MFA this way: "Call the employee 100 times at 1 am
                    while he is trying to sleep, and he will more than likely
                    accept it. Once the employee accepts the initial call, you
                    can access the MFA enrollment portal and enroll another

                    particles that became loose as the spacecraft vibrated
                    before and during launch, and that these thruster issues

                    The Intel 8086 microprocessor (1978) revolutionized
                    computing by founding the x86 architecture that continues to
                    this day. One of the lesser-known features of the 8086 is
                    the "hold" functionality, which allows an external device to
                    temporarily take control of the system's bus. This feature
                    was most important for supporting the 8087 math coprocessor
                    chip, which was an option on the IBM PC; the 8087 used the
                    bus hold so it could interact with the system without
                    conflicting with the 8086 processor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This blog post explains in detail how the bus hold feature
                    is implemented in the processor's logic. (Be warned that
                    this post is a detailed look at a somewhat obscure feature.)
                    I've also found some apparently undocumented characteristics
                    of the 8086's hold acknowledge circuitry, designed to make
                    signal transition faster on the shared control lines.

                    vulnerability that went unfixed for more than a month in
                    Microsoft Exchange was the cause of one of the UK's biggest
                    hacks ever—the breach of the country's Electoral Commission,

                    Although polyethylene was the plastic that inspired this
                    project, the upcycling method can also work on another type
                    of plastic known as polypropylene. These two materials make
                    up much of the plastic consumers encounter every daily, from
                    product packaging to food containers to fabrics. One of the
                    exciting features of Liu's new upcycling method is that it
                    can be used on both these plastics at once, meaning that
                    it's not necessary to separate the two from each other. This
                    is a major advantage over some recycling methods used today,
                    which require careful sorting of plastics to avoid
                    contamination. That sorting process can be quite difficult,
                    because of how similar the two plastics are to each other.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another benefit of the upcycling technique is that it has
                    very simple requirements: plastic and heat. Although the
                    later steps in the process require some additional
                    ingredients to convert the wax molecules into fatty acids
                    and soap, the initial transformation of the plastic is a
                    straightforward reaction. This contributes to the method's
                    cost-effectiveness as well as its comparatively small
                    environmental impact.

                    [...] "It should be realized that plastic pollution is a
                    global challenge rather than a problem of a few mainstream
                    countries. Compared to a sophisticated process and complex
                    catalyst or reagent, a simple process may be more accessible
                    to many other countries worldwide," Xu said. "I hope this
                    can be a good start for the war fighting plastic pollution."

                    Asus has released a new addition to its Tinker Board line of
                    Arm-based single-board computer (SBC) systems, giving
                    hobbyists and embedded developers another design option with
                    a plethora of ports.

                    – slightly smaller than a playing card – the latest Tinker
                    Board 3N series sports a larger 100 x 100mm (4 x 4in)
                    footprint described by Asus as NUC-sized.

                  <p>
                    Like earlier models, the Tinker Board 3N is based on a
                    system-on-chip (SoC) from Rockchip, in this case the RK3568
                    which features a quad-core Cortex-A55 CPU cluster plus a
                    Mali-G52 GPU, while the board itself supports 2GB, 4GB or
                    8GB of LPDDR4 or LPDDR4X memory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Speaking of operating systems, Asus claims support for
                    the Tinker Board 3N with Debian or Yocto Linux, plus
                    Android. It also claims to support firmware over the air
                    (FOTA) updates for both Android and Linux.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Asus says that Tinker Board 3N will be available in three
                    versions "to meet diverse project requirements," comprising
                    Tinker Board 3N PLUS, Tinker Board 3N and Tinker Board 3N
                    LITE, but offers no information on what the differences
                    between these models are.

                  <p>
                    [...] While most Tinker Boards are based on an Arm SoC, the

                    Russia's space agency successfully launched a robotic
                    spacecraft Thursday on a journey to the Moon, the country's
                    first lunar explorer since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 sample

                    The Luna 25 mission lifted off from the Vostochny
                    Cosmodrome, located in Russia's Far East, at 7:10 pm ET
                    (23:10 UTC). Heading east, a Soyuz-2.1b rocket propelled
                    Luna 25 through an overcast cloud deck and into the
                    stratosphere, then shed its four first-stage boosters about
                    two minutes into the flight. A core stage engine fired a few
                    minutes longer, and the Soyuz rocket jettisoned its payload
                    shroud.<br />[...]<br />Russia would like the Luna 25

                    Soviet-era mission that was Russia's last probe to land on
                    the Moon, returned lunar soil samples to Earth on a robotic
                    spacecraft in August 1976, nearly four years after NASA's
                    last Apollo landing with astronauts. That feat was not

                    many as an initiative to potentially rival the US-led
                    Artemis program. Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin
                    visited the Vostochny Cosmodrome, where Luna 25 launched on
                    Thursday, and vowed to "resume the lunar program" abandoned

                    The tantalising theory that a fifth force of nature could
                    exist has been given a boost thanks to unexpected wobbling

                    accelerator facility, which explored how subatomic particles
                    called muons – similar to electrons but about 200 times
                    heavier – move in a magnetic field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Patel says the muons behave a bit like a child's spinning
                    top, in rotating around the axis of the magnetic field.
                    However, as the muons move, they wobble. The frequency of
                    that wobble can be predicted by the standard model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the experimental results from FermiLab do not appear to
                    match those predictions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prof Jon Butterworth of University College London, who works
                    on the Atlas experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
                    at Cern, said: "The wobbles are due to the way the muon
                    interacts with a magnetic field. They can be calculated very
                    precisely in the standard model but that calculation
                    involves quantum loops, with known particles appearing in
                    those loops.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If the measurements don't line up with the prediction, that
                    could be a sign that there is some unknown particle
                    appearing in the loops – which could, for example, be the
                    carrier of a fifth force."

                    HP all-in-one printer owners, upset that their devices
                    wouldn't scan or fax when low on ink, were handed a partial
                    win in a northern California court this week after a judge
                    denied HP's motion to dismiss their suit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The plaintiffs argued in their amended class action
                    <a

                    [PDF] that HP withheld vital information by including
                    software in its all-in-one printer/scanner/fax machines that
                    disabled non-printing functions when out of ink and not
                    telling buyers that was the case.

                  <p>
                    "It is well-documented that ink is not required in order to
                    scan or to fax a document, and it is certainly possible to
                    manufacture an All-in-One printer that scans or faxes when
                    the device is out of ink," the plaintiffs argued in their
                    complaint. The amended complaint was filed in February this
                    year after US federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman dismissed
                    the suit on the grounds that it hadn't properly stated a
                    claim.

                  <p>
                    Armed with their amended complaint, lawyers for San
                    Francsican Gary Freund and Minneapolis resident Wayne McMath
                    have succeeded at not only making relevant claims, but also
                    surviving an attempt by HP to have the entire case dismissed
                    for a second time. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the amended complaint, Freund and McMath's lawyers argue
                    that HP's move to disable devices that were low on ink was
                    intentional, citing HP's own comments from a support forum
                    post in which an HP support agent told a user complaining of
                    similar issues that their "HP printer is designed in such a
                    way that with the empty cartridge or without the cartridge
                    [the] printer will not function." 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This isn't the first time HP has been taken to court
                    over claims it improperly locked printers down. In 2022 the
                    IT giant settled a European lawsuit for $1.35 million
                    alleging it used security chips and DRM-like software to
                    prevent any third-party cartridges from functioning in HP
                    printers. The US corporation has dealt with similar cases in
                    Australia and America, which were settled. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    HP hasn't responded to our questions about the latest
                    lawsuit.

                    Coral reefs, the deep sea or the treetops of the rainforests
                    are considered the main hotspots of biodiversity. However,
                    they all trail behind the soils. According to a new study,
                    soils are the most species-rich ecosystems worldwide. Their
                    importance for human nutrition is enormous, and the
                    proportion of soils worldwide that are considered degraded
                    or destroyed is growing steadily. A trio of researchers led
                    by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and
                    Landscape Research WSL has now made the first estimate of
                    global soil biodiversity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since the data on soil diversity is extremely
                    patchy—especially in the global South—the results of the
                    study show huge ranges in some cases. For bacteria, for
                    example, the mean value is 40% of species living in the
                    soil—but the range extends from 25% to 88%. The
                    uncertainties are also enormous for viruses, which are
                    mainly studied as human pathogens. Accordingly, the authors
                    are bracing themselves for some criticism of their methods
                    and conclusions. "Our work is a first but important attempt
                    to estimate what proportion of global biodiversity lives in
                    the soil," says Anthony.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The goal, he says, is to provide the basis for much-needed
                    decisions to protect soils and their creatures worldwide.
                    "Soils are under enormous pressure, whether from
                    agricultural intensification, climate change, invasive
                    species and much more," Anthony points out. "Our study shows
                    that the diversity in soils is great and correspondingly
                    important, so they should be given much more consideration
                    in conservation."

                    The much-anticipated vote, which followed roughly six hours
                    of public comment both for and against driverless taxis,
                    came amid clashes between the robotaxi companies and some
                    residents of the hilly city. San Francisco first responders,
                    city transportation leaders and local activists are among
                    those who shared concerns about the technology.

                    The California Public Utilities Commission regulates
                    self-driving cars in the state and voted 3-to-1 in favor of
                    Waymo and Cruise expanding their operations.

                    [...] Genevieve Shiroma, the dissenting commissioner in the
                    3-1 vote, recommended the commission delay the vote until
                    they received a "better understanding of the safety impacts"
                    of the vehicles.

                    A few weeks ago when Twitter was renamed to X, and we
                    learned that Elon Musk somehow thinks people are going to
                    use "x" as both a verb and noun, I recalled having once
                    stumbled upon this 1983 "On Language" column from the late
                    great William Safire:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        "The Federal bureaucracy has invented a new verb," says
                        Charles DeLaFuente of Kew Gardens, N.Y., who had just
                        sent in his 1040 income-tax return to the Internal
                        Revenue Service. He attached an addressed envelope that
                        he had received from the I.R.S.; in the upper left-hand
                        corner, where the return address of the taxpayer
                        belongs, is the heavy black outline of a box. Next to
                        the box are the words "X box if refund."
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        "Never mind the unanswered question, 'If refund what?',"
                        the irate taxpayer observed. "We all know they mean to x
                        the box if you have a refund coming. Maybe the ink they
                        saved on those instructions will pay for the next round
                        of tax cuts."
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Mr. DeLaFuente — his name means "of the fountain" — is
                        blowing his geyser for the wrong reason. The verb to x
                        is not new. In 1849, Edgar Allan Poe wrote in one of his
                        tales: "'I shell have to x this ere paragrab,' said he
                        to himself, as he read it over." In 1935, Jonas Bayer
                        carried that crossing-out metaphor into the mechanical
                        age in Startling Detective magazine: "An imported
                        hatchet man with a .45-caliber typewriter can x out the
                        dangerous canary." Merriam-Webster's first citation in
                        the one-letter verb's literal sense is from Henry
                        Cassidy's 1943 book "Moscow Dateline": "I x'd out the
                        word 'west' in the third question, changing it to
                        'east.'"

                    Intel's ARC series GPUs are interesting, in many senses of
                    the word. They offer the best implementation of Intel's
                    image reconstruction system, XeSS, similar to Nvidia's DLSS
                    and AMD's FSR. XeSS, like its counterparts, utilizes machine
                    learning to fill in the pixel gaps on anti-aliased objects
                    and scenes. The results are sometimes clear, sometimes a bit
                    fuzzy if you pay close attention. In our review of Intel's
                    A770 and A750 GPUs in late 2022, we noted that
                    cross-compatibility between all three systems could be in
                    the works.

                    That kind of easy-swap function is not the case when a game
                    is running on a customized version of the WINE
                    Windows-on-Linux, translating Direct3D graphics calls to
                    Vulkan and prodding to see whether it, too, can make use of
                    Intel's graphics boost. As noted by Phoronix, Intel
                    developers contributing to the open source Mesa graphics
                    project added the ability to hide an Intel GPU from the
                    Vulkan Linux driver.

                    Currently, Maya is being installed only in Defence Ministry
                    systems and not on computers connected to the networks of
                    the three Services. On this, the official said the three
                    Services had also vetted it and would adopt it on service
                    networks as well soon. The Navy had already cleared it and
                    the Army and the Air Force were currently evaluating it, the
                    official added.

                    Maya was developed by government development agencies within
                    six months, the official said. Maya would prevent malware
                    attacks and other cyberattacks which had seen a steep
                    increase, the official noted.

                However, the attacks in and of themselves are less of a problem
                than the fact that a large, and increasing, number of them are
                successful against that aging legacy desktop operating system.

                For India to pull this off successfully, they must study how
                their opponent has maneuvered over the years against GNU/Linux
                deployments and in particular look at case studies like Kerala,
                Munich, Lower Saxony, Vaasa, and Turku. India's opponent in this
                move has had many programmes, years ago one was
                <a href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/EDGI">EDGI</a>,
                and a long standing mandate that "under NO circumstances lose
                against Linux".

                    Amazon ships more than a million packages daily, but there's
                    at least one person in a million who frowns when she
                    encounters a smiling box placed on her doorstep.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Canadian woman, Anca Nitu, told CBC that over the past two
                    months, more than 50 packages have arrived at her home. Each
                    package contained a return slip and a pair of shoes from an
                    Amazon buyer located in North America who wrongly shipped
                    their rejected shoes to Nitu's address.<br />[...]<br />Amazon
                    said that typically the company advises any recipient of an
                    unwanted package to fill out a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G33XVXQPUV79Z2ZC"
                      >Report Unwanted Package</a
                    >
                    form. That Amazon page says to report any unsolicited
                    packages "immediately," confirming that "third-party sellers
                    are prohibited from sending unsolicited packages to
                    customers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Nitu, her worries won't necessarily end, even if the
                    packages ever do stop coming. She told CBC that she has no
                    idea whether the Amazon sellers that are using her
                    information to ship unwanted return items are doing anything
                    else with her information. She also worries that if Amazon
                    doesn't unlink her name from the seller accounts, she could
                    one day be charged Amazon seller fees.
