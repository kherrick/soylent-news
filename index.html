                    features on the way, but it also has a tool at its disposal
                    that's reportedly pretty good at catching all those
                    AI-generated fake articles you see on the internet nowadays.
                    The company has been sitting on it for nearly two years, and
                    all it would have to do is turn it on. All the same, the Sam
                    Altman-led company is still contemplating whether to release
                    it as doing so might anger OpenAI's biggest fans.

                    the company released in 2023, but something much more
                    accurate. OpenAI is hesitant to release this AI-detection
                    tool, according to a report from the
                    <a

                    on Sunday based on some anonymous sources from inside the
                    company. The program is effectively an AI watermarking
                    system that imprints AI-generated text with certain patterns
                    its tool can detect. Like other AI detectors, OpenAI's
                    system would score a document with a percentage of how
                    likely it was created with ChatGPT.

                    this tool exists in an update to a May blog post posted
                    Sunday. The program is reportedly 99.9% effective based on
                    internal documents, according to the WSJ. This would be far
                    better than the stated effectiveness of

                    developed over the past two years. The company claimed that
                    while it's good against local tamping, it can be
                    circumvented by translating it and retranslating with
                    something like Google Translate or rewording it using
                    another AI generator. OpenAi also said those wishing to
                    circumvent the tool could "insert a special character in
                    between every word and then deleting that character."

                  <p>
                    Internal proponents of the program say it will do a lot to
                    help teachers figure out when their students have handed in
                    AI-generated homework. The company reportedly sat on this
                    program for years over concerns that close to a third of its
                    user base wouldn't like it. In an email statement, an OpenAI
                    spokesperson said:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        "The text watermarking method we're developing is
                        technically promising, but has important risks we're
                        weighing while we research alternatives, including
                        susceptibility to circumvention by bad actors and the
                        potential to disproportionately impact groups like
                        non-English speakers. We believe the deliberate approach
                        we've taken is necessary given the complexities involved
                        and its likely impact on the broader ecosystem beyond
                        OpenAI."

                  <p>
                    The other problem for OpenAI is the concern that if it
                    releases its tool broadly enough, somebody could decipher
                    OpenAI's watermarking technique. There is also an issue that

                    On July 27, the former US president and Republican nominee
                    for the upcoming election, Donald Trump, headlined the
                    biggest Bitcoin conference of the year in Nashville. In his
                    speech, Trump claimed he will make the US the "crypto
                    capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the
                    world" if returned to the White House after November's

                    Bitcoin prices plummeted after former President Donald Trump
                    suggested that the cryptocurrency could be used to pay off
                    the country's $35 trillion national debt.

                    Bitcoin dropped 12 percent in the past 24 hours and ether
                    plunged by 21 percent in the same time period. The price of
                    bitcoin has been dropping since Friday, and briefly dropped
                    to below $50,000 on Monday. This was the first time it had
                    dropped below these levels since February.

                    In recent weeks Trump has been attempting to position
                    himself firmly as pro-crypto. Speaking at a bitcoin
                    conference in Nashville, Tennessee on July 27, the
                    Republican presidential candidate unveiled his plans to make
                    the U.S. the "crypto capital of the planet" if he is elected
                    for a second term.

                  <p>
                    He also spoke about the U.S. creating a "strategic national

                    Neuralink's brain chip has been implanted into a second
                    patient as part of early human trials, Elon Musk told
                    podcast host Lex Fridman on Saturday. The company hasn't
                    disclosed when the surgery took place or the name of the
                    recipient, according to Reuters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Musk said 400 of the electrodes on the second patient's
                    brain are working out of 1,024 implanted. "I don't want to
                    jinx it but it seems to have gone extremely well," he said.
                    "There's a lot of signal, a lot of electrodes. It's working
                    very well."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The device allows patients with spinal cord injuries to play
                    video games, use the internet and control electronic devices
                    using their thoughts alone. In May, the company announced
                    that it was "accepting applications for the second
                    participant" in trials following FDA approval.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The original Neuralink implant patient, Nolan Arbaugh,
                    described the surgery as "super easy." In a demo, the
                    company showed how Arbaugh was able to move a cursor around
                    the screen of a laptop, pause an on-screen music device and
                    play chess and Civilization VI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Arbaugh himself participated in the marathon podcast with
                    Musk and Fridman. He said that the device allows him to make
                    anything happen on a computer screen just by thinking it,
                    helping reduce his reliance on caregivers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, problems cropped up shortly after his surgery when
                    some of electrodes retracted from his brain. The issue was
                    partly rectified later on by modifying the algorithm to make
                    the implants more sensitive. Neuralink told the FDA that in
                    a second procedure, it would place the implant's threads
                    deeper into the patient's brain to prevent them from moving
                    as much as they did in Arbaugh's case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] the company said it had over 1,000 volunteers for its
                    second surgical trial. Musk said he expects Neuralink to
                    implant its chips in up to eight more patients by the end of
                    2024.

                reviews the history of Bell Labs (going back into the late
                1800s). It ends with a section that wonders if re-creating a
                research monster like Bell Labs (peak employment = 25,000
                people) is possible today...or even needed. A sample from the
                middle:

                    Though it had many successes in the first 25 years of its
                    life, the crowning achievement of Bell Labs research (and
                    its strategy of leveraging early-stage scientific research
                    to create new products) is undoubtedly its development of
                    the transistor, along with its various derivatives (the
                    MOSFET, the solar PV cell) and associated manufacturing
                    technologies (including crystal pulling, zone melting, and
                    diffusion furnaces). The transistor is a classic case of
                    Bell Labs' strategy: wide research freedom, circumscribed by
                    the requirement to produce things useful for the Bell
                    System. The telephone network required enormous amounts of
                    vacuum tubes [Bell Labs developed de Forest's tube into a
                    useful amplifier] and mechanical relays to act as switches,
                    but these were far from ideal components. ... Mervin Kelly,
                    physicist and head of the Bell Labs vacuum tube department
                    in the early 1930s (and later the president of Bell Labs),
                    dreamed of replacing them with solid-state components with
                    no moving parts. Advances in quantum mechanics, and novel
                    materials known as semiconductors, suggested that such
                    components might be possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bell Labs had studied semiconductors since the early 1930s;
                    Walter Brattain, who would eventually share the Nobel Prize
                    for inventing the transistor, was hired in 1929 and had
                    begun to study an early semiconductor device called the
                    copper oxide rectifier. A Depression hiring freeze stymied
                    more serious semiconductor efforts until 1936, when Mervin
                    Kelly (now Bell Labs' director of research) was finally able
                    to start building a more robust solid-state physics
                    department and hired physicist William Shockley (the second
                    of the three transistor inventors). While not giving
                    Shockley any specific research tasks (indeed, the entire
                    solid-state group had "unprecedented liberty to follow their
                    own research noses as long as their work dovetailed with
                    general company goals"), Kelly emphasized to Shockley the
                    potential value of a solid-state component to replace tubes
                    and mechanical relays.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The solid-state physicists continued their research over the
                    next several years, studying the behavior of semiconductors
                    and attempting to create a semiconductor amplifier. This
                    research was interrupted by the war but resumed in 1945, the
                    same year physicist John Bardeen was hired. Bardeen proved
                    to be the catalyst the solid-state group needed, and over
                    the next several years Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley made
                    progress in understanding semiconductor behavior. In
                    December 1947, they unveiled their semiconductor amplifier:
                    the transistor. By 1950, Western Electric was making 100
                    transistors a month for use in Bell System equipment. A few
                    years later, in 1954, another Bell Labs solid-state research
                    effort yielded the world's first silicon solar PV cell.

                    In 2022, Jake Brown...bought a used 2017 Volkswagen Passat
                    from a local dealership.<br />[..]<br />Brown had heard that
                    some Volkswagens were having trouble with connected features
                    for a reason that, because of Brown's telecommunications
                    background, felt familiar to him: AT&amp;T, which Volkswagen
                    worked with to provide connectivity to the automaker's
                    vehicles, had "sunsetted" its 3G service that year.<br />[...]<br />The
                    3G sunset left drivers of some Volkswagens, including a
                    handful of models built between 2014 and 2019, unable to
                    access Volkswagen's Car-Net service. Car-Net includes remote
                    start, but also automated service notifications, emergency
                    assistance, antitheft alerts, and remote automatic crash
                    notifications, among other network-enabled features.

                TFA goes on to say that several other manufacturers have the
                same problem--cars built with 3G connectivity have been timed
                out by the telcos--completely beyond control of the car
                manufacturer. A query by Wired to VW wasn't all that helpful--it
                seems there are already lawsuits about this and no solution in
                sight after several years since 3G stopped. They do mention that
                VW expect 4G (currently shipping in their cars) to last to 2035
                [but that may be wishful thinking--submitter].
              </p>
              <p>
                TFA also includes a discussion of expected service life of
                phones (a few years, updates for seven years) vs cars which
                average over 12 years (USA), with many at 20+.

                Your AC wonders why there isn't an option to ignore the built-in
                wireless modem and either: swap out the modem module, or connect
                the car (through USB or other cable) to a current phone [but
                this may have security problems?] Personally I'm not interested
                in any of these connected cars--and this is just another nail in
                the coffin for me.

                    Japanese researchers have discovered ice 0, a new type of
                    ice that forms near the surface of water, potentially
                    redefining scientific understanding and influencing
                    technology and climate studies. (Artist’s concept). Credit:

                  <p>
                    Ice is far more complex than most people realize, with
                    science identifying over 20 different varieties formed under
                    various combinations of pressure and temperature. The type
                    we use to chill our drinks, known as ice I, is one of the
                    few forms that occur naturally on Earth. Recently,
                    researchers from Japan discovered another type: ice 0, an
                    unusual form of ice that can initiate the formation of ice
                    crystals in supercooled water.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The formation of ice near the surface of liquid water can
                    start from tiny crystal precursors with a structure similar
                    to a rare type of ice, known as ice 0. In a study recently
                    published in <em>Nature Communications</em>, researchers
                    from the Social Cooperation Research Department “Frost
                    Protection Science,” at the
                    <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-tokyo/"
                      >Institute of Industrial Science, The University of
                      Tokyo</a
                    >
                    showed that these ice 0-like structures can cause a water
                    droplet to freeze near its surface rather than at its core.
                    This discovery resolves a longstanding puzzle and could help
                    redefine our understanding of how ice forms.

                  <p>
                    Crystallization of ice, known as ice nucleation, usually
                    happens heterogeneously, or in other words, at a solid
                    surface. This is normally expected to happen at the surface
                    of the water’s container, where liquid meets solid. However,
                    this new research shows that ice crystallization can also
                    occur just below the water’s surface, where it meets the
                    air. Here, the ice nucleates around small precursors with
                    the same characteristic ring-shaped structure as ice 0.

                    To address the climate crisis effectively, immediate action
                    on methane emissions is essential. Methane has contributed
                    about half the global warming we’ve experienced so far, and
                    emissions are climbing rapidly. An international team of
                    climate researchers writing today (July 30) in
                    <em>Frontiers in Science</em> set out three imperatives to
                    cut methane emissions and share a new tool to help us find
                    the most cost-effective ways of doing so.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The world has been rightly focused on carbon dioxide, which
                    is the largest driver of climate change to date,” said
                    Professor Drew Shindell of Duke University, lead author.
                    “Methane seemed like something we could leave for later, but
                    the world has warmed very rapidly over the past couple of
                    decades, while we’ve failed to reduce our CO2 emissions. So
                    that leaves us more desperate for ways to reduce the rate of
                    warming rapidly, which methane can do.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Methane is the second most potent greenhouse gas, but only
                    about 2% of global climate finance goes towards cutting
                    methane emissions. These emissions are also rising fast, due
                    to a combination of emissions from fossil fuel production
                    and increased emissions from wetlands, driven by the climate
                    crisis. To slow the damage from climate change and make it
                    possible to keep global warming below 2°C, we need to act
                    immediately, following the Global Methane Pledge to reduce
                    methane emissions by 30% from their 2020 level by 2030.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Methane doesn’t accumulate in the atmosphere in the
                    long term, so emissions reductions take effect more quickly.
                    If we could cut all methane emissions tomorrow, in 30 years
                    more than 90% of accumulated methane—but only around 25% of
                    carbon dioxide—would have left the atmosphere.

                    The Space Shuttle contained a bulky printer so the
                    astronauts could receive procedures, mission plans, weather
                    reports, crew activity plans, and other documents. Needed
                    for the first Shuttle launch in 1981, this printer was
                    designed in just 7 months, built around an Army
                    communications terminal. Unlike modern printers, the
                    Shuttle's printer contains a spinning metal drum with raised
                    characters, allowing it to rapidly print a line at a time.

                    This printer is known as the Space Shuttle Interim
                    Teleprinter System.1 As the name "Interim" suggests, this
                    printer was intended as a stop-gap measure, operating for a
                    few flights until a better printer was operational. However,
                    the teleprinter proved to be more reliable than its
                    replacement, so it remained in use as a backup for over 50
                    flights, often printing thousands of lines per flight. This
                    didn't come cheap: with a Shuttle flight costing $27,000 per
                    pound, putting the 59-pound teleprinter in space cost over
                    $1.5 million per flight.

                    In copper-containing materials called cuprates,
                    superconductivity competes with two properties called
                    magnetic spin and electric charge density wave (CDW) order.
                    These properties reveal different parts of the electrons in
                    the superconductor. Each electron possesses spin and charge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a regular metal, the spins cancel each other out and
                    electrical charges are uniform across a material. However,
                    the strong electron–electron interactions in
                    high-temperature superconductors such as cuprates give rise
                    to other possible states.

                    in <i>Nature Communications</i> has examined materials where
                    strong magnetic interaction causes some of the electron
                    spins to order along stripes. This occurs when spin density
                    waves (SDW) and CDWs lock together to form a stable
                    long-range "stripe state" where the peaks and valleys of the
                    two waves are aligned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This state reinforces the stability of the SDW and CDW. This
                    stripe state competes with and interrupts the
                    superconducting phase. Now, however, researchers have found
                    that short-range CDW can be compatible, rather than
                    competitive, with superconductivity in cuprate materials.
                    This finding runs counter to scientific conventional wisdom.

                  <p>
                    [...] The research also identified the possibility that
                    short-range charge order may enable the formation and motion
                    of vortices in the superconducting phase. This means
                    researchers may be able to stabilize superconductivity at
                    higher temperatures and magnetic fields by controlling or
                    enhancing short-range charge order.

                  <p>
                    In an era when anyone can create artificial intelligence
                    (AI) images, the ability to detect fake pictures,
                    particularly deepfakes of people, is becoming increasingly
                    important. Now, scientists say the eyes may be the key to
                    distinguishing deepfakes from real images.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    New research presented at the Royal Astronomical Society's
                    National Astronomy Meeting indicates that deepfakes can be
                    identified by analyzing the reflections in human eyes,
                    similar to how astronomers study pictures of galaxies. The
                    study, led by University of Hull MSc student Adejumoke
                    Owolabi, focuses on the consistency of light reflections in
                    each eyeball. Discrepancies in these reflections often
                    indicate a fake image.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The reflections in the eyeballs are consistent for the real
                    person, but incorrect (from a physics point of view) for the
                    fake person," said Kevin Pimbblet, professor of astrophysics
                    and director of the Centre of Excellence for Data Science,
                    Artificial Intelligence and Modelling at the University of
                    Hull.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers analyzed reflections of light on the eyeballs of
                    people in real and AI-generated images. They then employed
                    methods typically used in astronomy to quantify the
                    reflections and checked for consistency between left and
                    right eyeball reflections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fake images often lack consistency in the reflections
                    between each eye, whereas real images generally show the
                    same reflections in both eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To measure the shapes of galaxies, we analyze whether
                    they're centrally compact, whether they're symmetric, and
                    how smooth they are. We analyze the light distribution,"
                    said Pimbblet. "We detect the reflections in an automated
                    way and run their morphological features through the CAS
                    [concentration, asymmetry, smoothness] and Gini indices to
                    compare similarity between left and right eyeballs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The findings show that deepfakes have some differences
                    between the pair."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Gini coefficient is normally used to measure how the
                    light in an image of a galaxy is distributed among its
                    pixels. This measurement is made by ordering the pixels that
                    make up the image of a galaxy in ascending order by flux and
                    then comparing the result to what would be expected from a
                    perfectly even flux distribution. A Gini value of 0 is a
                    galaxy in which the light is evenly distributed across all
                    of the image's pixels, while a Gini value of 1 is a galaxy
                    with all light concentrated in a single pixel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team also tested CAS parameters, a tool originally
                    developed by astronomers to measure the light distribution
                    of galaxies to determine their morphology, but found it was
                    not a successful predictor of fake eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's important to note that this is not a silver bullet for
                    detecting fake images," Pimbblet added. "There are false
                    positives and false negatives; it's not going to get
                    everything. But this method provides us with a basis, a plan
                    of attack, in the arms race to detect deepfakes."

                    When giant solar storms hit Earth, they trigger beautiful
                    auroral displays high in Earth's atmosphere. There's a dark
                    side to this solar activity, though. The "space weather" it
                    sets off also threatens our technology. The potential for
                    damage is why we need highly accurate predictions of just
                    when these storms will impact our planet's magnetosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To figure that out, scientists in England went to the
                    source: specific places on the sun where these storms erupt.
                    Those outbursts are called coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
                    They're huge explosions of magnetically charged particles
                    and gases from the sun. They travel through space and hit
                    whatever is in their way, including planets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When that cloud of charged particles hits our magnetic
                    field, it sets off a chain reaction of events. Of course, it
                    creates beautiful auroral displays—northern and southern
                    lights that dance in the skies. But, they also slam into and
                    can damage orbiting satellites, including all our
                    telecommunications and navigation systems for planes, boats,
                    and trains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team found a very strong relationship between the
                    critical height of the CME as it gets started and its true
                    speed as it moves out. "This insight allows us to predict
                    the CME's speed and, consequently, its arrival time on
                    Earth, even before the CME has fully erupted," Ghandhi said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Knowing the actual speed of the CME to a higher degree of
                    accuracy will let solar physicists predict when it will hit
                    Earth. That, in turn, will allow satellite operators, grid
                    owners, space agencies, and others to prepare for the action
                    and protect their assets.

                Scientist suggest building a biorepository on the moon, like a
                extra terrestrial Svalbard Global Seed Vault. If/when earth
                collapses how are the survivors going to make it to the moon to
                kickstart things? Or are we expecting benevolent xenomorphs to
                bring us back to life?

                    Researchers propose a lunar biorepository to protect Earth's
                    endangered species by utilizing the Moon's cold temperatures
                    for long-term storage of biological samples. This initiative
                    seeks to overcome Earth's natural and political risks by
                    fostering global collaboration and developing new
                    technologies for space transport and sample preservation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Faced with the threat of extinction for numerous species, an
                    international team of researchers has suggested a
                    groundbreaking solution to safeguard the planet's
                    biodiversity: a lunar biorepository. As outlined in a recent
                    article in the journal <em>BioScience</em>, this plan
                    involves establishing a passive, enduring storage facility
                    on the moon for cryopreserved samples of Earth's most
                    endangered animal species.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Led by Dr. Mary Hagedorn of the Smithsonian's National Zoo
                    and Conservation Biology Institute, the team envisions
                    taking advantage of the Moon's naturally cold temperatures,
                    particularly in permanently shadowed regions near the poles,
                    where temperatures remain consistently below –196 degrees
                    Celsius. Such conditions are ideal for long-term storage of
                    biological samples without the need for human intervention
                    or power supplies, two factors that could threaten the
                    resilience of Earth-based repositories. Other key advantages
                    of a lunar facility include protection from Earth-based
                    natural disasters, climate change, and geopolitical
                    conflicts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An initial focus in the development of a lunar biorepository
                    would be on cryopreserving animal skin samples with
                    fibroblast cells. The author team has already begun
                    developing protocols using the Starry Goby (<em
                      >Asterropteryx semipunctata</em
                    >) as an exemplar species, with other species to follow. The
                    authors also plan to "leverage the continental-scale
                    sampling that is currently underway at the U S National
                    Science Foundation's National 190 Ecological Observatory
                    Network (NEON)" as a source for future fibroblast cell
                    development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Challenges to be addressed include developing robust
                    packaging for space transport, mitigating radiation effects,
                    and establishing the complex international governance
                    frameworks for the repository. The authors call for broad
                    collaboration among nations, agencies, and international
                    stakeholders to realize this decades-long program. The next
                    steps include expanding partnerships, particularly with
                    space research agencies, and conducting further testing on
                    Earth and aboard the International Space Station.

                  <p>
                    Despite the challenges to be overcome, the authors highlight
                    that the need for action is acute: "Because of myriad
                    anthropogenic drivers, a high proportion of species and
                    ecosystems face destabilization and extinction threats that
                    are accelerating faster than our ability to save these
                    species in their natural environment."

                    optical communications, which use infrared light signals
                    instead of the more conventional radio waves to transmit
                    data. As part of these efforts, it recently conducted a
                    series of flight tests that involved installing a laser
                    terminal on the belly of a Pilatus PC-12 aircraft. This
                    single-engine plane then proceeded to beam 4K video while
                    soaring over Lake Erie to a ground station in Cleveland,
                    Ohio.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From there, the video signal went on an epic journey,
                    passing through NASA's White Sands facility in New Mexico
                    before being fired off into space 22,000 miles away using
                    infrared lasers towards an experimental satellite called the
                    Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD). The LCRD
                    then relayed the data to a special terminal aboard the ISS
                    called ILLUMA-T, which beamed it back to Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite this incredibly long distance, NASA says the laser
                    link achieved transmission rates of over 900 Mbps. To put
                    that into perspective, the average household internet in the
                    US churns out 245 Mbps as of June 2024.

                    For many years, insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor

                    controlling mosquitoes that spread malaria, a serious global
                    health threat. These strategies have also, incidentally,
                    helped to reduce populations of other unwanted household
                    pests such as bed bugs, cockroaches, and flies.

                    study reviewing the academic literature on indoor pest
                    control shows that as the household insects developed
                    resistance to the insecticides targeting mosquitoes, the
                    return of these bed bugs, cockroaches and flies into homes
                    has led to community distrust and often abandonment of these

                    malaria – are increasingly viewed as the causes of household
                    pest resurgence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “These insecticide-treated bed nets were not intended to
                    kill household pests like bed bugs, but they were really
                    good at it,” said Chris Hayes, an NC State Ph.D. student and
                    co-corresponding author of a paper describing the work.
                    “It’s what people really liked, but the insecticides are not
                    working as effectively on household pests anymore.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Non-target effects are usually harmful, but in this case
                    they were beneficial,” said Coby Schal, Blanton J. Whitmire
                    Distinguished Professor of Entomology at NC State and
                    co-corresponding author of the paper.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The value to people wasn’t necessarily in reducing malaria,
                    but was in killing other pests,” Hayes added. “There’s
                    probably a link between the use of these nets and widespread
                    insecticide resistance in these house pests, at least in
                    Africa.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers say that all hope is not lost, though.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “There are, ideally, two routes,” Schal said. “One would be
                    a two-pronged approach with both mosquito treatment and a
                    separate urban pest management treatment that targets pests.
                    The other would be the discovery of new malaria-control
                    tools that also target these household pests at the same
                    time. For example, the bottom portion of a bed net could be
                    a different chemistry that targets cockroaches and bed bugs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “If you offer something in bed nets that suppresses pests,
                    you might reduce the vilification of bed nets.”

                    [...] China’s manufacturing dominance has resulted in a
                    domestic workforce with the experience to achieve process
                    innovations and product improvements that have no equal in
                    the West.  And it has come with the sophisticated supply
                    chains that support a wide range of today’s technological
                    capabilities and serve as the foundations for the next
                    generation. None of that was inevitable. For example, most
                    drone electronics are integrated on printed circuit boards
                    (PCBs), a technology that was

                    [...] China’s dominance in LiPo batteries for drones
                    reflects its overall dominance in Li-ion manufacturing.
                    China controls approximately 75% of global lithium-ion
                    capacity—the anode, cathode, electrolyte, and separator
                    subcomponents as well as the assembly into a single unit. It

                    [...] While the absence of the high-tech industrial capacity
                    needed for economic security is easy to label, it is not
                    simple to address. Doing so requires several interrelated
                    elements, among them designing and incentivizing appropriate
                    capital investments, creating and matching demand for a
                    talented technology workforce, building robust industrial
                    infrastructure, ensuring visibility into supply chains, and
                    providing favorable financial and regulatory environments
                    for on- and friend-shoring of production. This is a project
                    that cannot be done by the public or the private sector
                    alone. Nor is the US likely to accomplish it absent
                    carefully crafted shared partnerships with allies and
                    partners across both the Atlantic and the Pacific.

                    The opportunity to support today’s drones may have passed,
                    but we do have the chance to build a strong industrial base
                    to support tomorrow’s most critical technologies—not simply
                    the eye-catching finished assemblies of autonomous vehicles,
                    satellites, or robots but also their essential components.
                    This will require attention to our manufacturing
                    capabilities, our supply chains, and the materials that are
                    the essential inputs. Alongside a shift in emphasis to our
                    own domestic industrial base must come a willingness to plan
                    and partner more effectively with allies and partners.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If we do so, we will transform decades of US and allied
                    support for foundational science and technology into
                    tomorrow’s industrial base vital for economic prosperity and
                    national security. But to truly take advantage of this
                    opportunity, we need to value and support our shared,
                    long-term economic security. And this means rewarding
                    patient investment in projects that take a decade or more,
                    incentivizing high-capital industrial activity, and
                    maintaining a determined focus on education and workforce
                    development—all within a flexible regulatory framework.

                Several decades ago, a torn UCL was generally a career ending
                injury. In 1974, Dodgers' pitcher
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_John"
                  >Tommy John</a
                >
                was the first baseball player to undergo a

                  >UCL reconstruction</a
                >, which involves grafting a tendon in place of the UCL, taking
                the tendon from elsewhere in the body or a donor. The procedure
                has become known as "Tommy John surgery" and has a high success
                rate, though with a long recovery time. However, continuing to
                pitch with high velocity and spin rates has led to the injury
                recurring a few years later and requiring a second surgery.
                There is also evidence that

                pitcher can rest between pitches. Although the pitch clock
                improves the pace of games, it has

              <p>
                The obvious question is why pitchers would be willing to throw
                pitches at high velocities and spin rates knowing that the
                result is likely Tommy John surgery. The answer is that there
                are only so many spots on a major league roster available, and
                if one pitcher isn't willing to assume that risk, someone else
                will. The best starting pitchers get massive contracts that pay
                tens of millions of dollars per year, so there's a lot of money
                potentially available for those willing to accept the high risk
                of injuries. Even at lower levels, pitchers know that if they
                want to be successful, they need to be able to throw the ball
                hard. There has even been

                Fortunately, the same data that allows us to link pitch velocity
                and spin rate with effectiveness may also offer a solution to
                reduce injuries. Tracking pitch velocity and spin rate can allow
                us to determine how frequently pitchers are throwing pitches
                that contribute most to UCL injuries. One proposal is to
                <a
                  href="https://blogs.fangraphs.com/a-high-velocity-usage-tax-a-proposal-to-protect-pitchers/"
                  >track the number of high risk pitches thrown by each pitcher
                  and imposing a cap on a pitcher's innings in a season</a
                >, progressively lowering that cap for pitchers who throw more
                high risk pitches. Part of a pitcher's value to a team is their
                availability. If a pitcher is unavailable because they've
                reached their innings cap, they're less valuable to a team,
                providing an incentive to reduce the number of pitches thrown at
                high velocity and perhaps high spin rates. The proposed rule in
                the linked article focuses on fastballs, but a similar strategy
                could be applied to other high risk pitches.

                    Many commentators have questioned why an organization would
                    join their ESXi hosts to AD in the first place, despite it
                    being a relatively common practice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Why are ESX servers joined with an active directory in the
                    first place? Because it is convenient to manage admin access
                    to servers using a centralized platform in large
                    corporations," Dr Martin J Kraemer, security awareness
                    advocate at KnowBe4, told <em>The Register</em>. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is very common but also creates challenges. In many
                    environments, the AD itself might run on a VM. Cold boot can
                    be a nightmare. A chicken and egg problem. How can you start
                    ESX without AD while AD runs on ESX? Admins must think about
                    this. A well-known challenge.

                    [...] "Over the last year, we have seen ransomware actors
                    targeting ESXi hypervisors to facilitate mass encryption
                    impact in few clicks, demonstrating that ransomware
                    operators are constantly innovating their attack techniques
                    to increase impact on the organizations they target," it
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft also said that ESXi hypervisors often fly further
                    under the radar in security operations centers (SOCs)
                    because security solutions often don't have the necessary
                    visibility into ESXi, potentially allowing attackers to go
                    undetected for longer periods of time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because of the destruction a successful ESXi attack could
                    cause, attacks have risen sharply. In the past three years,
                    the targeting of ESXi hypervisors has doubled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Microsoft recommends that all ESXi users install the
                    available patches and scrub up their credential hygiene to
                    prevent future attacks, as well as use a robust
                    vulnerability scanner, if you don't already.

                From ScienceBlog: A comprehensive analysis of 24
                state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) has uncovered a
                significant left-of-center bias in their responses to
                politically charged questions. The study, published in PLOS ONE,
                sheds light on the potential political leanings embedded within
                AI systems that are increasingly shaping our digital landscape.
              </p>
              <p>
                The underlying paper at PLOS One:
                <a
                  href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306621"
                  >https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306621</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The researcher used a variety of tests of political alignment to
                assess the bias of some Large Language Models (LLMs) and found
                that they exhibited a left-of-center bias. To discover whether
                that bias can be affected by changing the training data,
                versions of LLMs were trained on selected sources, producing
                biases to order.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's a question for the community: Is the 'centerpoint' of
                political bias, as judged by these tests, arbitrary and
                reflective of the gamut of bias that is accepted as normal at
                this time? Is that centerpoint an absolute that can be used as a
                reference, or is it simply an artifact of how the political
                universe is currently understood? It seems to me that the phase
                space it exists in is limited by the kinds of political
                organizations which are preset in the world today, and that
                there might be valid solutions which have not yet been explored.

                    The IBM report suggests that severe staffing shortages are
                    linked to higher data breach costs – more than half of the
                    604 organisations studied had severe or high-level staffing
                    shortages last year.

                    Businesses with high levels of staffing issues had an
                    average data breach cost of €5.28m, compared to €3.66m for
                    businesses with lower levels. This trend may be reduced in
                    the near future, as more organisations said they are
                    planning to increase security budgets compared to last year.

                    An international team of scientists, including two
                    researchers who now work in the Center for Advanced Sensor
                    Technology (CAST) at UMBC, has shown that twisted carbon
                    nanotubes can store three times more energy per unit mass
                    than advanced lithium-ion batteries. The finding may advance

                    [...] The researchers studied single-walled carbon
                    nanotubes, which are like straws made from pure carbon
                    sheets only 1-atom thick. Carbon nanotubes are lightweight,
                    relatively easy to manufacture, and about 100 times stronger
                    than steel. Their amazing properties have led scientists to

                  <p>
                    To investigate carbon nanotubes' potential for storing
                    energy, the UMBC researchers and their colleagues
                    manufactured carbon nanotube "ropes" from bundles of
                    commercially available nanotubes. After pulling and twisting
                    the tubes into a single thread, the researchers then coated
                    them with different substances intended to increase the
                    ropes' strength and flexibility.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team tested how much energy the ropes could store by
                    twisting them up and measuring the energy that was released
                    as the ropes unwound. They found that the best-performing
                    ropes could store 15,000 times more energy per unit mass
                    than steel springs, and about three times more energy than
                    lithium-ion batteries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The stored energy remains consistent and accessible at
                    temperatures ranging from -76 to +212 °F (-60 to +100 °C).
                    The materials in the carbon nanotube ropes are also safer
                    for the human body than those used in batteries.

                    "Humans have long stored energy in mechanical coil springs
                    to power devices such as watches and toys," Kumar Ujjain
                    says. "This research shows twisted carbon nanotubes have

                    excited to share the news with the world."

                    Reddit CEO Steve Huffman is standing by Reddit's decision to
                    block companies from scraping the site without an AI
                    agreement.
                  </p>

                    Last week, 404 Media noticed that search engines that

                    today, Huffman stood by the changes that led to Google
                    temporarily being the only search engine able to show recent
                    discussions from Reddit. Reddit and Google signed an

                    "[It's been] a real pain in the ass to block these
                    companies," Huffman told The Verge.<br />[...]<br />A
                    Microsoft spokesperson told me last week that "Microsoft
                    respects the robots.txt standard and we honor the directions
                    provided by websites that do not want content on their pages
                    to be used with our generative AI models."<br />[...]<br />Huffman
                    also reportedly made reference to a June

                      >CNBC interview</a
                    >
                    where Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, said: "I think
                    that with respect to content that is already on the open
                    web, the social contract of that content since the '90s has
                    been that it is fair use. Anyone can copy it, re-create with
                    it, reproduce with it. That has been freeware, if you like.
                    That's been the understanding." Suleyman added that his
                    comment didn't refer to certain types of web content, like
                    news organizations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We've had Microsoft, Anthropic, and Perplexity act as
                    though all of the content on the internet is free for them
                    to use. That's their real position," Huffman said.

                abuse of United States copyright law, as the site in question is
                undoubtably covered by fair use in United States copyright law.
                Editor: See first link for more detail.

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    It is unfortunately well known that the DMCA is used by
                    corporate cyberbullies to take down content that they
                    disagree with; but, is otherwise legal. The Counternotice
                    system is also hillariously ineffective. The DMCA requires
                    service providers to "act expeditiously to remove or disable
                    access to the infringing material;" yet, it gives those same
                    "service providers" 14 days to restore access in the event
                    of a counternotice! The DMCA, like much American
                    legislation, is heavily biased towards corporations, instead
                    of the actual, living, breathing, citizens of the country.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's absolutely asinine and I would love absolutely nothing
                    more than to have a lawsuit "win" against CrowdStrike. That
                    would be absolutely amazing for marketing! Especially given
                    the timing of such events...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, using the Digital Millenium Copyright Act to
                    attempt to takedown a parody site for Trademark Infringement
                    is absolutely hillarious.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are several ways that anyone is allowed to use a
                    trademark belonging to "others." This is considered "Fair
                    Use." Fair Use is an important aspect of trademark and
                    copyright law. It is a right to use trademarks and
                    copyrighted works for parody, criticism, transformative
                    works, news reporting / journalism, education, etc.
                    Corporate cyberbullies don't like that anyone else has
                    rights. Again, I don't care, because the only thing that
                    matters is the law, and what a court thinks about it.

                    The authors also predict that the expansion of the boundary
                    conditions has its consequences: a new kind of quantum
                    entanglement appears in the theory, mixing past and future,
                    which is not present in conventional particle theory. The
                    paper also raises the question of whether tachyons described
                    in this way are purely a ‘mathematical possibility’ or
                    whether such particles are likely to be observed one day.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the authors, tachyons are not only a
                    possibility but are, in fact, an indispensable component of
                    the spontaneous breaking process responsible for the
                    formation of matter. This hypothesis would mean that Higgs
                    field excitations, before the symmetry was spontaneously
                    broken, could travel at superluminal speeds in the vacuum.

                    The AI Act won’t be felt until six months, when prohibitions
                    will apply against unacceptable-risk AI applications. The
                    rules for general-purpose AI models will apply one year from
                    now, while the majority of rules of the AI Act will start
                    applying on 2 August 2026.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, EU member states have until 2 August 2025 to
                    designate “national competent authorities”, which will
                    oversee the application of the AI Act and carry out market
                    surveillance activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With AI making its way into so many use cases, it will be
                    important for businesses of all sizes to consider the type
                    of AI systems they are using and where they fall into the AI
                    Act’s risk tiers. Phil Burr, head of product at Lumai, said
                    the biggest risk businesses face is ignoring the Act.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The good news is that the Act takes a risk-based approach
                    and, given that the vast majority of AI will be minimal or
                    low-risk, the requirements on businesses using AI will be
                    relatively small,” Burr said. “It’s likely to be far less
                    than the effort required to implement the GDPR regulations,
                    for example.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The biggest problem for compliance is the need to document
                    and then perform regular assessments to ensure that the AI
                    risks – and therefore requirements – haven’t changed. For
                    the majority of businesses there won’t be a change in risk,
                    but business at least need to remember to perform these.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While businesses have plenty of time to prepare, the road
                    ahead is not clear for them. Forrester principal analyst
                    Enza Iannopollo noted that firms don’t have any pre-existing
                    experience of complying with these type of rules, which adds
                    “complexity to the challenge”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Right now, it’s crucial that organisations ensure they
                    understand what theirs and their providers’ obligations are
                    in order to be compliant on time,” Iannopollo said. “This is
                    the time for organisations to map their AI projects,
                    classify their AI systems and risk assess their use-cases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “They also need to execute a compliance roadmap that is
                    specific to the amount and combination of use-cases they
                    have. Once this work is done, every company will have a
                    compliance roadmap that is unique to them.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To bridge the period between now and the full implementation
                    of the Act, the European Commission has launched the ‘AI
                    Pact’, which is initiative for AI developers to voluntarily
                    adopt key obligations of the Act ahead of its legal
                    deadlines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The EU has been introducing stronger penalties for breaches
                    in its more recent legislation, with the Digital Markets Act
                    and Digital Services Act carrying heavy fines for
                    non-compliance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The AI Act is no exception to this approach, as companies
                    that breach the Act could face fines of up to 7pc of their
                    global annual turnover for violations of banned AI
                    applications. They will also face fines of up to 3pc for
                    violations of other obligations and up to 1.5pc for
                    supplying incorrect information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “For reference, GDPR caps maximum fines to 4pc of
                    annual turnover, whereas EU competition law caps this at
                    10pc,” Koskinen said. “This comparison shows a clear
                    movement in regulatory enforcement for the AI Act, as the
                    maximum fines inch closer to those imposed on
                    anticompetitive behaviour.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “As businesses around the world look to Europe, the AI Act’s
                    requirements will lead the way in responsible AI innovation
                    and governance, while ensuring organisations are prepared
                    for its rapidly approaching enforcement.”

                Just to give you advance notice that the continual problem with
                the renewal of SSL certificates is due to occur on Monday 5 Aug.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nobody in the new team has the necessary access nor knowledge of
                the current hardware configuration, and control remains with
                NCommander. The transfer of assets has been initiated but as one
                of the two members of the current Board is out of the country
                everything has temporarily ground to a halt. We cannot
                reconfigure the existing structure as legally we do not yet
                'own' the database or existing hardware assets.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have requested that NCommander assist by renewing the
                certificates but that depends upon his availability. He has been
                kind enough to help in the past. There is nothing more I can do
                at the moment.
              </p>
              <p>
                I know that this is easily fixed - but until the formal exchange
                of the assets takes place we are on very shaky ground with
                regards to liabilities and responsibilities.

                    The Cheshire ATT facility is an underground complex
                    originally built in 1966. It was an underground terminal and
                    repeater station for the hardened analog L4 carrier cable
                    (coax) that went from Miami to New England carrying general
                    toll circuits and critical military communication circuits.
                    It reportedly housed an AUTOVON 4-wire switch as part of the
                    switching fabric of that critical global military
                    communications network. Cheshire also connected via
                    terrestrial microwave to the major, semi-hardened AT&amp;T
                    Durham station which linked to many other sites including
                    paths to New London (Navy Sub base) and to Green Hill, RI to
                    meet a transatlantic cable to Europe.

                    Amazon failed to adequately alert more than 300,000
                    customers to serious risks—including death and
                    electrocution—that US Consumer Product Safety Commission
                    (CPSC) testing found with more than 400,000 products that
                    third parties sold on its platform.<br />[...]<br />Instead
                    of recalling the products, which were sold between 2018 and
                    2021, Amazon sent messages to customers that the CPSC said
                    "downplayed the severity" of hazards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In these messages—"despite conclusive testing that the
                    products were hazardous" by the CPSC—Amazon only warned
                    customers that the products "may fail" to meet federal
                    safety standards and only "potentially" posed risks of "burn
                    injuries to children," "electric shock," or "exposure to
                    potentially dangerous levels of carbon monoxide."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Typically, a distributor would be required to specifically
                    use the word "recall" in the subject line of these kinds of
                    messages, but Amazon dodged using that language entirely.<br />[...]<br />The
                    CPSC has additional concerns about Amazon's "insufficient"
                    remedies. It is particularly concerned that anyone who
                    received the products as a gift or bought them on the
                    secondary market likely was not informed of serious known
                    hazards. The CPSC found that Amazon resold faulty hair
                    dryers and carbon monoxide detectors, proving that secondary
                    markets for these products exist.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Amazon has made no direct attempt to reach consumers who
                    obtained the hazardous products as gifts, hand-me-downs,
                    donations, or on the secondary market," the CPSC said.<br />[...]<br />After
                    the CPSC's testing, Amazon stopped allowing these products
                    to be listed on its platform, but that and other remedies
                    were deemed insufficient. So, over the next two months, to
                    protect the public, Amazon must now make a plan to "provide
                    notice of the product hazards to purchasers and the public"
                    and "incentivize the removal of these hazardous products
                    from consumers' homes," the CPSC ordered.<br />[...]<br />To
                    make up for "significant deficiencies" in Amazon's initial
                    messaging, mandatory recall notices will likely include "a
                    description of the product (including a photograph), hazard,
                    injuries, deaths, action being taken, and remedy," provide
                    "relevant dates and number of units" sold, and specifically
                    use "the word 'recall' in the heading and text," the CPSC
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Amazon's spokesperson told Ars that "in the event of a
                    product recall in our store, we remove impacted products
                    promptly after receiving actionable information from
                    recalling agencies, and we continue to seek ways to innovate
                    on behalf of our customers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our recalls alerts service also ensures our customers are
                    notified of important product safety information fast, and
                    the recalls process is effective and efficient," Amazon's
                    spokesperson said.

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    In recent weeks, two refreshed car models have been
                    launched: Hyundai's Ioniq 5 and BYD's SEAL. Both models,
                    introduced in 2021 and 2022 respectively, are receiving
                    significant updates ahead of the typical five-year facelift
                    cycle. This global automotive industry standard generally
                    involves cosmetic upgrades to keep cars relevant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, these updates are more than just aesthetic. The
                    Hyundai Ioniq 5 now features a substantial battery upgrade,
                    increasing from 72.6 kWh to 84 kWh. This enhancement boosts
                    the top model's range from 480 km to over 550 km. Other
                    upgrades include new wheel designs and interior materials,
                    but the major improvements lie beneath the surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These updates reflect a broader trend among electric
                    vehicle (EV) manufacturers, who have announced major
                    enhancements to existing models. Unlike mid-life upgrades in
                    gasoline cars, which often focus on superficial enhancements
                    like sound systems and wheel designs, EV upgrades are core
                    technological improvements. This trend is driven by several
                    factors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Recent trends in the used EV market show that the
                    introduction of significantly upgraded models or superior
                    competing models can deter buyers unless substantial
                    discounts are offered. The new Ioniq 5's increased range and
                    the SEAL's faster charging capabilities could negatively
                    affect the resale value of older models.

                    involving ICTs is conceptually and practically harmful.
                    Recent efforts at the domestic level to broaden its
                    definition have led to the criminalization of legitimate
                    activities, such as online criticism, religious expression,
                    or LGBTQ support. In the proposed treaty, it encourages
                    expansive interpretations that could lead to human rights
                    abuses and transnational repression.
                    <b>Recommendation:</b> Restrict the definition to "core
                    cybercrimes" like technical attacks on computers, devices,
                    data, and communications systems. Exclude human
                    rights-protected activities from the scope of the treaty to
                    prevent misuse and ensure these rights are not unjustly
                    targeted due to equating cybercrime with any crime using
                    ICT.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Expansive Scope and Over-Criminalization Risks: </b> The
                    draft Convention's criminalization chapter dangerously
                    broadens its scope by including crimes like "grooming" and
                    CSAM, not just cybercrimes. Its CSAM definition risks
                    criminalizing consensual conduct between minors. Even worse,
                    a proposed Protocol could add two more Ad Hoc sessions to
                    discuss even more crimes, further expanding its broad scope.
                    <b> Recommendation</b> : Criminalization must be limited to
                    Articles 7 to 11. Narrow the scope of the CSAM article to
                    target only intentional, malicious actions, exclude from
                    criminalization consensual activity between minors, make
                    exemptions for self-generated content by minors mandatory,
                    ensure financing provisions target only those knowingly
                    involved in illegal activities, and exclude the public
                    interest use of such materials, such as evidence in crime
                    investigations, and scientific or artistic materials.

                    The Knight Institute, alongside the Reporters Committee for
                    Freedom of the Press (RCFP), filed an amicus brief in
                    support of Sultanov's objection to the initial warrantless
                    search of his device. They argued that, specifics of the
                    case aside, allowing warrantless searches of cellphones at
                    the border - which the Department of Justice has long held
                    extends 100 miles from the actual physical edge of the US -
                    were likely to not only infringe upon fundamental rights
                    guaranteed by the constitution, but would have a chilling
                    effect on the ability of journalists to protect their
                    sources. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Letting border agents freely rifle through journalists'
                    work product and communications whenever they cross the
                    border would pose an intolerable risk to press freedom,"
                    RCFP lawyer Grayson Clary said in a statement. "This
                    thorough opinion provides powerful guidance for other courts
                    grappling with this issue, and makes clear that the
                    Constitution would require a warrant before searching a
                    reporter's electronic devices."

                  <p>
                    This is not the first case to challenge CBP's sweeping
                    authority to seize and search devices at or near the US
                    border, and it probably won't be the last one either.

                    [...] Wilkens told us Morrison's decision was "thorough and
                    very well reasoned," and that he's confident it will hold up
                    to scrutiny if the government appeals that one, too.
                    Regardless, he believes the matter is ripe for a national
                    decision before the US Supreme Court, aka SCOTUS.

                    Funding for free and open source software (FOSS) initiatives
                    under the EU's Horizon program has mostly vanished from next
                    year's proposal, claim advocates who are worried for the

                    Pierre-Yves Gibello, CEO of open-source consortium OW2,
                    urged EU officials to re-evaluate the elimination of funding
                    for the Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative from its
                    draft of 2025 Horizon funding programs in a recently

                    essential as the US, China and Russia mobilize "huge public
                    and private resources" toward capturing the personal data of
                    consumers, which the EU's regulatory regime has decided
                    isn't going to fly in its territory.

                    FOSS software, Gibello argued, is key to protecting European
                    interests from the data-guzzling economy that's grown up
                    elsewhere, which is why he's perplexed at the decision not
                    to fund NGI.

                  <p>
                    "We find this transformation incomprehensible, moreover when
                    NGI has proven efficient and economical to support free
                    software as a whole, from the smallest to the most
                    established initiative," Gibello said.

                    "Contrary to common perception, technical innovations often
                    originate from European rather than North American
                    programming communities, and are mostly initiated by
                    small-scaled organizations," he added.

                    Horizon funding has been doled out multiple times since the
                    program began. NGI has received tens of millions of euros
                    over the past few years under Cluster 4 of the program,
                    which doles out cash for digital, industry and space

                    possibility of one day selling a mouse that customers can
                    use "forever." The executive said such a mouse isn't
                    "necessarily super far away" and will rely on software

                    product wouldn't be the first software-heavy,
                    three-figure-price computer mouse. Still, a price tag of
                    around $200 would limit the audience to professionals or
                    enthusiasts.<br />[...]<br />Alternatively, the price of the
                    mouse's hardware could be subsidized by subscription
                    payments.

                    In any case, pushing out software updates would require
                    Logitech to convince its customers to use an app to control
                    their mouse. Such software can offer a lot of
                    programmability and macro support, but the need to
                    constantly run peripheral software could be a nuisance that
                    eats up computer resources. Earlier this year, users
                    complained when Logitech

                    to its peripherals.<br />[...]<br />Faber said subscription
                    software updates would mean that people wouldn't need to
                    worry about their mouse.<br />[...]<br />Having to pay a
                    regular fee for full use of a peripheral could deter
                    customers, though. HP is trying a similar idea with

                    A "forever mouse" would also benefit from a design with

                    Two U.S. senators are calling on the Federal Trade
                    Commission to investigate automakers selling customers'
                    driving data to brokers who package it and then sell it to

                    and perhaps others are sharing drivers' data, such as sudden
                    braking and acceleration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The automakers, the senators said in a statement Friday,
                    used deceptive tactics to manipulate customers into signing
                    up for disclosure of the data to brokers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After reading a report in The New York Times, Wyden's office
                    looked into the three automakers and found that they shared
                    data with broker
                    <a href="https://fortune.com/company/verisk-analytics/"
                      >Verisk Analytics</a
                    >. In the letter to Khan, the senators wrote that all three
                    automakers confirmed disclosure of the data. GM also
                    confirmed that it disclosed customer location data to two
                    other companies that the automaker would not name, the
                    letter said.<br />[...]<br />"If the FTC determines that
                    these companies violated the law, we urge you to hold the
                    companies and their senior executives accountable," the
                    senators wrote to Khan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    GM wouldn't say how many cars' data was sent to brokers or
                    what it was paid, according to the letter. Wyden's office
                    found that Hyundai shared data from 1.7 million vehicles and
                    was paid just over $1 million, while Honda got just under
                    $26,000 for data from 97,000 vehicles, the senators said.

                the above manufacturers? If so, were you aware of the data
                sales? Will this (perhaps depending on the outcome of an FTC

                    [...] This was a bug in their crawler that was causing it to
                    download the same files over and over again. There was no
                    bandwidth limiting in place, or support for Etags and
                    Last-Modified headers which would have allowed the crawler
                    to only download files that had changed. We have reported
                    this issue to them, and hopefully the issue will be fixed.

                    Pure sulfur had never been seen before on Mars. And while
                    sulfates have sulfur, there is not a clear relationship
                    between the formation of those molecules and the pure
                    crystals. Elemental sulfur crystals form only in a narrow
                    range of conditions. And none of those have been expected
                    for this region.

                    "Finding a field of stones made of pure sulfur is like
                    finding an oasis in the desert," Curiosity's project
                    scientist, Ashwin Vasavada of NASA's Jet Propulsion
                    Laboratory, said in a

                    The region Curiosity is exploring is known as the Gediz
                    Vallis channel. It is a groove across Mount Sharp that has
                    been an area of interest since long before the rover began
                    climbing the relief in 2014. From orbit, scientists could
                    see the presence of large mounds of debris. But the cause of
                    them was not apparent. Was it landslides or ancient
                    floodwaters that shifted the material along the channel?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Curiosity has been able to provide an answer. A bit of
                    column A and a bit of column B. Rocks shifted by water are
                    smoother and rounded. Those shifted by dry avalanches are
                    angular and sharp. Both types of rocks are found among the
                    mounds.

                    [...] There is often a group of protesters outside the
                    offices of OpenAI in San Francisco, holding "Pause AI"
                    banners. This sentiment will only grow if AI is left
                    unregulated. It may be tempting for countries to treat AI
                    development as an arms race, to rush ahead irrespective of

                    With a unanimous 5-0 vote, the FCC says it is moving forward
                    with plans that should make unlocking your mobile phone
                    easier than ever. According to
                    <a
                      href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-404092A1.pdf"

                    >, the agency say it will begin crafting new rules that will
                    require that wireless carriers unlock customers’ mobile
                    phones within 60<br />days of activation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At various times unlocking your phone was deemed downright
                    illegal under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
                    Things have eased some over the years; very often it’s now
                    possible to unlock your device and change carriers if your
                    phone is paid off and you’re no longer under contract.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the FCC noted that the current guidelines surrounding
                    unlocking are a mish mash of voluntary industry standards
                    and more stringent unlocking requirements usually affixed to
                    either merger conditions or the use of certain spectrum. The
                    new rules should create some uniformity, and the FCC is
                    contemplating whether they should even apply to users still
                    under contract with their wireless carrier.

                    industry. The industry already had to be dragged kicking and
                    screaming out of an era where it not only tried to lock down
                    devices, but tried to block consumer choice as it pertains
                    to apps, software and services (remember when Verizon

                    Chiseling away at the draconian DMCA as well as merger and
                    spectrum purchase conditions already did most of the heavy
                    lifting, and if the FCC’s rules are well crafted, they

                    Researchers have transformed guide RNAs, which direct
                    enzymes, into a smart RNA capable of controlling networks in
                    response to various signals. A research team consisting of
                    Professor Jongmin Kim and Ph.D. candidates Hansol Kang and
                    Dongwon Park from the Department of Life Sciences at POSTECH
                    has developed a multi-signal processing guide RNA.

                    [...] The CRISPR/Cas system, often referred to as "gene
                    scissors," is a technology capable of editing gene sequences
                    to add or delete biological functions. Central to this
                    technology, which is used in several fields such as treating
                    genetic diseases and genetically engineering crops, is a
                    guide RNA that directs the enzyme to edit the gene sequence
                    at a specific location.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While advances in RNA engineering have spurred research into
                    guide RNAs that respond to biological signals, achieving
                    precise control of networks of genes to respond to multiple
                    signals has remained challenging.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this study, the team combined the CRISPR/Cas system with
                    biocomputing to overcome these limitations. Biocomputing is
                    a technology that connects biological components like
                    electronic circuits to program cellular and organismal
                    activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers implemented a guide RNA gene circuit capable
                    of decision-making based on inputs, similar to a Boolean
                    logic gate, which is one of the fundamental representations
                    of input-output relationships in digitized signal
                    operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This study is significant because it integrates
                    existing systems and technologies to precisely control gene
                    networks, enabling the processing, integration, and response
                    to diverse signals within an organism. This goes beyond the

                    Professor Jongmin Kim of POSTECH stated, "The research could
                    enable the precise design of gene therapies based on
                    biological signals within complex genetic circuits involved
                    in disease. RNA molecular engineering allows for the
                    simplicity of software-based structure design which will
                    significantly advance the development of personalized

                    Tesla is warning users about a popular "charging hack" that
                    can allegedly result in shorter wait times at select
                    Supercharger stations. The trick, which has been circulating
                    within the Tesla community for at least a few years now,
                    involves wrapping a damp towel around a Supercharger handle
                    when charging. The idea is that the wet rag acts as a
                    cooling agent, tricking temperature sensors inside the
                    handle into thinking the system is running cooler than it
                    actually is.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some claim the hack can increase the charging rate,
                    especially on hot summer days, resulting in a faster charge
                    and less waiting around. Now, Tesla has issued official
                    guidance on the matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the official Tesla Charging account on X,
                    placing a wet cloth on a Supercharger handle does not
                    increase its charging rate. In does, however, interfere with
                    the system's temperature monitors and could lead to
                    overheating or damage. Tesla advises against the towel trick
                    to help ensure their systems can operate correctly.

                    Tesla's claim that the trick does not work, at least with
                    older V2 Supercharging systems. One Tesla user put a damp
                    cloth over the charging handle on a V2 Supercharger, which
                    increased the charging rate from 60 kilowatts to 95 kW on a
                    hot day. Another user plugged in at two percent stage of
                    charge and reached 147 kW before thermal throttling kicked
                    in at 34 percent and slowed the rate down to 58 kW. Applying
                    a wet rag reportedly drove the charging rate up to 119 kW.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    V3 and newer Superchargers utilize active cooling. According
                    to Inside EV, the towel trick does not really help at all on
                    these systems unless you are charging a Cybertruck.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tesla owners would probably be best served to take the
                    company's advice and not fool with the trick. Saving an
                    extra few minutes simply is not worth the risk of damaging
                    your vehicle or Tesla's equipment.

                    by Ireland's Central Statistics Office (CSO) highlights the
                    explosive growth of energy consumption in data centers. The
                    electricity required by data center operators increased by
                    20 percent between 2022 and 2023, and the total metered
                    energy consumption equaled 21 percent of Ireland's capacity
                    in 2023.

                  <p>
                    Data centers now exceed the energy needs of both urban and
                    rural households, which accounted for 18 percent and 10
                    percent of total metered electricity consumption,
                    respectively. In 2023, the CSO recorded a truly
                    unprecedented increase in power required by Ireland's data
                    centers, rising from 290 gigawatt hours in 2015 to 1,661
                    gigawatt hours, a staggering 473 percent increase.

                    [...] A recent report from the International Energy Agency
                    (IEA) warned about the growing global energy demand by data
                    centers, which could double in just a couple of years. By
                    2026, Ireland may be forced to reserve almost a third of its
                    entire energy supply (32 percent) for data center operators
                    alone.

                    to widespread blackouts and reliability issues. However,

                    Archaeological findings at the renowned Mesolithic site of
                    Star Carr in North Yorkshire suggest that hunter-gatherers
                    maintained an ordered living space by designating specific
                    ‘zones’ for various domestic activities.

                    looked at microscopic evidence from the use of stone tools
                    found inside three structures – potentially cone-like in
                    shape or domed – dating to over 11,000 years ago at the Star

                    They found that there was a range of activities that were
                    likely to have taken place inside the ‘home’, including
                    wood, bone, antler, plant, hide, meat, and fish-related
                    work. The researchers then plotted out spatial patterns for
                    these activities to pinpoint where within the dwelling these
                    activities might have occurred.

                    Dr Jess Bates, from the University of York’s Department of
                    Archaeology, said: “We found that there were distinct areas
                    for different types of activity, so the messy activity
                    involving butchery, for example, was done in what appears to
                    be a designated space, and separate to the ‘cleaner’ tasks
                    such as crafting bone and wooden objects, tools or jewelry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “This was surprising as hunter-gatherers are known for being
                    very mobile, as they would have to travel out to find food,
                    and yet they have a very organized approach to creating not
                    just a house but a sense of home.

                    [...] Star Carr provides the earliest known evidence of
                    British dwellings and some of the earliest forms of
                    architecture. One of the structures found was believed to be
                    shaped like a cone and was constructed out of wood from
                    felled trees, as well as coverings possibly made from
                    plants, like reeds, or animal hides. There is still very
                    little known about why hunter-gatherers would build such
                    structures and continued to throughout the Mesolithic
                    period.

                    Dr. Bates said: “Not only do we now know that
                    hunter-gatherers were constructing these dwellings, but they
                    had a shared group understanding of how to organize tasks
                    within them.

                    “In modern society, we are very attached to our homes both
                    physically and emotionally, but in the deep past communities
                    were highly mobile so it is fascinating to see that despite
                    this there is still this concept of keeping an orderly home
                    space.

                    The Hubble Space Telescope zooms in on a dense ball of
                    millions of stars within a galaxy orbiting the Milky Way.
                    Its ancient origins raise big questions about how galaxies
                    form and grow, [known as ] Globular cluster NGC 2005
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is 162,000 light-years away, in the Large Magellanic
                    Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and visible in
                    the constellation Dorado
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This new image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows an
                    object with mysterious origins that's commonly seen in the
                    Milky Way: a globular cluster, a densely packed and
                    gravitationally bound group of tens of thousands or millions
                    of stars. However, NGC 2005 is actually located in the Large
                    Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a dwarf galaxy close to the Milky
                    Way, and can be easily seen at night from the Southern
                    Hemisphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Globular clusters are thought to be billions of years old.
                    About 150 are known to exist in the halo of the Milky Way.
                    They orbit its center in the opposite direction as most
                    other objects in our galaxy, providing evidence for a theory
                    that they were captured while the Milky Way was merging with
                    other galaxies, according to NASA. That's how astronomers
                    think galaxies evolve and grow. Another clue is that
                    globular clusters host some of the oldest stars in the
                    universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NGC 2005 is the perfect test case because it exists outside
                    the Milky Way but is close enough to be studied carefully.
                    It's about 750 light-years from the heart of the LMC, the
                    biggest of about 40 dwarf galaxies near the Milky Way. Many
                    of these dwarf galaxies are thought to orbit the Milky Way,
                    though recent data from the Gaia spacecraft suggest that
                    many of them may just be passing by.

                    While NTIA purports to give States the flexibility to choose

                    Researchers from Japan have been working hard to keep their
                    cool—or at least—keep their nanodevices from overheating. By
                    adding a tiny coating of silicon dioxide to micro-sized
                    silicon structures, they were able to show a significant
                    increase in the rate of heat dissipated. This work may lead
                    to smaller and cheaper electronic devices that can pack in
                    more microcircuits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As consumer electronics become ever more compact, while
                    still boasting increased processing power, the need to
                    manage waste heat from microcircuits has grown to become a
                    major concern. Some scientific instruments and nanoscale
                    machines require careful consideration of how localized heat
                    will be shunted out of the device in order to prevent
                    damage. Some cooling occurs when heat is radiated away as
                    electromagnetic waves—similar to how the sun’s power reaches
                    the Earth through the vacuum of space. However, the rate of
                    energy transfer can be too slow to protect the performance
                    of sensitive and densely packed integrated electronic
                    circuits. For the next generation of devices to be
                    developed, novel approaches may need to be established to
                    address this issue of heat transmission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a study recently published in the journal
                    <em>Physical Review Letters</em>, researchers from the
                    Institute of Industrial Science at the University of Tokyo,
                    showed how the rate of radiative heat transfer can be
                    doubled between two micro-scale silicon plates separated by
                    a tiny gap. The key was using a coating of silicon dioxide
                    that created a coupling between the thermal vibrations of
                    the plate at the surface (called phonons) and the photons
                    (which make up the radiation).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “We were able to show both theoretically and experimentally
                    how electromagnetic waves were excited at the interface of
                    the oxide layer that enhanced the rate of heat transfer,”
                    lead author of the study, Saeko Tachikawa says. The small
                    size of the layers compared with the wavelengths of the
                    electromagnetic energy and its attachment to the silicon
                    plate, which carries the energy without loss, allowed the
                    device to surpass the normal limits of heat transfer, and
                    thus cool faster.
                  </p>

                    Because current microelectronics are already based on
                    silicon, the findings of this research could be easily
                    integrated into future generations of semiconductor devices.
                    “Our work provides insight into possible heat dissipation
                    management strategies in the semiconductor industry, along
                    with various other related fields such as nanotech
                    manufacturing,” says senior author, Masahiro Nomura. The
                    research also helps to establish a better fundamental
                    understanding of how heat transfer works at the nanoscale
                    level, since this is still an area of active research.

                    The repository included the private portion of the platform
                    key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was
                    protected by a four-character password, a decision that made
                    it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing
                    curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the
                    corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went
                    largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly
                    researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain
                    incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security
                    experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances
                    offered by Secure Boot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers soon discovered that the compromise of
                    the key was just the beginning of a much bigger supply-chain
                    breakdown that raises serious doubts about the integrity of
                    Secure Boot on more than 300 additional device models from
                    virtually all major device manufacturers. As is the case
                    with the platform key compromised in the 2022 GitHub leak,
                    an additional 21 platform keys contain the strings "DO NOT
                    SHIP" or "DO NOT TRUST."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] People who want to know if their Windows device uses
                    one of the test platform keys can run the following
                    powershell command:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &gt;
                    [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString((Get-SecureBootUEFI<br />PK).bytes)
                    -match "DO NOT TRUST|DO NOT SHIP"<br />True
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Linux users can detect one of the test certificates by
                    displaying the content of the PK variable:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    $ efi-readvar -v PK<br />Variable PK, length 862<br />PK:
                    List 0, type X509<br />Signature 0, size 834, owner

                    NOT TRUST - AMI Test PK<br />Issuer:<br />CN=DO NOT TRUST -
                    AMI Test PK

                  <p>
                    There's little that users of an affected device can do other
                    than install a patch if one becomes available from the
                    manufacturer. In the meantime, it's worth remembering that
                    Secure Boot has a history of not living up to its promises.
                    The most recent reminder came late last year with the
                    disclosure of LogoFAIL, a constellation of image-parsing
                    vulnerabilities in UEFI libraries from just about every
                    device maker. By replacing the legitimate logo images with
                    identical-looking ones that have been specially crafted to
                    exploit these bugs, LogoFAIL makes it possible to execute
                    malicious code at the most sensitive stage of the boot
                    process, which is known as DXE, short for Driver Execution
                    Environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "My takeaway is 'yup, [manufacturers] still screw up Secure
                    Boot, this time due to lazy key management,' but it wasn't
                    obviously a change in how I see the world (secure boot being
                    a fig leaf security measure in many cases)," HD Moore, a
                    firmware security expert and CTO and co-founder at runZero,
                    said after reading the Binarly report. "The story is that
                    the whole UEFI supply chain is a hot mess and hasn't
                    improved much since 2016."

                    Vivalt doesn't view the dip in hours spent working as a
                    negative outcome of the experiment, either. On the contrary,
                    according to Vivalt. "People are doing more stuff, and if
                    the results say people value having more leisure time — that
                    this is what increases their well-being — that's positive."

                    In other words, the cash transfers gave recipients more
                    autonomy over how they spent their time, according to
                    Vivalt.

                    "It gives people the choice to make their own decisions
                    about what they want to do. In that sense, it necessarily
                    improves their well-being," she said.

                    Researchers expected that participants would ultimately earn
                    higher wages by taking on better-paid work, but that
                    scenario didn't pan out. "They thought that if you can
                    search longer for work because you have more of a cushion,
                    you can afford to wait for better jobs, or maybe you quit
                    bad jobs," Vivalt said. "But we don't find any effects on
                    the quality of employment whatsoever."

                    Cash transfer recipients experienced a 26% increase in the
                    number of hospitalizations in the last year, compared with
                    the average control recipient. The average recipient also
                    experienced a 10% increase in the probability of having
                    visited an emergency department in the last year.

                    could have created the leopard splotches, such as mineral
                    deposits from past flows of water. In the announcement, the
                    agency included the helpful graphic below, showing the
                    Confidence of Life Detection scale, or CoLD. With this
                    detection, NASA is at number one.

                    And, crucially, to move up the scale, the sample (from a
                    rock named Cheyava Falls) must be closely analyzed in labs
                    on Earth, with far more instruments than the distant,
                    car-sized rover can carry. This can prove if non-biological
                    factors actually formed the structures, confirm the presence
                    of past life, rule out other hypotheses, and beyond. NASA's

                    agency can't afford. The agency now seeks a financially
                    feasible plan for the complex endeavor, which would retrieve
                    samples and rocket them back to Earth.

                    In a ferroelectric material, positive and negative charges
                    spontaneously head to different sides, or poles. Upon the
                    application of an external electric field, those charges
                    switch sides, reversing the polarization. Switching the
                    polarization can be used to encode digital information, and
                    that information will be nonvolatile, or stable over time.
                    It won’t change unless an electric field is applied. For a
                    ferroelectric to have broad application to electronics, all
                    of this needs to happen at room temperature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new ferroelectric material <a
                      href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/physicists-engineer-ferroelectricity-in-boron-nitride-0915"
                      >reported in <em>Science</em> in 2021</a
                    >
                    is based on atomically thin sheets of boron nitride that are
                    stacked parallel to each other, a configuration that doesn’t
                    exist in nature. In bulk boron nitride, the individual
                    layers of boron nitride are instead rotated by 180 degrees.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It turns out that when an electric field is applied to this
                    parallel stacked configuration, one layer of the new boron
                    nitride material slides over the other, slightly changing
                    the positions of the boron and nitrogen atoms. For example,
                    imagine that each of your hands is composed of only one
                    layer of cells. The new phenomenon is akin to pressing your
                    hands together then slightly shifting one above the other.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “So the miracle is that by sliding the two layers a few
                    angstroms, you end up with radically different electronics,”
                    says Ashoori. The diameter of an atom is about 1 angstrom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another miracle: “nothing wears out in the sliding,” Ashoori
                    continues. That’s why the new transistor could be switched
                    100 billion times without degrading. Compare that to the
                    memory in a flash drive made with conventional materials.
                    “Each time you write and erase a flash memory, you get some
                    degradation,” says Ashoori. “Over time, it wears out, which
                    means that you have to use some very sophisticated methods
                    for distributing where you’re reading and writing on the
                    chip.” The new material could make those steps obsolete.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yasuda, the co-first author of the current
                    <em>Science</em> paper, applauds the collaborations involved
                    in the work. Among them, “we [Jarillo-Herrero’s team] made
                    the material and, together with Ray [Ashoori] and [co-first
                    author] Evan [Zalys-Geller], we measured its characteristics
                    in detail. That was very exciting.” Says Ashoori, “many of
                    the techniques in my lab just naturally applied to work that
                    was going on in the lab next door. It’s been a lot of fun.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ashoori notes that “there’s a lot of interesting physics
                    behind this” that could be explored. For example, “if you
                    think about the two layers sliding past each other, where
                    does that sliding start?” In addition, says Yasuda, could
                    the ferroelectricity be triggered with something other than
                    electricity, like an optical pulse? And is there a
                    fundamental limit to the amount of switches the material can
                    make?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Challenges remain. For example, the current way of producing
                    the new ferroelectrics is difficult and not conducive to
                    mass manufacturing. “We made a single transistor as a
                    demonstration. If people could grow these materials on the
                    wafer scale, we could create many, many more,” says Yasuda.
                    He notes that different groups are already working to that
                    end.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Concludes Ashoori, “There are a few problems. But if you
                    solve them, this material fits in so many ways into
                    potential future electronics. It’s very exciting.”

                    On Monday, it initially seemed like the beginning of the end
                    for Intel's desktop CPU instability woes — the company
                    confirmed a patch is coming in mid-August that should
                    address the "root cause" of exposure to elevated voltage.
                    But if your 13th or 14th Gen Intel Core processor is already
                    crashing, that patch apparently won't fix it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Citing unnamed sources, Tom's Hardware reports that any
                    degradation of the processor is irreversible, and an Intel
                    spokesperson did not deny that when we asked. Intel is
                    "confident" the patch will keep it from happening in the
                    first place. (As another preventative measure, you should
                    update your motherboard BIOS ASAP.) But if your defective
                    CPU has been damaged, your best option is to replace it
                    instead of tweaking BIOS settings to try and alleviate the
                    problems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And, Intel confirms, too-high voltages aren't the only
                    reason some of these chips are failing. Intel spokesperson
                    Thomas Hannaford confirms it's a primary cause, but the
                    company is still investigating. Intel community manager Lex
                    Hoyos also revealed some instability reports can be traced
                    back to an oxidization manufacturing issue that was fixed at
                    an unspecified date last year.
