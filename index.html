                Several sites are reporting on Qualcomm's increasing Linux
                support. The tide is turning and the Microsoft monopoly on OEMs,
                at least the non-x86 ones, might be weakening as full Linux
                support is now expected on the modern hardware architectures
                these days:

                    Here's the thing. In the Linux world, ARM has had something
                    like a 15-year head start over Microsoft's own often anemic
                    ARM efforts, thanks to the Raspberry Pi and single-board
                    computers making the platform a good choice for more than
                    just basic web-surfers.

                    far from done, as there's still a lot of development work
                    needed to get the X Elite into a fully operational state in

                    Qualcomm prides itself on its Linux enablement work and has
                    prioritized Linux enablement in all of its previous
                    Snapdragon laptop CPUs, typically announcing Linux support
                    one or two days after launch. The Snapdragon X Elite
                    continues that pattern, with Linux enablement being
                    announced the very next day after its original October 23,
                    2023 debut.

                It seems that the Asahi Linux project has also done great work
                on the M-series chips despite Apple. There, Apple still has to
                get up to speed.

                    private providers offer service or will offer service "in
                    the reasonably foreseeable future." That restriction had

                    over 70 percent of the market for DRAM and NAND flash. But
                    beyond Samsung's modest Exynos SoC operation (which can't
                    even satisfy demand for its own Galaxy smartphones), South
                    Korea is not home to a notable manufacturer of high-value
                    processors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Samsung and SK hynix have also made enormous bets on
                    factories to produce more memory – some on the peninsula and
                    others stateside (where they could attract funds from Uncle
                    Sam).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    South Korea's new funding package is tiny compared to the
                    sums its chip champions are spending, so it's unlikely it
                    will divert their efforts notably. Nor will it deter them
                    continuing to target the so-hot-right-now memory market, in
                    which demand for DDR5 and related variants – plus high
                    bandwidth memory (HBM) – is currently rampant. Indeed, SK
                    hynix has already found buyers for all the HBM it can make
                    in 2024 and most of the chips it will produce in 2025.

                    Six family members caught a rare parasitic worm infection
                    after sharing a meal that included black bear meat, which
                    was initially served rare after being stored frozen for more

                    Two of the people reported only eating vegetables at the
                    meal, so it's likely that the infected meat contaminated

                    published Thursday (May 23) by the Centers for Disease
                    Control and Prevention (CDC). Between 2016 and 2022, only 35
                    probable and confirmed cases of the disease were recorded.

                    meat was the suspected or confirmed source of infection in
                    the majority of those outbreaks," the report noted.

                    Trichinellosis occurs when people inadvertently consume
                    larvae of a roundworm in the <em>Trichinella</em> genus. The
                    worm commonly infects bears, wild boars, wildcats, foxes,
                    wolves, seals and walruses. People typically become infected
                    after consuming raw or undercooked meat from infected
                    animals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Historically, people in the U.S. sometimes contracted the
                    infection from raw or undercooked commercial pork products,
                    but modern regulations and cooking guidelines have lowered
                    this risk.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The newly reported case took place in 2022, when a
                    29-year-old man in Minnesota was hospitalized with a fever,
                    severe muscle aches and pains and swelling around the eyes.
                    He was also found to have a high number of immune cells
                    called eosinophilia, a sign of infection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Within a span of about half a month, the man had sought
                    medical attention for his symptoms four times and was
                    hospitalized twice. During the second hospitalization, he
                    reported having consumed bear meat, and the medical team
                    started him on medication for parasitic worms, just in case.
                    They later confirmed he was carrying antibodies against
                    <em>Trichinella</em> worms, and an investigation was
                    launched to check for more cases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    About a week before he got sick, the Minnesota man had met
                    up with nine family members in South Dakota. They'd shared a
                    meal that included kabobs made with black bear (<em
                      >Ursus americanus</em
                    >) meat, which was originally harvested in Canada by one of
                    the attending family members. It had been frozen for 45 days
                    before being thawed, cooked and served with vegetables.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The hunting outfitter had recommended freezing the meat to
                    kill parasites," the CDC report notes. But some
                    <em>Trichinella</em> species can survive being frozen. (This
                    includes <em>Trichinella</em><em>nativa</em>, which turned
                    out to be the species likely involved in this case.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The meat was initially inadvertently served rare,
                    reportedly because the meat was dark in color, and it was
                    difficult for the family members to visually ascertain the
                    level of doneness," the report noted. Some family members
                    noticed the meat was underdone while eating it, and it was
                    then cooked a bit more before being served again.

                    Proteins linked to cancer can start appearing in people's
                    blood more than seven years before they're diagnosed, our
                    funded researchers have found. In the future, it's possible
                    doctors could use these early warning signs to find and
                    treat cancer much earlier than they're able to today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Across two studies, researchers at
                    <a href="https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/"
                      >Oxford Population Health</a
                    >
                    identified 618 proteins linked to 19 different types of
                    cancer, including 107 proteins in a group of people whose
                    blood was collected at least seven years before they were
                    diagnosed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings suggest that these proteins could be involved
                    at the very earliest stages of cancer. Intercepting them
                    could give us a way to stop the disease developing
                    altogether.

                    much more attainable," explained Dr Karl Smith-Byrne, Senior
                    Molecular Epidemiologist at Oxford Population Health, who
                    worked on both papers.

                  <p>
                    For now, though, we need to do further research. The team
                    want to find out more about the roles these proteins play in
                    cancer development, how we can use tests to spot the most
                    important ones, and which drugs we can use to stop them
                    driving cancer.

                    Their analysis of 1,463 proteins in each sample revealed 107

                    and 182 that changed at least three years before a cancer

                    cancer. While altering these proteins may increase or
                    decrease the chances of someone developing cancer, more
                    research is needed to make sure targeting them with drugs

                The BBC is running a podcast on "Archive on 4" called "Turning

                I remember greatly enjoying that book in the 1970s, made a real
                impression and it changed how I thought about certain things.
                This podcast was a great refresher. It even includes original
                interviews with Robert Persig (the author) and others close to
                the creation of the book.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the backstory behind the book was eye opening (but other
                parts were easy enough to work out just by reading it). For
                example, Persig flogged his original manuscript to many, many
                publishers before he got a nibble. Then he gives a lot of credit
                to a young editor who convinced him to change from (iirc) first
                to third person (via an unmamed observer) -- resulting in the
                eventual great success of the book.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, the podcast can't resist revisiting the oft-quoted
                beer can shim story...or am I confusing that with a recent post
                on a motorcycle maintenance forum (grin)?

                    The EU is concerned that Bing’s AI features could impact
                    elections, while the UK’s CMA has decided not to investigate
                    Microsoft’s partnership with Mistral AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The EU has Microsoft on its regulatory radar, as it has sent
                    the company a legally binding request for information about
                    Bing’s generative AI features.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The European Commission said this request for information is
                    based on suspicions that Bing may have breached the

                    (DSA) due to risks linked to generative AI. These risks
                    include AI ‘hallucinations’, the viral spread of deepfakes
                    and the “automated manipulation of services that can mislead
                    voters”.

                    [...] Meanwhile, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority
                    (CMA) has opted to not investigate Microsoft’s partnership

                    the CMA had concerns around whether the agreements between
                    the two companies qualified as a merger deal.

                  <p>
                    As part of that effort, the CMA looked into the minority
                    investment deals agreed by Microsoft and Mistral. The
                    regulator had concerns that the links between the two

                    But in a brief statement released today (17 May), the CMA
                    decided that Microsoft’s partnership with Mistral AI “does
                    not qualify for investigation” under the merger provisions
                    in the UK.

                    The wreckage of a US Navy submarine that sank the most
                    Japanese warships during World War Two has been found in the
                    South China Sea, some 80 years after it was sunk by enemy
                    forces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The USS Harder was found 3,000ft (914m) below water off the
                    Philippines' northern island of Luzon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Harder was sunk in battle on 29 August 1944, along with
                    its crew of 79 men.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In one of its final war patrols, it sank three Japanese
                    destroyers and heavily damaged two others over four days,
                    according to the US Navy's History and Heritage Command
                    (NHHC).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This forced the Japanese to change their battle plans and
                    delay their carrier force, contributing to their defeat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Harder was lost in the course of victory. We must not
                    forget that victory has a price, as does freedom," said
                    Samuel J. Cox, a retired US admiral who heads the NHHC.

                    The Philippines was one of the main Pacific battlegrounds of
                    World War Two, as the US fought to retake its former colony
                    from the Japanese Imperial Army.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Waters in and around the archipelago have served as the
                    resting place of famed World War Two battleships.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Harder, which sailed under the motto of "Hit 'em
                    harder', was found by the Lost 52 project, which aims to
                    find the 52 US submarines lost during World War Two. It was
                    found sitting upright on its keel or spine, and relatively
                    intact, the US Navy said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The submarine and its crew were later awarded the
                    Presidential Unit Citation for its service during the war.
                    The honour recognises extraordinary heroism in action.

                , Microsoft is introducing a new "feature" in Windows 11:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    If you haven't read about it yet, Recall is an AI feature
                    coming to Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs. It's designed to let you
                    go back in time on your computer by "taking images of your
                    active screen every few seconds" and analyzing them with AI,
                    according to Microsoft's Recall FAQs. If anyone other than
                    you gets access to that Recall data, it could be disastrous.
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    On the surface, this sounds like a cool feature, but that
                    paranoid privacy purist in the back of my mind is burying
                    his face in a pillow and screaming. Imagine if almost
                    everything you had done for the past three months was
                    recorded for anyone with access to your computer to see.
                    Well, if you use Recall, you won't have to imagine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That might seem like an overreaction, but let me explain:
                    Recall is taking screenshots every few seconds and storing
                    them on your device. Adding encryption into the mix, that's
                    an enormous amount of bloaty visual data that will show
                    almost everything you've been doing on your computer during
                    that period.
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Microsoft openly
                    admits that Recall will be taking screenshots of your
                    passwords and private data:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Note that Recall does not perform content moderation. It
                    will not hide information such as passwords or financial
                    account numbers. That data may be in snapshots that are
                    stored on your device, especially when sites do not follow
                    standard internet protocols like cloaking password entry."
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    Arguably, the worst part about this is that it will be on by
                    default once you activate your device. Microsoft states:
                  </p>
                  <p>        On by default</p>
                </div>

                    collaborations with third parties. In particular, the
                    company said it would launch its all-new 256-core AmpereOne
                    processor next year, made on TSMC's N3 process technology.
                    Also, Ampere is teaming up with Qualcomm to build AI
                    inference servers with the company's accelerators.
                    Apparently, Huawei is also looking at integrating
                    third-party UCIe-compatible chiplets into its own platforms.

                  <p>
                    Ampere has begun shipping 192-core AmpereOne processors with
                    an eight-channel DDR5 memory subsystem it introduced a year
                    ago. Later this year, the company plans to introduce
                    192-core AmpereOne CPUs with a 12-channel DDR5 memory
                    subsystem, requiring a brand-new platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next year, the company will use this platform for its
                    256-core AmpereOne CPU, which will be made using one of
                    TSMC's N3 fabrication processes. The company does not
                    disclose whether the new processor will also feature a new
                    microarchitecture, though it looks like it will continue to
                    feature 2 MB of L2 cache per core.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are extending our product family to include a new
                    256-core product that delivers 40% more performance than any
                    other CPU in the market," said Renee James, chief executive
                    of Ampere. "It is not just about cores. It is about what you
                    can do with the platform. We have several new features that
                    enable efficient performance, memory, caching, and AI
                    compute." 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company says that its 256-core CPU will use the same
                    cooling system as its existing offerings, which implies that
                    its thermal design power will remain in the 350-watt
                    ballpark. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Ampere can certainly address many general-purpose
                    cloud instances, its capabilities for AI are fairly limited.
                    The company itself says that its 128-core AmpereOne CPU with
                    its two 128-bit vector units per core (and supporting INT8,
                    INT16, FP16, and BFloat16 formats) can offer performance
                    comparable to Nvidia's A10 GPU, albeit at lower power. [...]
                    So, it teamed up with Qualcomm, and the two companies plan
                    to build platforms for LLM inferencing based on Ampere's
                    CPUs and <a

                    Neuralink, the Elon Musk-funded neuroscience startup, has
                    received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
                    to implant its next patient with its experimental brain
                    chip. This next operation will seek to fix certain issues
                    that occurred following its first implantation operation.

                    paraplegic man, Noland Arbaugh, in an operation that was
                    publicly announced this past January. Arbaugh’s identity was
                    revealed during a

                    in March, during which the patient demonstrated some of the
                    abilities the chip had given him, including the chance to
                    play computer chess with his mind. It was recently revealed,
                    however, that Arbaugh’s chip had malfunctioned and, for a
                    period of time, experienced data leakage.

                    The company has now received federal approval to continue
                    implanting patients with its chip, with the promise that it
                    will work out the kinks that caused problems with Arbaugh’s
                    chip, the Wall Street Journal

                      >originally reported</a
                    >. Arbaugh’s chip malfunctioned because some of the tiny
                    wires attached to the chip came loose and stopped channeling
                    signals from his brain to the company’s servers. In its next
                    operation, Neuralink plans to embed these tiny wires deeper
                    into the next patient’s brain. A source told the newspaper
                    that the company wants to implant as many as 10 additional
                    people with its chip by the end of this year.

                  <p>
                    Arbaugh recently opened up about his experience with the
                    company in a series of press interviews. During a
                    <a

                      >conversation with Bloomberg</a
                    >, Arbaugh explained the disappointment he felt when the
                    chip began malfunctioning:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “I started losing control of the cursor. I thought they’d
                    made some changes and that was the reason...But then they
                    told me that the threads were getting pulled out of my
                    brain. At first, they didn’t know how serious it would be or
                    a ton about it...It was really hard to hear. I thought I’d
                    gotten to use it for maybe a month, and then my journey was
                    coming to an end. I thought they would just keep collecting
                    some data but that they were really going to move on to the
                    next person. I cried a little bit.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, Arbaugh says that updates to the chip’s software
                    have allowed him to regain many of the abilities that he
                    previously had and that he is still very supportive of
                    Neuralink and what it’s done for him.

                    which took place at its Boca Chica Starbase facilities in

                    The footage started a little after 4:12 pm local time.
                    Roughly 14 seconds after ignition, the Raptor engine shut
                    off. As the vapor surrounding the test tower dissipated, a
                    fire appeared to start underneath the engine. These flames
                    traveled upwards, causing a second explosion to engulf the
                    entire tower.

                    Unresponsiveness in a distributed file system happened after
                    just 2.4 minutes of acoustic targeting, which also caused a
                    database's latency to increase by up to 92.7 percent. The
                    researchers say this method can completely destroy some
                    drives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The attacks were carried out 20 feet away from the
                    equipment, but Islam said some simple underwater robotics
                    could disrupt data centers from miles away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers looked at ways of mitigating the attacks:
                    sound-proof panels, but that raised the servers'
                    temperatures too much, and increasing the volume bypassed
                    this method; and active noise cancellation, which proved too
                    cumbersome and expensive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The ocean is awash in sound already. We've
                    demonstrated that these attacks can happen inadvertently
                    from something like a submarine sonar blast, which is
                    extremely loud," said co-author Kevin Butler, Ph.D., a UF
                    professor and director of the Florida Institute for
                    Cybersecurity Research. "So it's that much more important
                    that we know how to defend against these attacks. These are
                    issues that haven't been studied at all by the security
                    community."

                    "[Social Media] platforms select the content they show you,"
                    Zaman says. "They can promote anything, demote anything.
                    That means they can shift opinions any way they want."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As far as most social media users know, the most powerful
                    tool through which platforms steer public opinion is through
                    the outright removal of objectionable content or users. But
                    Zaman argues that there's a more potent means through which
                    social media platforms can control collective opinions over
                    time, called "shadow banning." Part of this tool's power
                    derives from the fact that it's currently near-impossible to
                    uncover, even by policymakers or software engineering
                    experts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For the study, the researchers built a simulation of a
                    real social network, and then succeeded in using shadow
                    banning to shift simulated users' opinions as well as
                    increasing and decreasing polarization. Even when the goal
                    was to use shadow banning to move collective sentiment to
                    the right or left, Zaman says, the content moderation policy
                    appeared neutral from an outside perspective. That's because
                    it's possible, he discovered, to shift opinions by turning
                    down the volume on accounts on both sides of a debate at the
                    same time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's like a frog sitting in a pot of water; the frog's
                    relaxing, and suddenly, he's cooked," Zaman said. "A network
                    could, in fact, be driving people towards one point of view,
                    but if someone tries to call them out on it—like a
                    regulatory body—they're going to see the network censoring
                    both sides equally," Zaman says. "It looks like there's
                    nothing untoward happening, so they leave the network
                    alone—and suddenly everybody thinks the earth's flat. That's
                    what we find you could do with our technique, which is a
                    little scary."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Zaman plans to share his research with policymakers.
                    "I want to show them, 'Here's what this network can do; this
                    is the danger,'" he says. "If you're not going to ban them
                    but want to regulate them, this is how to do it—by
                    quantifying their content algorithm. This is how we should
                    be regulating all of the networks—X, Meta, Instagram,
                    YouTube, all of them.'"

                  <p>
                    May 20 (Reuters) - Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google has
                    preemptively paid damages to the U.S. government, an unusual
                    move aimed at avoiding a jury trial in the Justice
                    Department's antitrust lawsuit over its digital advertising
                    business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google disclosed the payment, but not the amount, in a court
                    filing last week that said the case should be heard and
                    decided by a judge directly. Without a monetary damages
                    claim, Google argued, the government has no right to a jury
                    trial.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Justice Department, which has not said if it will accept
                    the payment, declined to comment on the filing. Google
                    asserted that its check, which it said covered its alleged
                    overcharges for online ads, allows it to sidestep a jury
                    trial whether or not the government takes it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Justice Department filed the case last year with
                    Virginia and other states, alleging Google was stifling
                    competition for advertising technology. The government has
                    said Google should be forced to sell its ad manager suite.

                    Stanford Law School's Mark Lemley told Reuters he was
                    skeptical Google's gambit would prevail. He said a jury
                    could ultimately decide higher damages than whatever Google
                    put forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Antitrust cases regularly go to juries. I think it is a
                    sign that Google is worried about what a jury will do,"
                    Lemley said.

                    Another legal scholar, Herbert Hovenkamp of the University
                    of Pennsylvania's law school, called Google's move "smart"
                    in a post on X. "Juries are bad at deciding technical cases,
                    and further they do not have the authority to order a
                    breakup," he wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 2016 case that an offer
                    for "complete relief" did not wipe out a class-action claim.
                    But Google argued its payment is different, because it
                    submitted an actual check and not merely an offer.

                    Why? The China-backed MineOne facility is located less than
                    a mile from the Francis E. Warren Air Force base, where a
                    not insignificant number of nuclear tipped Minuteman III
                    intercontinental ballistic missiles are housed. This,
                    according to the White House, makes MineOne a national
                    security risk.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    MineOne acquired the property in 2022 with the goal of
                    operating a crypto mining facility on the site, the order
                    states. However, the sale wasn't registered with the
                    Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)
                    until after the government body received a tip from a member
                    of the public about the facility.

                    equipment, potentially capable of facilitating surveillance
                    and espionage activities, presents a national security risk
                    to the United States," the order reads.

                    [...] The executive order also placed limits on who MineOne
                    could sell to, presumably in an attempt to prevent the
                    datacenter from being transferred into another foreign firm.
                    If MineOne fails to comply with the order, the White House
                    has authorized the Attorney General to take any steps
                    necessary to enforce it, which presumably includes seizing

                    multiyear scheme. Oleksandr Didenko, 27, of Kyiv, Ukraine,
                    allegedly helped individuals in North Korea "market"

                    when she or Didenko were scheduled to make their first
                    appearance in court. If convicted, Chapman faces 97.5 years

                    Nickel monosilicide (NiSi) is widely used to connect
                    transistors in semiconductor circuits. Earlier theoretical
                    calculations had incorrectly predicted that NiSi was not
                    magnetic. As a result, researchers had never fully explored
                    magnetism in NiSi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Recently, however, scientists used neutron scattering to
                    identify an elusive form of magnetic order in NiSi. The
                    research is

                    in the journal <i>Advanced Materials</i>.

                  <p>
                    [...] Because NiSi is extensively used by the semiconductor
                    industry, it is already compatible with chip manufacturing.
                    Physicists used neutron scattering at the Spallation Neutron
                    Source, a Department of Energy user facility at Oak Ridge
                    National Laboratory, to uncover magnetic order in single
                    crystal NiSi that had not been previously known.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The robust magnetic structure and coupling of
                    magnetic-electronic properties of NiSi offer the opportunity
                    to use NiSi for magnetic memory applications. The research
                    team also applied density functional theory combined with
                    the self-(electron) interaction correction method (instead
                    of using the local density approximation) to identify the
                    origin of magnetism as arising from hybridization between Ni
                    3d orbitals and Si sp states.

                  <p>
                    Harnessing the newly discovered magnetism of NiSi in
                    semiconductors may lead to faster computers and computer
                    memory. The unique magnetism in NiSi is attractive because
                    electronics that use magnetism to store and process data are
                    reliable, fast, and small. The result is increased
                    capabilities at lower costs. The work also highlights the
                    need for improvements in how scientists apply conventional
                    modeling to certain materials.

                    As millions of American workers have been thrown out of work
                    by the Covid-19 pandemic and filed unemployment claims, many
                    states' computer systems have not been able to keep pace.

                    In early April, during his daily press conference related to
                    the coronavirus crisis, New Jersey governor Phil Murphy made
                    an appeal for volunteer programmers who know COBOL, the
                    computer language on which the state's unemployment benefits
                    system operates.

                    "Literally, we have systems that are 40-plus-years-old,"
                    Murphy said. "There'll be lots of postmortems. and one of
                    them on our list will be, how did we get here where we
                    literally needed COBOL programmers?"

                    The May 2024 edition of the TIOBE Index includes a couple of
                    surprising results, placing two of the most ancient
                    programming languages among the top spots in popularity
                    among developers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Fortran, a compiled language originally created by IBM
                    in 1957, is especially suited to numeric computation and
                    scientific computing tasks. According to the index, this
                    ancient language is still the 10th most popular programming
                    technology. Fortran reentered the top 10 after more than 20
                    years, and TIOBE Software CEO Paul Jansen has provided some
                    explanations for this seemingly odd situation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The TIOBE Index simply "publishes what has been measured,"
                    and Fortran is apparently the subject of more than a
                    thousand books available on Amazon. New, "cool" languages
                    such as Kotlin and Rust barely hit 300 books for the same
                    search query, Jansen said, while Fortran is still evolving,
                    with the latest ISO definition for the language published in
                    2023.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The main reason for Fortran's resurgence, however, is
                    its aptitude for mathematical computing. Fortran has some
                    competition, but each newer language has its own issues.
                    Python is slow, MATLAB is "very easy" for math-related
                    computations but costly, and C/C++ are fast but lack native
                    support for complex math. In this jungle of languages,
                    Jansen said, Fortran still has a reason to exist.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for Cobol, its popularity is even easier to understand.
                    The English-like language was designed for business use in
                    1959 and is now the 20th most popular programming
                    technology. Cobol is still widely used in mainframe
                    computers employed in critical industries such as banking,
                    automotive, insurance, and more. IBM is proposing an

                    To do this, they allegedly deployed "bait transactions"
                    designed to catch the attention of specialized bots often
                    used to help buyers and sellers find lucrative prospects in
                    the ethereum network. When bots snatched up the bait, their
                    validators seemingly exploited a vulnerability in the
                    process commonly used to structure blocks to alter the
                    transaction by reordering the block to their advantage
                    before adding the block to the blockchain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When victims detected the theft, they tried to request the
                    funds be returned, but the DOJ alleged that the brothers
                    rejected those requests and hid the money instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The brothers' online search history showed that they studied
                    up and "took numerous steps to hide their ill-gotten gains,"
                    the DOJ alleged. These steps included "setting up shell
                    companies and using multiple private cryptocurrency
                    addresses and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges" that
                    specifically did not rely on detailed "know your customer"
                    (KYC) procedures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They also researched the "very crimes charged in the
                    indictment," the DOJ said. Among search terms found in the
                    brothers' history during the planning phase of the alleged
                    scheme were phrases like "how to wash crypto" and "exchanges
                    with no KYC." Later, seemingly attempting to prepare for any
                    legal consequences from the scheme, the brothers allegedly
                    searched for things like "top crypto lawyers," and "money
                    laundering statute of limitations," and "does the United
                    States extradite to [foreign country]."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To uncover the scheme, the special agent in charge, Thomas
                    Fattorusso of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) New
                    York Field Office, said that investigators "simply followed
                    the money."

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last month Dame Victoria Sharp and Mr Justice Johnson
                    dismissed most of Mr Assange's legal arguments but said that
                    unless assurances were given by the US he would be able to
                    bring an appeal on three grounds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These assurances were that Mr Assange would be protected by
                    and allowed to rely on the first amendment – which protects
                    freedom of speech in the US – that he is not "prejudiced at
                    trial" due to his nationality, and that the death penalty is
                    not imposed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Judges later confirmed the US had provided an assurance to
                    the court, however Ms Assange dismissed the promises as
                    "blatant weasel words".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Edward Fitzgerald KC, representing Mr Assange in the latest
                    hearing, accepted a promise that he would not face the death
                    penalty but insisted other assurances provided by the US
                    were "blatantly inadequate".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the issue of whether he would be prejudiced by reason of
                    his nationality or use the first amendment as a defence at
                    trial, Mr Fitzgerald said: "This is not an assurance at all.
                    It assures only that Mr Assange 'may seek to' raise the
                    first amendment."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He added: "What needs to be conclusively removed is the risk
                    that he will be prevented from relying on the first
                    amendment on grounds of nationality."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However James Lewis KC, for the US government, insisted
                    that Mr Assange's conduct was "simply unprotected" by the
                    first amendment.

                Made by Boeing, that might not inspire one with confidence due

                    U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing plans to enter the flying
                    car business in Asia by 2030, looking to tap demand for the
                    fast, short-distance travel the vehicles could provide in
                    the region's traffic-choked cities.

                  <p>
                    [...] The company is developing electric vertical take-off
                    and landing (eVTOL) craft at subsidiary Wisk Aero. The
                    aircraft will adopt autonomous technology, rare among eVTOL
                    craft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The plan is to first obtain certification in the U.S. before
                    expanding into Asia. Details of the Asia business will be
                    finalized in the future, including whether Boeing will sell
                    the aircraft to companies aiming to provide eVTOL
                    transportation services or operate the services itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Boeing is currently selecting its first Asian market,
                    including Japan. In Japan, domestic startup SkyDrive and
                    Germany's Volocopter are scheduled to operate air taxi
                    services at the 2025 Osaka World Expo.

                    Boeing opened a research and development base in Nagoya on
                    Thursday. It first established R&amp;D operations in Japan
                    in 2022 but had been renting space from other companies
                    until now.

                    [...] The single-occupant aircraft was developed by a US
                    company. It measures 4.5 meters wide and 2.6 meters high.
                    [...] Officials said the craft can fly at a maximum speed of
                    about 100 kph. It can stay aloft for approximately 15
                    minutes.

                    Buried under the news from Google I/O this week is one of
                    Google Cloud's biggest blunders ever: Google's Amazon Web
                    Services competitor accidentally deleted a giant customer
                    account for no reason. UniSuper, an Australian pension fund
                    that manages $135 billion worth of funds and has 647,000
                    members, had its entire account wiped out at Google Cloud,
                    including all its backups that were stored on the service.
                    UniSuper thankfully had some backups with a different
                    provider and was able to recover its data, but according to
                    UniSuper's incident log, downtime started May 2, and a full
                    restoration of services didn't happen until May 15.

                  <p>
                    UniSuper's website is now full of must-read admin nightmare
                    fuel about how this all happened. First is

                    posted on May 8 titled "A joint statement from UniSuper CEO
                    Peter Chun, and Google Cloud CEO, Thomas Kurian." This
                    statement reads, "Google Cloud CEO, Thomas Kurian has
                    confirmed that the disruption arose from an unprecedented
                    sequence of events whereby an inadvertent misconfiguration
                    during provisioning of UniSuper's Private Cloud services
                    ultimately resulted in the deletion of UniSuper's Private
                    Cloud subscription. This is an isolated, 'one-of-a-kind
                    occurrence' that has never before occurred with any of
                    Google Cloud's clients globally. This should not have
                    happened. Google Cloud has identified the events that led to
                    this disruption and taken measures to ensure this does not
                    happen again."

                    [...] A June 2023 press release touted UniSuper's big cloud
                    migration to Google, with Sam Cooper, UniSuper's Head of
                    Architecture, saying, "With Google Cloud VMware Engine,
                    migrating to the cloud is streamlined and extremely easy.
                    It's all about efficiencies that help us deliver highly
                    competitive fees for our members."

                      >outage update page</a
                    >, which contains 12 statements as the cloud devs worked
                    through this catastrophe. The first update is May 2 with the
                    ominous statement, "You may be aware of a service disruption
                    affecting UniSuper's systems." UniSuper immediately seemed
                    to have the problem nailed down, saying, "The issue
                    originated from one of our third-party service providers,
                    and we're actively partnering with them to resolve this." On
                    May 3, Google Cloud publicly entered the picture with a
                    joint statement from UniSuper and Google Cloud saying that
                    the outage was not the result of a cyberattack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The joint statement and the outage updates are still
                    not a technical post-mortem of what happened, and it's
                    unclear if we'll get one. Google PR
                    <a
                      href="https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1788531368701346100"

                    >
                    in multiple places it signed off on the statement, but a

                      >great breakdown</a

                      >Daniel Compton</a
                    >
                    points out that the statement is not just vague, it's also
                    full of terminology that doesn't align with Google Cloud
                    products. The imprecise language makes it seem like the
                    statement was written entirely by UniSuper. It would be nice
                    to see a real breakdown of what happened from Google Cloud's
                    perspective, especially when other current or potential
                    customers are going to keep a watchful eye on how Google
                    handles the fallout from this.

                underlying question being about how the tracking is occurring.
                The context is that many libraries use DRM'd mobile phone apps
                to allow limited, temporary access to e-books to the subset of
                patrons willing to install the app to the subset of patrons
                willing to agree to the app's terms of service to the subset of
                patrons with smart phones.

                    In December, 2023, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
                    information sciences professor Masooda Bashir led a study
                    titled "Patron Privacy Protections in Public Libraries" that
                    was published in The Library Quarterly. The study found that
                    while libraries generally have basic privacy protections,
                    there are often gaps in staff training and in privacy
                    disclosures made available to patrons.

                  <p>
                    It also found that some libraries rely exclusively on social
                    media for their online presence. "That is very troubling,"
                    said Bashir in

                The assertion is that this level of tracking is not supposed to
                happen with library services, as per professional decisions by
                earlier generations of librarians. The terms of service and
                licensing which both the libraries and their patrons gave the
                nod to may even explicitly allow the surveillance and warn of it
                buried in scores of pages of legalese. Be that as it may, the
                apps creators (and the purchasers, the libraries) may even be
                unknowingly affected by

                patrons have become so unversed in mobile ICT as to buy and
                deploy such DRMed software-as-a-service, which contain two kinds
                of violations of basic rights: digital restrictions and
                tracking. Academic librarian, Dorothea Salo, is off to a good
                start in mitigating the problems but there is a lot to catch up
                on.

                    Personal computing has changed a lot in the past four
                    decades, and one of the biggest changes, perhaps the most
                    unheralded, comes down to compatibility. These days, you
                    generally can't fry a computer by plugging in a joystick
                    that the computer doesn't support. Simply put,
                    standardization slowly fixed this. One of the best examples
                    of a bedrock standard is the peripheral component
                    interconnect, or PCI, which came about in the early 1990s
                    and appeared in some of the decade's earliest consumer
                    machines three decades ago this year. To this day, PCI slots
                    are used to connect network cards, sound cards, disc
                    controllers, and other peripherals to computer motherboards
                    via a bus that carries data and control signals. PCI's
                    lessons gradually shaped other standards, like USB, and
                    ultimately made computers less frustrating. So how did we
                    get it? Through a moment of canny deception.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] So how did we end up with the standards that we have
                    today, and the PCI expansion card standard specifically? PCI
                    wasn't the only game in town—you could argue, for example,
                    that if things played out differently,

                    haul, far beyond other competing standards of its era.

                  <p>
                    Who's responsible for spearheading this standard? Intel.
                    While PCI was a cross-platform technology, it proved to be
                    an important strategy for the chipmaker to consolidate its
                    power over the PC market at a time when IBM had taken its

                    North Korea laundered $147.5 million through virtual
                    currency platform Tornado Cash in March after stealing it
                    last year from a cryptocurrency exchange, according to
                    confidential work by United Nations sanctions monitors seen
                    by Reuters on Tuesday.

                  <p>
                    The monitors told a U.N. Security Council sanctions
                    committee in a document submitted on Friday that they had
                    been investigating 97 suspected North Korean cyberattacks on
                    cryptocurrency companies between 2017 and 2024, valued at
                    some $3.6 billion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That included an attack late last year where $147.5 million
                    was stolen from HTX cryptocurrency exchange before being
                    laundered in March this year, the monitors told the
                    committee, citing information from crypto analytics firm
                    PeckShield and blockchain research firm Elliptic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2024 alone, the monitors said they had been looking at
                    "11 cryptocurrency thefts ... valued at $54.7 million,"
                    adding that many of those "may have been conducted by DPRK
                    IT workers inadvertently hired by small crypto-related
                    companies."

                    The monitors said that according to U.N. member states and
                    private companies, North Korean IT workers operating abroad
                    generate "substantial income for the country."

                    to the committee did not go through that process.

                  <p>
                    The monitors said they had been investigating a Feb. 6 New
                    York Times report that Russia released $9 million out of $30
                    million in frozen North Korean assets and allowed Pyongyang
                    to open an account at a Russian bank in South Ossetia so it
                    could better obtain access to international banking
                    networks.

                    In fact, we're a lot closer to big breakthroughs when it
                    comes to chasing immortality. Ramakrishnan noted the field
                    is moving so fast that a book like his can capture but a
                    snippet. He then took the audience on a brief tour of some
                    of the major directions of aging research. And much of it,
                    he said, started in unexpected places.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While researching the book, he took pains to avoid
                    interviewing scientists with commercial ventures tied to
                    aging.
                  </p>
                  <p>The potential for conflicts of interest abound.</p>
                  <p>
                    The world has seen an explosion in aging research in recent
                    decades, with billions of dollars spent by government
                    agencies and private companies. And the consumer market for
                    products is forecast to hit $93 billion by 2027.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result, false or exaggerated claims by companies
                    promising longer life are currently on the rise,
                    Ramakrishnan noted. He shared one example: Supplements
                    designed to lengthen a person's telomeres, or genetic
                    segments that shrink with age, are available on Amazon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Of course, these are not FDA approved. There are no
                    clinical trials, and it's not clear what their basis is," he
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>But still there appears to be some demand.</p>

                    The US Department of Justice yesterday said it has
                    determined that Boeing violated a 2021 agreement spurred by
                    two fatal crashes and is now facing a potential criminal
                    prosecution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Boeing violated the agreement "by failing to design,
                    implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to
                    prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws
                    throughout its operations," the DOJ said in a

                    in US District Court for the Northern District of Texas.
                    Because of this, "Boeing is subject to prosecution by the
                    United States for any federal criminal violation of which
                    the United States has knowledge," the DOJ said.

                  <p>
                    The US government is still determining whether to initiate a
                    prosecution and said it will make a decision by July 7.
                    Under terms of the 2021 agreement, Boeing has 30 days to
                    respond to the government's notice.

                    [...] "We believe that we have honored the terms of that
                    agreement and look forward to the opportunity to respond to
                    the Department on this issue," Boeing said. "As we do so, we
                    will engage with the Department with the utmost
                    transparency, as we have throughout the entire term of the
                    agreement, including in response to their questions
                    following the Alaska Airlines 1282 accident."

                    Yesterday's DOJ court filing said that Boeing could be
                    prosecuted for the charge listed in the

                    that was filed at the same time as the deferred prosecution
                    agreement in 2021. That document alleged that Boeing
                    defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration in connection
                    with the agency's evaluation of the Boeing 737 Max. The DOJ
                    filing yesterday said Boeing could also be prosecuted for
                    other offenses.

                    This occurred after 346 passengers died in two Boeing 737
                    Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
                    Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion, including $1.77 billion

                    The Federal Trade Commission's Office of Technology has
                    issued a warning to automakers that sell connected cars.
                    Companies that offer such products "do not have the free
                    license to monetize people's information beyond purposes

                    saw a very concrete misuse of connected car data. Writing
                    for The New York Times, Kash Hill learned that owners of
                    connected vehicles made by General Motors had been
                    unwittingly enrolled in OnStar's Smart Driver program

                    [...] The FTC says that automakers and other businesses must
                    protect users' data against illegal collection, use, and
                    disclosure. It points to recent enforcement actions against
                    companies in other sectors that have illegally collected or
                    used geolocation data, surreptitiously disclosed sensitive
                    user data, and illegally used sensitive data for automated
                    decisions.

                    The FTC says the easiest way to comply is to not collect the

                    This week the European Space Agency posted a slightly
                    ominous note regarding its BepiColombo spacecraft, which
                    consists of two orbiters bound for Mercury.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    <a
                      href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Operations/Glitch_on_BepiColombo_work_ongoing_to_restore_spacecraft_to_full_thrust"
                      >online news release</a
                    >
                    cited a "glitch" with the spacecraft that is impairing its
                    ability to generate thrust. The problem was first noted on
                    April 26, when the spacecraft's primary propulsion system
                    was scheduled to undertake an orbital maneuver. Not enough
                    electrical power was delivered to the solar-electric
                    propulsion system at the time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the space agency, a team involving its own
                    engineers and those of its industrial partners began working
                    on the issue. By May 7 they had made some progress,
                    restoring the spacecraft's thrust to about 90 percent of its
                    original level. But this is not full thrust, and the root
                    cause of the problem is still poorly understood.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The spacecraft consists of three components. The
                    "transfer module" is where the current problems are
                    occurring. It was built by the European Space Agency and is
                    intended to power the other two components of the spacecraft
                    until October 2025. It is essential for positioning the
                    spacecraft for entry into orbit around Mercury. The other
                    two elements of the mission are a European orbiter, MPO, and
                    a Japanese orbiter, Mio. After their planned arrival in
                    orbit around Mercury in December 2025, the two orbiters will
                    separate and make at least one year's worth of observations,
                    including the characterization of the small planet's
                    magnetic field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The news release is ambiguous about the fate of BepiColombo
                    if full power cannot be restored to its propulsion system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] What is clear, she said, is that the current thrust
                    level can support the next critical milestone, BepiColombo's
                    fourth Mercury swing-by, which is due to occur on September
                    5 of this year. This is the first of three swing-bys
                    scheduled to happen in rapid succession from September to
                    January that will slow the spacecraft down relative to
                    Mercury.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This swing-by sequence provides a braking delta-V of 2.4
                    km/s and provides a change of velocity vector direction with
                    respect to the Sun as required for the trajectory end game
                    in 2025," Montagnon said.

                    Fossil fuel companies have been especially touchy about
                    shareholder resolutions calling on them to take firmer
                    action on global warming and to be more transparent about
                    the effects their products have on climate.

                    In part that may be the result of some significant victories
                    by activist shareholders. In 2021,

                    shareholder vote on any issue. That same year, the activist

                    risk.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Exxon Mobil also subjected the San Diego County community of
                    Imperial Beach to
                    <a
                      href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-10-27/exxon-critics"

                    over the city's participation in a lawsuit aimed at forcing
                    the company and others in the oil industry to pay
                    compensation for the cost of global warming, which stems
                    from the burning of the companies' products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even in that context, Exxon Mobil's campaign against Arjuna
                    and Follow This represents a high-water mark in corporate
                    cynicism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit asserts that the investment funds' proposed
                    resolution violated standards set forth by the Securities
                    and Exchange Commission governing the propriety of such
                    resolutions — it was related to "the company's ordinary
                    business operations" and closely resembled resolutions on
                    similar topics that had failed to exceed threshold votes at
                    the company's 2022 and 2023 annual meetings. Both standards
                    allow a company to block a resolution from the meeting
                    agenda, or proxy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The company maintained that the shareholder groups
                    aimed to "force ExxonMobil to change the nature of its
                    ordinary business or to go out of business entirely."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's flatly untrue. The resolution observed that the
                    company's "cost of capital may substantially increase if it
                    fails to control transition risks by significantly reducing
                    absolute emissions."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That judgment is shared by many institutional investors and
                    government regulators, and points to a path for preserving
                    Exxon Mobil's business prospects, not destroying them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In any case, what Exxon Mobil failed to note is that
                    shareholder resolutions are always advisory — they can't
                    require management to do anything.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In its lawsuit, the company whined about the sheer burden of
                    handling an increase in shareholder resolutions, especially
                    those on fraught topics such as the environment and social
                    issues. Using what it described as an SEC estimate that it
                    costs corporations $150,000 to deal with every submitted
                    resolution, its annual meeting statement calculated that it
                    has spent
                    <a
                      href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24661511/xom-costs.pdf"
                      >$21 million to manage 140 submitted resolutions</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A couple of points about that. First, the SEC didn't
                    estimate that every resolution costs $150,000 to manage. The
                    SEC actually cites
                    <a
                      href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2020/34-89964.pdf"
                      >a range of $20,000 to $150,000 each</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, a quick look at the company's financial statements
                    gives the lie to its claim that shareholder resolutions are
                    some sort of cataclysmic burden. Its statistics applied to
                    the entire 10-year period from 2014 through 2023, not just a
                    single year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over that decade, Exxon Mobil reported total profits of
                    $204.3 billion. In other words, processing those 140
                    proposals — using the SEC's highest estimate to arrive at
                    $21 million — cost Exxon Mobil one one-hundredth of a
                    percent of its profits, <i>at most</i>, to deal with
                    shareholder proposals.

                    A large international team of physicists working on the BES
                    III collaboration has announced possible physical evidence
                    of glueballs. In their
                    <a
                      href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.181901"
                      >study</a
                    >, published in the journal <i>Physical Review Letters</i>,
                    the group analyzed decaying particles in a particle collider
                    and uncovered what they believe to be evidence of glueballs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Glueballs are theoretical interactions that can occur
                    between gluons, which are carriers of the strong nuclear
                    force. Up until this latest research, it was not known if
                    such theories were correct.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gluons are subatomic particles that are believed to hold
                    quarks together. Quarks are also subatomic particles; they
                    form the nuclei of protons. Mesons are also made from
                    quarks, or more specifically, one quark and one antiquark.
                    Because gluons carry the strong nuclear force, they are able
                    to interact with quarks and other gluons. Due to this latter
                    characteristic, researchers have suggested that gluons could
                    form a kind of particle without involving quarks. The result
                    would be a glueball.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For this new study, the research team was looking for
                    evidence of glueballs. To do so, they forced mesons to
                    collide at high speeds at the Beijing Electron-Positron
                    Collider, located at the Institute of High Energy Physics in
                    Beijing, China. They then studied the resulting debris
                    field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More specifically, they looked for and measured rare
                    combinations of proton/antiprotons in the debris field—prior
                    work using the same collider had found evidence of these.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers were able to analyze 10 billion samples
                    generated over the past decade, and they found evidence of
                    particles with an average mass of 2,395 MeV/c2, which
                    matches what theory has suggested for glueballs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For now, they have named the particle X(2370) based on the
                    mass of the original particles observed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research team acknowledges that their findings are not
                    absolute proof of the existence of glueballs—other
                    interactions, they note, could have led to similar findings.
                    Thus, more work is required before a consensus can be
                    reached.

                    The "California Stop," also known as the "California Roll,"
                    is the act of not coming to a full and complete stop at a
                    stop sign. Whatever it's called where you live, it's illegal
                    and can get you a $200+ ticket and can land you in hot water
                    with your driving record when it's issued by an agency with
                    authority. One California agency however, with no type of
                    traffic authority has been issuing thousands of rolling stop
                    tickets by secretly recording drivers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    KTLA reports that California's Mountains Recreation and
                    Conservation Authority issues around 17,000 rolling stop
                    tickets each year, bringing in over $1.1 million in revenue
                    annually. What exactly is the Mountains Recreation and
                    Conservation Authority? According to the agencies site, it's
                    described as "a local public agency dedicated to the
                    acquisition, preservation and protection of open space,
                    wildlife habitat, and urban, mountain and river parkland
                    that is easily accessible to the public."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The problem with these tickets — aside from being
                    issued by a state park agency with no real authority to
                    issue them — is that they're technically not citations. It
                    seems their sole purpose is to bring in revenue for the MRCA
                    as one Prius driver who was ticketed discovered. "They're
                    engaged in a deceptive practice of pretending to enforce the
                    motor vehicle code when they don't have the authority to do
                    that, and they're tricking people into paying these
                    tickets," they told KTLA.

                very expensive contracts to carry live sports. However, some
                Disney-owned channels like Freeform were permanently removed
                from Charter's lineup, which was notable because content
                providers often insist that distributors like Charter agree to
                carry all of their channels. Although this didn't resolve many
                of the underlying issues like the lack of profitability of
                streaming platforms, the decline of cable TV, or the massive
                contracts for the rights to carry sports, it set a precedent of
                bundling streaming services with cable TV packages.

                    But as obsolete as its technology may seem, the floppy disk
                    is still used today. For example, industrial embroidery
                    machines from the 1990s were built to read patterns and
                    designs from floppy disks. Some older industrial machines
                    and equipment, like computer numerical control (CNC)
                    machines, still use floppy disks to load software updates
                    and programs.

                    Some older Boeing 747 models still use floppy disks to load
                    critical navigation database updates and software into their
                    avionics systems. Indeed, Tom Persky, the president of

                    unstable to be left on, so every morning, in goes the disk,
                    and off goes the trains. It will be replaced, though…

                    Floppy drives also live on in medical devices such as CT

                    off this mortal coil, someone, somewhere, will still be

                    The 8085 microprocessor has two undocumented status flags: V
                    and K. These flags can be reverse-engineered by looking at
                    the silicon of the chip, and their function turns out to be
                    different from previous explanations. In addition, the
                    implementation of these flags shows that they were
                    deliberately implemented, which raises the question of why
                    there [sic] were not documented or supported by Intel.
                    Finally, examining how these flag circuits were implemented
                    in silicon provides an interesting look at how
                    microprocessors are physically implemented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like most microprocessors, the 8085 has a flag register that
                    holds status information on the results of an operation. The
                    flag register is 8 bits: bit 0 holds the carry flag, bit 2
                    holds the parity, bit 3 is always 0, bit 4 holds the
                    half-carry, bit 6 holds the zero status, and bit 7 holds the
                    sign. But what about the missing bits: 1 and 5?

                payments, the government said. "These emails demonstrate that it
                was McClain, acting as Madigan's agent, who dictated the payment

                  <p>
                    There’s no new trailer, and GTA publisher, Take-Two, is not
                    quite ready to offer a specific release date. CEO Strauss
                    Zelnick told <em>Variety</em>: “I think we’re going to leave
                    it there for now.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The sixth mainline installment will be set in Leonida
                    (Rockstar’s Florida equivalent) and focused mostly on Vice
                    City (Miami). Compared to <em>GTA Vice City</em>, however,
                    it’ll be contemporary. So, I’m banking on OnlyFans
                    pastiches, vapes, self-driving cars and everything else
                    2020s. Plus explosions and crime.

                    Contractors curious about an extension cord on the roof of a
                    Michigan grocery store made a startling discovery: A
                    34-year-old woman was living inside the business sign, with
                    enough space for a computer, printer and coffee maker,
                    police said.

                  <p>
                    "She was homeless," Officer Brennon Warren of the Midland
                    Police Department said Thursday. "It's a story that makes
                    you scratch your head, just somebody living up in a sign."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The woman, whose name was not released, told police she had
                    a job elsewhere but had been living inside the Family Fare
                    sign for roughly a year, Warren said. She was found April
                    23.

                  <p>
                    Midland, best known as the global home of Dow Inc., is 130
                    miles (209 kilometers) north of Detroit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Family Fare store is in a retail strip with a
                    triangle-shaped sign at the top of the building. The sign
                    structure, probably 5 feet (1.5 meter) wide and 8 feet (2.4
                    meters) high, has a door and is accessible from the roof,
                    Warren said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There was some flooring that was laid down. A mini desk,"
                    he said. "Her clothing. A Keurig coffee maker. A printer and
                    a computer — things you'd have in your home."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The woman was able to get electricity through a power cord
                    plugged into an outlet on the roof, Warren said.

                    The insurance turmoil caused by climate change — which had
                    been concentrated in Florida, California and Louisiana — is
                    fast becoming a contagion, spreading to states like Iowa,
                    Arkansas, Ohio, Utah and Washington. Even in the Northeast,
                    where homeowners insurance was still generally profitable
                    last year, the trends are worsening.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2023, insurers lost money on homeowners coverage in 18
                    states, more than a third of the country, according to a New
                    York Times analysis of newly available financial data.
                    That's up from 12 states five years ago, and eight states in
                    2013. The result is that insurance companies are raising
                    premiums by as much as 50 percent or more, cutting back on
                    coverage or leaving entire states altogether. Nationally,
                    over the last decade, insurers paid out more in claims than
                    they received in premiums, according to the ratings firm
                    Moody's, and those losses are increasing.

                    [...] The turmoil in insurance markets is a flashing red
                    light for an American economy that is built on real
                    property. Without insurance, banks won't issue a mortgage;
                    without a mortgage, most people can't buy a home. With fewer
                    buyers, real estate values are likely to decline, along with
                    property tax revenues, leaving communities with less money
                    for schools, police and other basic services.

                Have you changed to higher deductible homeowner's insurance to
                effectively "co-insure" your house, while saving on the premium?
                If you are unable to buy insurance at all, are you prepared to
                self-insure, accepting all the financial risk--or is this even
                possible if your bank still holds a significant mortgage?

                    But Comcast's announcement hints at déjà vu as Comcast
                    blatantly seeks to re-create the cable bundle or triple-play
                    package using the very streaming services that are eating
                    away at Comcast's cable business. Ironically, Comcast is
                    seeking to bandage a declining business by feeding some of
                    the biggest contributors to that decline, using the same
                    tactics that drove many customers away in the first place.

                    Under growth strategy, we get the eye-watering figure of
                    $21.2 billion for Raspberry Pi's Total Addressable Market
                    (TAM) in 2023. The TAM is used to reference the revenue
                    opportunities available to a product or service. $16.3
                    billion of the TAM is for industrial and embedded markets —
                    of which $11.6 billion (2023) is for the SBC market — but
                    this is expected to grow by 10% in 2024.

                    The enthusiast and education markets are the "heart" of the

                    billion in 2021. These markets make up a portion of the $29
                    billion global maker market and $6.8 billion global STEM kit
                    market. Raspberry Pi is a popular product in the United
                    States, China, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom.
                    Further growth is expected in these markets.

                  <p>
                    A while back, we talked about the frequency domain: a clever
                    reinterpretation of everyday signals that translates them
                    into the amplitudes of constituent waveforms. The most
                    common basis for this operation are sine waves running at
                    increasing frequencies, but countless other waveforms can be
                    used to create a number of alternative frequency domains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In that earlier article, I also noted two important
                    properties of frequency domain transforms. First, they are
                    reversible: you can recover the original ("time domain" or
                    "spatial domain") data from its frequency image. Second, the
                    transforms have input-output symmetry: the same mathematical
                    operation is used to go both ways. In effect, we have a
                    lever that takes us to a mirror dimension and back. Which of
                    the lever positions is called home is a matter of habit, not
                    math.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, in real life, the distinction matters — and it's
                    particularly important for compression. If you take an
                    image, convert it to the frequency-domain representation,
                    and then reduce the precision of (or outright obliterate!)
                    the high-frequency components, the resulting image still
                    looks perceptually the same — but you now have much less
                    data to transmit or store:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This makes you wonder: if the frequency-domain
                    representation of a typical image looks like diffuse noise,
                    if most of it is perceptually unimportant, and if the
                    transform is just a lever that takes us back and forth
                    between two functionally-equivalent dimensions... could we
                    start calling that mirror dimension home and move some stuff
                    in?
