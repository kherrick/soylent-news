                    The remotely operated vehicle (ROV) found the tail cone of
                    the Titan on the sea floor about 1,600 feet away from the
                    bow of the Titanic and other debris nearby, according to
                    Rear Adm. John Mauger, the First Coast Guard District

                    Debris found on the sea floor was "consistent with the

                "Grambank is like a DNA code of languages," she said. "We can
                use it to make comparisons to build language trees or examine
                how languages that split from a common ancestor differ from each
                other. We can identify features that are very rare in languages
                across the globe and figure out which of those features are
                particularly associated with endangered languages."
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] "Once linguistic diversity is lost, it's not easily
                recovered," said Bowern, a historical linguist whose work
                focuses on language change and language documentation in
                Indigenous Australia. [...]
              </p>
              <p>
                The analysis also revealed that there is a lot more variation
                across languages than was widely believed and provides important
                insights into how languages evolve and diversify. For example,
                the researchers show that genealogy — the gradual changing and
                splitting of languages over time — plays a larger role in
                shaping linguistic diversity than does geography, through which
                languages borrow words and grammatical constructs via contact
                between people speaking different languages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Grambank's developers hope that other researchers will began to
                use the database to discover new patterns in linguistic
                diversity, Bowern said.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    ChatGPT may be well on its way to remaking the internet, but
                    you know where there isn't enough generative AI? On the
                    roads. Microsoft and Mercedes have announced a partnership
                    to test the integration of
                    <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/tag/chatgpt"
                      >ChatGPT</a
                    >
                    with Mercedes vehicles. The feature will launch in beta on
                    more than 900,000 vehicles in the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like most high-end carmakers, Mercedes has spent the last
                    few years developing bespoke vehicle technology. For
                    example, the company has its own Hey Mercedes voice
                    assistant, where ChatGPT will connect. Instead of reaching
                    out to the Mercedes AI model to understand spoken words, the
                    beta software will use ChatGPT to interpret what's said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft and Mercedes contend that using ChatGPT with Hey
                    Mercedes will make the system more reliable and expand its
                    capabilities. Most voice assistants, Hey Mercedes included,
                    are limited in what they can do and understand. You might
                    use a phrase that a person would interpret immediately that
                    flummoxes the AI. ChatGPT is much better at understanding
                    commands, and its grasp of context will allow drivers to
                    have multi-part conversations with the AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mercedes won't have to make any changes or updates to
                    cars to test ChatGPT. That's good because it's not fully
                    committed. Starting today, Mercedes will test ChatGPT for
                    three months. Drivers will be able to opt into the test from
                    the Mercedes app or from the car itself. Just say, "Hey
                    Mercedes, I want to join the beta program." Mercedes hasn't
                    explained what it plans to do after the test, but the press
                    release speaks vaguely about how beta findings could improve
                    future implementations of voice models and AI in Mercedes
                    vehicles.

                    Maryland is already famous for its crabs — but researchers
                    at the University of Maryland are looking to give that
                    distinction an entirely different meaning.

                    the company will have 28 outlets in the U.S. across 19 U.S.
                    states, ranging from California in the west to New York, New

                    [...] Founded in Columbus, Ohio in 1979, Micro Center is a
                    favorite shopping destination for anyone who builds PCs,
                    tinkers with Raspberry Pis or does any kind of 3D printing.
                    The company stocks more than 400 types of filament, along
                    with 3D printers and accessories from major vendors such as
                    Creality and AnyCubic. It's also one of the few places where
                    you can buy Raspberry Pi boards at MSRP, provided that they
                    are in stock.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unlike Best Buy, Amazon and Newegg, Micro Center's business
                    model revolves pretty-much exclusively around getting
                    customers to come into the store. Most of the products are
                    not available for purchase online, though you can reserve
                    them for in-store pickup.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Micro Center is also one of the few places you can actually
                    see and touch high-end peripherals and components. The
                    stores stock well over 150 different gaming keyboards from
                    brands such as Razer, Corsair and Asus. They also have about
                    the same number of PC cases, including those from Lian Li,
                    Fractal Design and NZXT. The Fractal Design North, our
                    current pick for best PC case, is available to see and buy
                    with all of its wood-paneled glory.

                    The lawsuit notes that the biggest social media firms –
                    TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat – have
                    entered into licensing agreements with the publishers and
                    other rights holders that compensate artists for the use of
                    their works on the platforms. Twitter, on the other hand,
                    has no such agreement in place, giving it an "unfair
                    advantage" over rivals. The company has been in talks since
                    2021 to license the music, but they stalled over the $100
                    million price and have stopped entirely since Musk took
                    control.

                    [...] The publishers say that by hosting music without a
                    license, users can listen to the songs on the platform
                    rather than paying for a streaming service, using an
                    ad-supported social media site, or just buying the music
                    outright themselves.

                    Twitter has gained a reputation for moving at a glacial pace
                    when it comes to removing copyrighted material - on those
                    occasions that it does. The Super Mario Bros movie was
                    available on the site for 2 days while it was still in
                    theaters, receiving 10 million views during that time.

                  <p>
                    The suit also seeks a permanent injunction stopping Twitter
                    from infringing the publishers' copyrighted materials.

                    Increasing the photonic crystal lasers' size and brightness
                    did not come without challenges. Specifically, semiconductor
                    lasers encounter problems when their emission area is
                    expanded. A larger lasing area means there is room for light
                    to oscillate in the direction of emission as well as
                    laterally.

                    [...] Noda explains that the next steps are to continue
                    scaling up the diameter of the laser from 3 to 10 mm, a size
                    that could produce 1 kilowatt of output power—although the
                    goal could also be reached using an array of 3-mm PCSELs. He
                    expects that the same technology that led to the 3-mm
                    devices could be used to scale up to 10 mm. "The same design
                    is enough," Noda says.

                    In partnership with the University of Toronto, Aurora
                    Innovation has publicly released the Aurora Multi-Sensor
                    Dataset, a large-scale multi-sensor data set with
                    localization ground truth. The data set consists of rich
                    metadata which includes semantic segmentation and a variety
                    of weather patterns such as rain, snow, overcast cloud and
                    sunshine, in addition to different times of day and varying
                    traffic conditions.<br />[...]<br />By releasing the data
                    set to the academic sector, Aurora aims to contribute
                    "meaningful engineering research and development" to support
                    progress within the autonomous systems field. Additionally,
                    due to the size and the diversity of Aurora's Multi-Sensor
                    Datatset, it can be used for 3D reconstruction, HD map
                    construction, map compression and more.

                    The data set was captured by Uber Advanced Technologies
                    Group (ATG) in the metropolitan area of Pittsburgh, USA
                    between January 2017 and February 2018. Aurora acquired the
                    data set in January 2021. Uber ATG used a 64-beam Velodyne
                    HDL-64E lidar sensor and seven 1920×1200-pixel resolution
                    cameras, in addition to a forward-facing stereo pair and
                    five wide-angle lenses providing a 360-degree view around
                    the vehicle to capture the data.

                It's Pittsburgh, they have below freezing temps, the roads
                develop potholes, construction changes the roads and so on. My
                guess, while this dataset is large and rich, by now it's also
                less than accurate. Still, better than nothing for grant-starved
                university researchers.

                    What do you do when US sanctions prevent the purchase of
                    high-performance Nvidia AI GPUs? In China, universities and

                    their high-performance AI-focused GPUs to the country (and
                    Russia), a restriction aimed at preventing the US companies'
                    top hardware from being used by or diverted to military
                    users and finding their way into the nation's

                    The sanctions mean that China cannot import Nvidia A100 or
                    H100 GPUs, while AMD's MI250 Instinct card is also
                    prohibited, leaving less powerful options such as the MI100

                  <p>
                    Reuters visited the famous Huaqiangbei electronics area in
                    the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen where two vendors told
                    reporters they could provide small numbers of A100 chips for
                    $20,000 each, double the usual price of around $10,000.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Hong Kong startup founder said he experienced the same
                    thing when quoted $19,150 each for two to four A100 cards,
                    which were needed to run its latest AI models. In addition
                    to paying much more than their MSRP, these cards lack any
                    kind of warranty or support.

              <p>
                I have seen most of the open letters and comments. There's a lot
                to cover, and honestly, a large post on the main page isn't a
                good way to do this. However, I will address the largest
                recurring theme, which is fear that people believe that the PBC
                is going to sell people's personal data, or otherwise harvest it
                beyond what we have.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PBC was specifically founded to keep SN as an independent
                entity so we wouldn't end up under another DICE-like entity.
                Slashdot changed legal owners many times over the years both in
                an effort to make it profitable through the .com era, and in
                later years, as a showcase for advertors to spend money on. From
                what I can tell, a lot of people fear that SoylentNews will
                essentially become what Slashdot Media
                (https://slashdotmedia.com/) is today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let me address this one right now. That isn't what is happening
                here.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now, Matt and I have officially held the meeting and did
                the paperwork to have kolie installed as COO as an officer of
                the PBC. He can speak on behalf of the company officially. Along
                those lines, we are determined to seek one or more qualified
                candidates to serve on the Board, with the goal of nominating at
                least one such candidate to the board no later than July 31,
                2023. The big news is - your voice is being represented - throw
                in your hat if you want to participate.
              </p>
              <p>
                At which point, we're going to take advantage of some foresight
                that we did 9 years ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                SoylentNews's public benefit corporations bylaws specifically
                allow for a business meeting to be held over IRC. So, at some
                point somewhat soon, we're going to host a formal meeting where
                the board (likely represented by me and kolie) will sit, and
                answer questions. An open form for questions will be posted,
                which will be consolidated down, and answered to the best of our
                ability.
              </p>
              <p>
                The specifics of that are TBD, but I expect to open the floor in
                early July, and leave the questions period open for a week or
                so. We will then edit the list down, contact each person who
                wishes to present, post what we are covering, and then schedule
                the meeting on IRC. That's probably going to be a lot of back
                and forth.
              </p>
              <p>
                The large shape of things I expect to come is going to be having
                the community much more directly involved in the business side,
                but that's going to likely require amending the bylaws, as well
                as having a specific written process of who is eligible, and all
                the paperwork that goes with.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am semi-expecting we're going to have to discuss aspects of
                this with legal assistance simply to determine what is and isn't
                possible under Delaware business law for a public benefit
                corporation.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is also the major step that will let me step out of the
                role of president of the PBC, and at the end of it, allow me to
                finally be able to step away, since there will be someone I can
                hand the role over to who will have legal responsibility for the
                site, and the knowledge that SN will not become DICEdot 2.0.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the honest truth is that while I am happy that SN
                appears to have a chance at continuing, and many of the very
                long standing issues being resolved, the personal cost to myself
                has been immense, especially in light of everything that has
                transpired.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's an ongoing discussion as to what my exit from the site
                is going to look like when the changing of the guard is
                complete. Right now, for that to happen, all the steps I just
                outlined, and then have to be accomplished, but I can at least
                say things are moving. Perhaps not as fast as we all would like,
                but they're moving.
              </p>

                EDIT: There was supposed to be a more firm commitment on when
                the board will be expanded in the original post that got lost
                due to multiple edits before this went live and got left out on
                the final version until I re-read it.

                  <p>Reddit’s month may be going from bad to worse.</p>
                  <p>
                    Hackers from the BlackCat ransomware gang, also known as
                    ALPHV, are threatening to leak 80 gigabytes of confidential
                    data from Reddit that they claim to have stolen during a
                    February breach, according to a post from the group on the
                    dark web, which was reviewed by CNN and an independent
                    cybersecurity expert.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In their post, the hackers claim they first demanded a
                    US$4.5 million payout “for the deletion of the data and our
                    silence” in April. After receiving no response, the group
                    said it followed up on Friday with an additional demand:
                    Reddit should withdraw a controversial new pricing policy
                    that has sparked a protest from some of the platform’s most
                    influential users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We are very confident that Reddit will not pay for
                    its data," the group wrote in the post on the dark web. "We
                    expect to leak the data."

                    and said that it wants to be profitable. He also suggested
                    that these protests were spearheaded by a “small group
                    that’s very upset” and it didn’t have any impact on the
                    company’s revenues. Through these public votes, communities
                    are trying to prove that a large number of people are
                    unhappy with the changes made by Reddit.

                    Privacy and security features that aim to give consumers
                    more control over the sharing of their data by smartphone
                    apps are widely misunderstood, shows new research from the
                    University of Bath's
                    <a

                  <p>
                    43 per cent of phone users in the study were confused or
                    unclear about what app tracking means. People commonly
                    mistook the purpose of tracking, thinking that it was
                    intrinsic to the app function, or that it would provide a
                    better user experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    App tracking is used by companies to deliver targeted
                    advertising to smartphone users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The most common misapprehension (24 per cent) was that
                    tracking refers to sharing the physical location of the
                    device - rather than tracing the use of apps and websites.
                    People thought they needed to accept tracking for food
                    delivery and collection services, such as Deliveroo, or for
                    health and fitness apps, because they believed their
                    location was integral to the functioning of the app.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While just over half of participants (51 per cent) said they
                    were concerned about privacy or security – including
                    security of their data after it had been collected -
                    analysis showed no association between their concern for
                    privacy in their daily life and a lower rate of tracking
                    acceptance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Some of the confusion is likely to be due to lack of
                    clarity in wording chosen by companies in the tracking
                    prompts, which are easy to misinterpret. For example, when
                    ASOS said 'We'll use your data to give you a more
                    personalised ASOS experience and to make our app even more
                    amazing' it's probably no surprise that people thought they
                    were opting for additional functionality rather than just
                    more relevant adverts."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Other misconceptions included believing that
                    consenting to sharing for health apps (such as period
                    tracking apps) would mean private data being shared, or that
                    denying tracking would remove adverts from the app.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "While people are now familiar with the benefits of
                    having PIN numbers and facial recognition to protect our
                    devices, more work needs to be done so people can make
                    transparent decisions about what other data is used for in
                    the digital age."

                    Mehrabi's analysis found that a turning point from farm
                    creation to widespread consolidation will begin to occur as
                    early as 2050 in communities across Asia, the Middle East,
                    North Africa, Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean.
                    Sub-Saharan Africa will follow the same course later in the
                    century, the research found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It also shows that even if the total amount of farmland
                    doesn't change across the globe in coming years, fewer
                    people will own and farm what land there is available. The
                    trend could threaten biodiversity in a time where
                    biodiversity conservation is top of mind.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Larger farms typically have less biodiversity and more
                    monocultures," Mehrabi said. "Smaller farms typically have
                    more biodiversity and crop diversity, which makes them more
                    resilient to pest outbreaks and climate shocks."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And it's not just biodiversity: Food supply is also at risk.
                    Mehrabi's previous research shows the world's smallest farms
                    make up just 25% of the world's agricultural land but
                    harvest one-third of the world's food.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Currently, we have around 600 million farms feeding
                    the world, and they're carrying 8 billion people on their
                    shoulders," Mehrabi said. "By the end of the century, we'll
                    likely have half the number of farmers feeding even more
                    people. We really need to think about how we can have the
                    education and support systems in place to support those
                    farmers."

                    But all this work was ridiculed. Microsoft, through Github,
                    Google and Apple pushed for MIT/BSD licensed software as the
                    open source standard. This allowed them to use open source
                    components within their proprietary closed products. They
                    managed to make thousands of free software developers work
                    freely for them. And they even received praise because,
                    sometimes, they would hire one of those developers (like it
                    was a "favour" to the community while it is simply
                    business-wise to hire smart people working on critical
                    components of your infrastructure instead of letting them
                    work for free). The whole Google Summer of Code, for which I
                    was a mentor multiple years, is just a cheap way to get
                    unpaid volunteers mentor their future free or cheap
                    workforce.

                    Our freedoms were taken away by proprietary software which
                    is mostly coded by ourselves. For free. We spent our free
                    time developing, debugging, testing software before handing
                    them to corporations that we rever, hoping to maybe get a
                    job offer or a small sponsorship from them. Without
                    Non-copyleft Open Source, there would be no proprietary
                    MacOS, OSX nor Android. There would be no Facebook, no
                    Amazon. We created all the components of Frankenstein's
                    creature and handed them to the evil professor.

                    Phonons can't be permanently broken into smaller bits. But,
                    as the new experiment showed, they can be temporarily

                    quantum applications, says Andrew Armour, a physicist at the
                    University of Nottingham in England who was not involved in

                    "It's probably not so clear what those [applications] are at

                    [...] Large language models will get worse if they are
                    increasingly trained on fake content generated by AI
                    collected from crowdsource platforms, the researchers
                    argued. Outfits like OpenAI keep exactly how they train
                    their latest models a close secret, and may not heavily rely
                    on things like Mechanical Turk, if at all. That said, plenty
                    of other models may rely on human workers, which may in turn
                    use bots to generate training data, which is a problem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mechanical Turk, for one, is marketed as a provider of "data
                    labeling solutions to power machine learning models."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Human data is the gold standard, because it is humans that
                    we care about, not large language models," Riberio said. "I
                    wouldn't take a medicine that was only tested in a
                    Drosophila biological model," he said as an example.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Responses generated by today's AI models are usually quite
                    bland or trivial, and do not capture the complexity and
                    diversity of human creativity, the researchers argued.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Sometimes what we want to study with crowdsourced data is
                    precisely the ways in which humans are imperfect," Robert
                    West, co-author of the paper and an assistant professor in
                    the EPFL's school of computer and communication science,
                    told us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As AI continues to improve, it's likely that crowdsourced
                    work will change. Riberio speculated that large language
                    models could replace some workers at specific tasks.
                    "However, paradoxically, human data may be more precious
                    than ever and thus it may be that these platforms will be
                    able to implement ways to prevent large language model usage
                    and ensure it remains a source of human data."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Who knows – maybe humans might even end up collaborating
                    with large language models to generate responses too, he
                    added.

                    burnt power supply connectors when using them with newer
                    high-end GPUs. Upon investigation, the team realized one of

                    submarine that went missing in the North Atlantic on an
                    expedition to explore the wreckage of the Titanic. Lt.
                    Jordan Hart of the U.S. Coast Guard in Boston first
                    confirmed to CBS News that personnel were "currently
                    undergoing a search and rescue operation" when asked about
                    the rescue efforts off the coast of Newfoundland.

                    At a news conference Monday afternoon, Rear Admiral John
                    Mauger confirmed that five people were on board. A Coast
                    Guard official identified them as an operator and four
                    mission specialists — a term the company uses for its
                    passengers.

                    The vessel submerged on a dive Sunday morning, and the crew
                    of the Polar Prince — the ship that ferried the submersible
                    and expedition members to the dive site — "lost contact with
                    them approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes into the vessel's
                    dive," the Coast Guard said in a tweet.

                    [...] Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University,
                    thinks crypto is inherently susceptible to boom-and-boost
                    cycles and manipulation by insiders, and thinks it should be
                    banned. She says the SEC's actions could help re-confine
                    crypto to the realm of tech enthusiasts, given the wider
                    state of the industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If we combine these enforcement actions with waning trust
                    from the public, with possibly waning interest from venture
                    capital, then maybe there isn't a future," she says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Mr Stephens, who has weathered two "crypto winters"
                    already, says he thinks the future remains bright - if at
                    risk of ending up overseas, given America's current
                    approach, which is seen as less friendly than other
                    jurisdictions, including the UK and the EU.

                    He points to Bitcoin's price, which is hovering around 2020
                    levels, but has gained significantly from the start of the
                    year. Ether has also risen.

                    kill the industry. It can absolutely, though, make the
                    crypto industry smaller," she says.

                    The Federal Reserve Board warned member banks that it
                    intends to presumptively prohibit a large portion of
                    cryptocurrency banking activity, as the demand for more
                    guidance over digital assets has grown following rampant
                    instances of fraud.

                      >a final rule</a
                    >
                    published on Tuesday, the Board of Governors of the Federal
                    Reserve System offered an interpretation of section 9(13) of
                    the Federal Reserve Act to govern the use of digital assets
                    within the federal banking ecosystem. That section
                    specifically applies rules set by the Federal Reserve for
                    member banks, dictating the banking activity state
                    depository institutions are legally able to conduct as only
                    that which is also permissible for national banks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Federal Reserve member banks consist of financial
                    institutions at the state level that meet the operational
                    requirements of the Federal Reserve System, and are overseen
                    by the 12 designated regional banks across the U.S.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rule issues two directives pursuant to the Federal
                    Reserve's existing laws: that the Board will "presumptively
                    prohibit" member banks from holding most crypto assets, and
                    that member banks wishing to utilize dollar tokens will need
                    to prove certain security measures and receive formal
                    approval prior to its use in banking transactions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Both rules cite the "significant risks" associated with the
                    cryptocurrency sector, including fraud, legal ambiguity and
                    volatility.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Despite largely concurring that employing digital
                    assets in the U.S. banking system poses security threats,
                    the Board offered some avenues for potential incorporation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The final rule notes that issuing dollar tokens along
                    decentralized ledgers was also likely unsafe. However,
                    member banks are eligible to receive a "supervisory
                    nonobjection" from the Board provided they can demonstrate
                    the ability to conduct safe banking with dollar tokens.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Commonly referred to as stablecoins, dollar denominated
                    tokens differ from traditional cryptocurrencies in that they
                    are pegged to the U.S. dollar, thereby presenting a lower
                    risk in price volatility. Deploying dollar tokens along a
                    distributed ledger software still poses a significant amount
                    of cybersecurity and operation risks, according to the
                    Board, namely among illicit finance activity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The Board generally believes that issuing tokens on open,
                    public and/or decentralized networks or similar systems is
                    highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking
                    practices," it said.

                    -- has been bubbling under the surface for the past few
                    years. Now, it looks like it is ready to take off. The topic
                    has already been debated at this year's World Economic Forum
                    in Switzerland, and <strong>Bank of America</strong>(<a

                      >BAC</a
                    >) just released a report suggesting that central bank
                    digital currencies have the potential to revolutionize the
                    global financial system. According to that report, these
                    digital currencies represent "the most significant
                    technological advancement in the history of money."

                  <p>
                    In many ways, it's a question of when, not if, this
                    transformational change is going to happen. According to the
                    Atlantic Council, 114 nations around the world are exploring
                    the introduction of CBDCs, and 18 of the G20 nations are in
                    the advanced stages of launching one. So, if CBDCs are "the
                    future of money," what does that mean for Bitcoin (<a
                      href="https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/btc/"
                      >BTC</a
                    >)? After all, wasn't Bitcoin supposed to be the future of
                    money?
                  </p>
                  <p>Scenario 1: CBDCs fail to take off</p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For reasons such as these, it's easy to imagine a
                    scenario in which CBDCs never really get off the ground, and
                    Bitcoin emerges as the winner when it comes to digital
                    currencies. In many ways, that was the vision that many
                    people had for
                    <a
                      href="https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/bitcoin/"

                    >
                    at the outset. For more than a decade, crypto enthusiasts
                    have argued that Bitcoin should replace traditional fiat
                    currencies. From this perspective, CBDCs are just
                    reinventing the wheel. If you buy into this narrative, then
                    Bitcoin is a strong long-term buy and hold, because it will
                    be the future of money.
                  </p>
                  <p>Scenario 2: CBDCs and Bitcoin coexist</p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This is probably the most likely scenario, simply
                    because there could be a massive outcry from the private
                    sector if any of today's major financial players -- such as
                    commercial banks -- are disintermediated out of the system.
                    And private citizens might respond quite negatively if they
                    think CBDCs are being used by central banks to gain
                    sensitive information or data about them, such as their
                    precise spending patterns.
                  </p>
                  <p>Scenario 3: CBDCs replace Bitcoin</p>
                  <p>
                    In this scenario, CBDCs become a huge hit, people realize
                    the limitations of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and
                    cash disappears. In this potential future, the past decade
                    will be seen as just a period of experimentation with
                    digital currencies. Historians will say that Bitcoin helped
                    pave the way for national CBDCs, but lament the fact that
                    the original crypto has largely been relegated to the
                    dustbin of history. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>Is Bitcoin the future of money?</p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ultimately, digital currencies have the potential to
                    revolutionize the global financial system, as Bank of
                    America suggests. The only question is who will be the
                    ultimate winners here. Right now, I'm putting my full faith
                    in Bitcoin. Governments are good at many things, but not at
                    financial innovation.

                    This is where IBM's new work comes in. In the experiment,
                    the company's researchers used a 127 qubit IBM Eagle
                    processor to calculate what's known as an Ising model,
                    simulating the behavior of 127 magnetic, quantum-sized
                    particles in a magnetic field — a problem that has
                    real-world value but, at that scale, is far too complicated
                    for classical computers to solve.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To mitigate the quantum noise, the researchers,
                    paradoxically, actually introduced <i>more</i> noise, and
                    then precisely documented its effects on each part of the
                    processor's circuit and the patterns that arose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] From there, the researchers could reliably extrapolate
                    what the calculations would have looked like without noise
                    at all. They call this process "error mitigation."

                  <p>
                    "The level of agreement between the quantum and classical
                    computations on such large problems was pretty surprising to
                    me personally," co-author Andrew Eddins, a physicist at IBM
                    Quantum, said in a lengthy

                    As promising as the findings are, it's "not obvious that
                    they've achieved quantum supremacy here," co-author Michael
                    Zaletel, a UC Berkley physicist, told the <i>NYT</i>.

                    There is a widespread idea that modern high-performance x86
                    processors work by decoding the "complex" x86 instructions
                    into "simple" RISC-like instructions that the rest of the
                    pipeline then operates on. But how close is this idea to how
                    the processors actually work internally?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To answer this question, let's analyze how different x86
                    processors, ranging from the first "modern" Intel
                    microarchitecture, P6, to their current designs, handle the
                    following simple loop (the code is 32-bit just to allow us
                    to discuss very old x86 processors):
                  </p>

                    .loop:<br />
                    add [edx], eax<br />
                    add edx, 4<br />

                    Sunshine levels have a significant impact on the bidding
                    behaviour of stock market investors, according to new
                    research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study examined the relationship between sunny weather
                    and how market participants perform, as well as the
                    subsequent seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). These discounts
                    for shares act as an effective tool for companies to raise
                    finance and are essential for a functioning modern economy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The data revealed investors made higher bids in sunny
                    periods, which led to lower discounts for shares in the
                    primary market. In fact, just a one standard deviation
                    increase in sunshine intensity caused bid discounts to
                    decline by 2.4 percent, while a one standard deviation
                    increase in sunshine duration caused bid discounts to drop
                    by 3.33 percent.

                    Finance at the University of Portsmouth, said: "With sunny
                    weather, often come good spirits – which in many
                    circumstances is a positive, but that's not the case with
                    financial decision-making. When the sunshine intensifies,
                    bidders become overly optimistic and less risk-averse, which
                    can lead to higher bid prices for seasoned equities."

                  <p>
                    Existing research has shown meteorological conditions,
                    especially exposure to sunshine, affects a person's
                    emotional state and sentiment. These weather-driven moods
                    have been proved to influence a buyer's car choice, art
                    prices at auction, and the tendency to take risks in a
                    lottery.

                  <p>
                    [...] Professor Liu added: "We want to make investors aware
                    that during periods of sunny weather, they become more
                    optimistic about their investments. This will make them more
                    inclined to take risks that aren't justified by asset
                    values. Therefore, they should factor this consideration in
                    when bidding for shares or they might suffer losses.

                    "Maintaining the stability of markets could depend upon our
                    understanding of this phenomenon, since the onset of climate
                    change might have an increasingly destabilizing impact on
                    the judgment of investors and market-makers, with
                    unpredictable consequences for global trading."

                    Why do so few female school leavers with good grades in
                    mathematics choose to study a technical subject – despite
                    the high salaries and good employment prospects in the STEM
                    sector? This question has long preoccupied the social
                    sciences, especially as studies show that girls and boys do
                    equally well in mathematics at school.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is possible that socially embedded gender stereotypes
                    play a role, such as: men think logically and in abstract
                    terms, women are more creative; men should be the
                    breadwinners, women take care of the family; men are
                    competitive, women are more risk-averse. A study by Benita
                    Combet from the Department of Sociology at the University of
                    Zurich has now shown that some of these ingrained beliefs do
                    indeed influence people's subject choices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Especially with regard to factors such as logical
                    thinking style and technical skills, strong gender
                    stereotypes still exist, which obviously significantly
                    influence the decisions of female high school students,"
                    says Combet. "We should therefore continue to work on
                    challenging and questioning these fixed beliefs." With
                    regard to analytical thinking, for example, it has by no
                    means been scientifically proven that there are differences
                    between men and women. Moreover, the ability to think
                    analytically is a basic requirement for almost every subject
                    area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Combet also believes schoolchildren should be given better
                    and more detailed information about future subject choices:
                    "Many of their current perceptions are not accurate." For
                    example, many believe that to be good at engineering, all
                    you need is an affinity for technology. In fact, says
                    Combet, "interpersonal and creative skills are also
                    important in engineering, for example working in a team to
                    develop new products."

                [hubie] How often do you extend the life or repurpose retired
                mobile devices and how have you done it? Through advice and
                encouragement I got from the SN community, a few years ago I
                resurrected an old Samsung tablet by installing LineageOS and I
                use it all the time to play games I get off of F-Droid.

                    What's old is new again, at least in the European Union. The
                    European Parliament recently voted in favor of new
                    legislation that would overhaul the entire battery life
                    cycle, from design to end-of-life, which includes important
                    caveats for smartphone users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among the many changes, the new rules would require
                    batteries in consumer devices like smartphones to be easily
                    removable and replaceable. That's far from the case today
                    with most phones, but that wasn't always the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the earlier days of mobile phones (think Nokia 5190,
                    Nokia 3310, Motorola Razr V3, Palm Treo 700p), swapping out
                    the battery took mere seconds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] For phones with "internal" batteries, you'd simply
                    pop off the rear cover of the device, lift the battery out,
                    put a fresh one in, and button it back up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Manufacturers eventually moved away from easily swappable

                    time, most accepted it as the new norm and moved on.

                    [....] This is not the first time the EU has prompted a
                    rethink. Last year, the EU set a deadline of December 28,
                    2024, for phones and other small electronic devices to
                    include a USB-C port for charging. That's a problem for
                    Apple considering the iPhone uses a proprietary Lightning
                    port.

                In that final paragraph, that standard USB-C charging port may
                be a problem for Tesla and other EV charging unless the EV owner
                has a really good USB-C cable.

                    including its main ride-hailing app, food delivery service,
                    and alcohol sales platform Drizly. This ad sale is part of a
                    "key growth area," according to Mark Grether, vice president
                    and general manager of Uber Technologies' advertising

                    Users will start seeing video ads when waiting for their
                    drivers to arrive and even during their trips. For cars that
                    have tablets installed inside, they will also appear there.
                    For the Uber Eats app, video ads will play after customers
                    place orders and continue until their deliveries arrive.
                    Drizly, on its way, will have them in search results on its
                    app and website.

                    WSJ says Grethen praises Uber's ability to "use data based
                    on users' own travel and purchase histories to target them
                    during the critical period between the time they open each
                    app and the time they complete their transactions." He said
                    that a ride usually takes 15 minutes, and 2 of the people
                    are paying attention to the app.

                    are, we know where you are going to, we know what you have
                    eaten," he said. "We can use all of that to then basically
                    target a video ad towards you."

                    The philosophy changed with the Spirit and Opportunity
                    rovers, whose teams started using more intentional names.
                    For instance, the Opportunity team nicknamed a crater
                    "Endurance" to honor the ship that carried explorer Ernest
                    Shackleton's ill-fated expedition to Antarctica. The names
                    for the spots where Curiosity and Perseverance landed honor
                    science-fiction writers Ray Bradbury and Octavia E. Butler,
                    respectively. The InSight team named a rock that had been
                    jostled by the lander's retrorockets during touchdown
                    "Rolling Stones Rock," after the band. And the Curiosity
                    team named a Martian hill after their colleague Rafael
                    Navarro-González, who died from COVID-19 complications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Then, as now, team members suggested ideas for themes
                    based on sites where they have worked or to which they have
                    a personal connection, and they informally discussed which
                    would be the most interesting to include, keeping in mind
                    that various names would be memorialized in future
                    scientific papers. Once a theme is picked, hundreds of names
                    fitting into that theme are compiled. That many are needed
                    because the available names can dwindle quickly, given that
                    Curiosity may stay in a quadrant for several months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Curiosity's latest quadrant, the rover's team chose a
                    theme named after Roraima, the northernmost state of Brazil,
                    and for Mount Roraima, the highest peak in the Pacaraima
                    Mountains, located near the border of Venezuela, Brazil, and
                    Guyana. This marked the first South American quadrant theme.
                    The sulfate-enriched region Curiosity is currently
                    exploring, with its flat-topped hills and steep slopes,
                    reminded them of the "tabletop" mountains in the Pacaraima
                    range.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Perseverance, scientists chose to go with national park
                    themes. The rover is now exploring the Rocky Mountain
                    quadrant and recently drilled into rocks at a location
                    bearing the nickname of Rocky Mountain National Park's
                    "Powell Peak."

                    By pumping water out of the ground and moving it elsewhere,
                    humans have shifted such a large mass of water that the
                    Earth tilted nearly 80 centimeters (31.5 inches) east
                    between 1993 and 2010 alone, according to a new study
                    published in <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i>.

                    humans pumped 2,150 gigatons of groundwater, equivalent to
                    more than 6 millimeters (0.24 inches) of sea level rise,
                    from 1993 to 2010. But validating that estimate is

                    >, and until now, the specific contribution of groundwater
                    to these rotational changes was unexplored. In the new
                    study, researchers modeled the observed changes in the drift
                    of Earth's rotational pole and the movement of water—first,
                    with only ice sheets and glaciers considered, and then
                    adding in different scenarios of groundwater redistribution.

                  <p>
                    The model only matched the observed polar drift once the
                    researchers included 2150 gigatons of groundwater
                    redistribution. Without it, the model was off by 78.5
                    centimeters (31 inches), or 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches) of
                    drift per year.

                    pole drift," [lead study author Ki-Weon] Seo said. "On the
                    other hand, as a resident of Earth and a father, I'm
                    concerned and surprised to see that pumping groundwater is
                    another source of sea-level rise."

                    Since October, dozens of RTX 4090 owners have reported
                    melting power adapter cables. Despite investigations from
                    Nvidia and third parties, a definitive cause has yet to be
                    determined. It was thought that pairing the GPU with an ATX
                    3.0 power supply was a safe solution... until now.

                    A new report of a burnt GeForce RTX 4090 power cable has
                    emerged on Reddit, but this case is fundamentally different
                    from prior incidents. If it's connected to the same flaw, it
                    could cast doubt on earlier theories as to the problem's
                    source.

                    on a 1000W BeQuet Dark Power 13 ATX 3.0 power supply. This
                    case is potentially significant because despite looking
                    similar to previous examples of scorched 4090 cables, it
                    lacks two common factors between the others.

                    since October resulted in damage to the connectors plugged
                    into the graphics card. Furthermore, they all affected
                    customers who used the 4090's bundled 16-pin connection
                    adapters to plug the GPU into an ATX 2.0 power supply's
                    12-pin socket.

                    Shiftyeyes67k bought an ATX 3.0 PSU with a 16-pin socket
                    specifically to avoid this problem. Prior incidents led
                    users to blame the adapter, and upgrading to an ATX 3.0
                    power supply is a small investment compared to the $1,600
                    4090, but this instance involved no adapter. Another owner
                    who reported the problem last month had used a high-end
                    third-party adapter, casting early doubt on Nvidia's

                    Google may soon be ordered to break up its lucrative ad

                    revenue. Today,

                      >as expected</a
                    >, the European Commission (EC) sent Google a statement of
                    objections, detailing ad tech antitrust charges and
                    explaining exactly why the EC thinks that breaking up
                    Google's ad business may be the only acceptable remedy.

                    "We are concerned that Google may have illegally distorted
                    competition in the online advertising technology industry,"
                    Margrethe Vestager, the EC's executive vice president, said
                    in
                    <a
                      href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_23_3288"

                    published today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Vestager, an EC investigation launched in 2021
                    found that Google may have favored its own ad tech services
                    when serving as an intermediary ad exchange, matching
                    advertiser supply and publisher demand for advertising space
                    online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To the EC, it seems like Google has its hand in too many
                    pots to be trusted to conduct business fairly. Google
                    operates an ad exchange, AdX, as well as ad tech services
                    for advertisers—Google Ads and Google Display &amp; Video
                    360 (DV 360)—and services for publishers, DoubleClick For
                    Publishers (DFP).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Vestager said there's potential for misconduct because
                    "Google may hold a dominant position on both ends of the ad
                    tech supply chain" and "appears to have abused its market
                    position" by ensuring that both advertising and publisher
                    services allegedly favored AdX over other ad exchanges when
                    matching advertisers and publishers.

                    For 30 years, mathematicians wondered if you could have an

                    to a unique value, and have those values each be fairly

                    Paul Erdős—one of the most prolific mathematicians of the
                    20th century—posed a question with two components seemingly
                    at odds with one another: Could a Sidon set be an
                    "asymptotic basis of order three?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Named after another Hungarian mathematician, Simon
                    Sidon, these sets are basically a collection of numbers
                    where no two numbers in the set add up to the same integer.
                    For example, in the simple Sidon set (1, 3, 5, 11), when any
                    of the two numbers in the set are added together, they equal
                    a unique number. Constructing a Sidon set with only four
                    numbers is extremely easy, but as the set increases in size,
                    it just gets harder and harder. As soon as two sums are the
                    same, the collection of numbers is no longer considered a
                    Sidon set.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second element of Erdős' problem—that scary-sounding
                    "asymptotic basis of order three" part—means that:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>a set must be infinitely large</li>
                    <li>
                      any large enough integer can be written as the result of
                      adding together at most 3 numbers in the set.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    So, this 30-year-old conundrum centered on whether or not
                    these two elements could exist in the same set of numbers.
                    For decades, the answer seemed to be no.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] So how did Pilatte get a mathematically square peg to
                    fit a seemingly round hole? He took an unconventional
                    approach and turned to

                    >
                    rather than the probabilistic method championed by Erdős and
                    what's called additive number theory. Pilatte replaced
                    numbers with polynomials and made use of the recent work of
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09730"

                    mathematicians. Combining these ideas, Pilatte successfully
                    created a Sidon set dense enough and random enough to
                    finally solve Erdős's original problem.

                  outlines his alleged witnessing of how ByteDance supplies user
                  data to the CCP</a

                    Yintao "Roger" Yu, a former ByteDance executive based in
                    California, filed a lawsuit against his former employer
                    alleging a list of wrongdoings. According to Yu, ByteDance
                    has stolen content from other creators online, discriminated
                    against employees, and inflated its engagement metrics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A striking allegation Yu made against ByteDance has been
                    highly suspected but yet to be proven. Yu alleges that the
                    Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the ruling political party in
                    China, can and has accessed TikTok user data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yu alleges that the CCP uses ByteDance as a political
                    propaganda tool and cites two examples in which he witnessed
                    ByteDance promote or demote content on TikTok that aligned
                    with the CCP's political goals.
                  </p>

                      >According to the court filings</a
                    >, "Mr. Yu observed that ByteDance has been responsive to
                    the CCP's requests to share information, and even to elevate
                    or remove content at the request of the CCP."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yu alleges that ByteDance promoted content that expressed
                    hatred for Japan, and in 2018, ByteDance demoted content
                    that expressed support for political protests in Hong Kong.
                    Yu alleges this was possible in Hong Kong because the CCP
                    monitored activists' locations via backdoor data access.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to Yu's filing, storing US user data on US
                    soil does not mean the CCP cannot access the data, and the
                    only way to ensure China cannot access the data is to shut
                    the backdoor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] TikTok declined to address Yu's allegations, but a
                    ByteDance spokesperson discredited the allegations by
                    mentioning that Yu did not work for TikTok but for
                    Flipagram, another ByteDance-owned app.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ByteDance's spokesperson questioned Yu's intentions by
                    mentioning that Yu was terminated from Flipagram in 2018 and
                    is now coming forward with his allegations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, these allegations are found in a wrongful
                    termination lawsuit and do not supply any further evidence,
                    like internal memos or messages. Yu is the first former
                    ByteDance employee to publicly allege that the relationship
                    between ByteDance and the CCP is too close for comfort.

                    untested rocket or if some serious design and launch flaws
                    doomed it). However, Starship is a double-edged sword,
                    capable of launching big telescopes but also deploying vast
                    numbers of Starlink satellites.

                  <p>
                    Space telescopes were never meant to replace ground-based
                    observatories, nor can they. They work together,
                    complementarily, but we need both. Whatever benefits
                    Starship provides for telescopes, it is literally not the
                    one-size-fits-all solution to the growing Starlink problem.

                    Comcast is not happy about new federal rules that will
                    require it to provide broadband customers with labels

                    will be required to display to consumers at the point of

                    last week, Comcast told the Federal Communications
                    Commission that it is "working diligently to put in place
                    the systems and processes necessary to create, maintain, and
                    display the labels as required." But according to Comcast,
                    "two aspects of the Commission's Order impose significant
                    administrative burdens and unnecessary complexity in
                    complying with the broadband label requirements."<br />[...]<br />The

                    the label rules in November 2022, it's not clear when they
                    will take effect. They are subject to a federal Office of
                    Management and Budget (OMB) review because of requirements
                    in the US Paperwork Reduction Act.<br />[...]<br />While
                    some of these fees are related to government-issued

                    found a database online that contained close to a terabyte
                    of logging data relating to Shell Recharge, the company's

                    The internal database, hosted on Amazon's cloud, contained
                    millions of logs, said Sen, including details about
                    customers who used the EV charging network. The database had
                    no password, allowing anyone on the internet to access its

                    The data, seen by TechCrunch, contained names, email
                    addresses, and phone numbers of fleet customers who use the
                    EV charging network. The database included the names of
                    fleet operators, which identified organizations — such as
                    police departments — with vehicles that recharge on the
                    network. Some of the data included vehicle identification
                    numbers, or VINs.

                    Researchers have devised a novel attack that recovers the
                    secret encryption keys stored in smart cards and smartphones
                    by using cameras in iPhones or commercial surveillance
                    systems to video record power LEDs that show when the card
                    reader or smartphone is turned on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The attacks enable a new way to exploit two previously
                    disclosed side channels, a class of attack that measures
                    physical effects that leak from a device as it performs a
                    cryptographic operation. By carefully monitoring
                    characteristics such as power consumption, sound,
                    electromagnetic emissions, or the amount of time it takes
                    for an operation to occur, attackers can assemble enough
                    information to recover secret keys that underpin the
                    security and confidentiality of a cryptographic algorithm.

                    <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/04/nsa-releases-se/"
                      >reported in 2008</a
                    >, one of the oldest known side channels was in a top-secret
                    encrypted teletype terminal that the US Army and Navy used
                    during World War II to transmit communications that couldn't
                    be read by German and Japanese spies. To the surprise of the
                    Bell Labs engineers who designed the terminal, it caused
                    readings from a nearby oscilloscope each time an encrypted
                    letter was entered. While the encryption algorithm in the
                    device was sound, the electromagnetic emissions emanating
                    from the device were enough to provide a side channel that
                    leaked the secret key.

                    Side channels have been a fact of life ever since, with new
                    ones being found regularly. The recently discovered side
                    channels tracked as Minerva and Hertzbleed came to light in
                    2019 and 2022, respectively.
                    <a href="https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz/">Minerva</a> was
                    able to recover the 256-bit secret key of a
                    US-government-approved smart card by measuring timing
                    patterns in a cryptographic process known as scalar
                    multiplication.

                      >Hertzbleed</a
                    >
                    allowed an attacker to recover the private key used by the
                    post-quantum SIKE cryptographic algorithm by measuring the
                    power consumption of the Intel or AMD CPU performing certain
                    operations. Given the use of time measurement in one and
                    power measurement in the other, Minerva is known as a timing
                    side channel, and Hertzbleed can be considered a power side
                    channel.

                    But it is not just that the sea is not as hospitable for
                    insects anymore. The hardening and drying of the cuticle via
                    the MCO2 pathway lead to a biomaterial which is not only
                    protective, but also lightweight. They postulate that this
                    may be why insects gained the ability to climb plants,
                    glide, and eventually fly. This allowed them to migrate and
                    occupy previously empty niches in the ecosystem, a strong
                    driving force that led to their sheer numbers. Again, this
                    is in contrast to crustaceans, whose shells are
                    significantly denser, with a strong correlation between
                    density and the degree of calcification.

                    Alongside their EPYC server CPU updates, as part of today's
                    AMD Data Center event, the company is also offering an
                    update on the status of their nearly-finished AMD Instinct
                    MI300 accelerator family. The company's next-generation
                    HPC-class processors, which use both Zen 4 CPU cores and
                    CDNA 3 GPU cores on a single package, have now become a
                    multi-SKU family of XPUs.

                    Joining the previously announced 128GB MI300 APU, which is
                    now being called the MI300A, AMD is also producing a pure
                    GPU part using the same design. This chip, dubbed the
                    MI300X, uses just CDNA 3 GPU tiles rather than a mix of CPU
                    and GPU tiles in the MI300A, making it a pure,
                    high-performance GPU that gets paired with 192GB of HBM3
                    memory. Aimed squarely at the large language model market,
                    the MI300X is designed for customers who need all the memory
                    capacity they can get to run the largest of models.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said the deal, which
                    would be the largest in the history of the video games
                    industry, could "substantially lessen competition" in the
                    sector.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The move comes after the UK blocked the deal over concerns
                    it would hurt competition, but the EU approved it.
                  </p>
                  <p>A trial in the US will begin in August.</p>
                  <p>
                    The FTC said in a court filing that a "preliminary
                    injunction is necessary to... prevent interim harm" while
                    the regulator determines whether "the proposed acquisition
                    violates US antitrust law".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft's proposed takeover of Activision has split global
                    regulators, and in order for the deal to go through the
                    parties need approval from regulatory bodies in the UK, the
                    EU and the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The European Commission has approved the acquisition, saying
                    that Microsoft's offer of 10-year free licensing deals -
                    which promise European consumers and cloud game streaming
                    services access to Activision's PC and console games - mean
                    there would be fair competition in the market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) blocked
                    the deal in April, saying it was concerned the takeover
                    would offer reduced innovation and less choice for gamers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft and Activision hit out at the decision and said
                    they would appeal.

                    Offering a brief update on the future of hard drives,
                    Seagate has shared some fresh insights concerning launch of
                    its next generation hard drives featuring its heat-assisted
                    magnetic recording (HAMR) technology. The company's initial
                    commercial HAMR hard drive is set to offer a 32 TB capacity,

                    >, but the new recording technology will enable a relatively
                    quick capacity increase to 40 TB. Meanwhile, high-capacity
                    HAMR HDDs will co-exist with yet-to-be-released 24 TB and 28
                    TB drives.

                    based on 10 disks and 20 heads. So, all the increase is
                    coming through areal density. The following one, 40TB, still
                    the same 10 disks and 20 heads. Also, the 50TB, we said at
                    our earnings release, in our lab, we are already running
                    individual disk at 5TB."

                    For many companies today, recruiting employees includes
                    luring them with job postings that tout the organization's
                    altruistic goals, such as to "make an impact" or fulfill a
                    mission or purpose that benefits the greater good.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Appealing to job seekers' altruism isn't just for nonprofits
                    anymore. Both for-profit and nonprofit organizations
                    increasingly employ what has been termed "social impact
                    framing" that emphasizes that their work has welfare
                    benefits for society.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although companies might have entirely noble intentions when
                    using social impact framing, a recent study by Texas McCombs
                    Assistant Professor of Management Insiya Hussain illustrates
                    how it may work against prospective employees during salary
                    negotiations. Specifically, job candidates exposed to such
                    messaging feel it would be against company norms to ask for
                    higher pay.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This speaks to a broader social phenomenon about how we
                    view money when it comes to doing good," Hussain says.
                    "There's an implicit assumption that money and altruism
                    don't mix. Money taints attempts to do good. Even if job
                    candidates might not necessarily subscribe to this view,
                    they're assuming that hiring managers will."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The research suggests job applicants might experience
                    a fearful thought process around salary: "I can't even ask.
                    I feel like if I ask, it might be held against me or against
                    the norms of the organization. It might be seen as greedy,"
                    Hussain says, paraphrasing the job seekers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers describe this attitude as a "self-censoring"
                    effect, which Hussain says is a novel finding for research
                    on social impact framing and wage demands. Prior work
                    assumed that candidates sacrificed pay for meaningful work.
                    Hussain and colleagues show this effect may be driven by job
                    candidates feeling uncomfortable with such negotiation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That mindset was true across the age spectrum and several
                    industries, including education, financial services, food
                    manufacturing, and health care — in both nonprofit and
                    for-profit businesses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Job seekers could consider whether companies that
                    stress social impact take care of their own employees —
                    financially or otherwise." Hussain says. "And, companies
                    shouldn't assume that extrinsically motivated workers don't
                    care about the job and aren't willing to work hard to
                    perform well."

                A few specifics, which may be of interest. The Board meeting
                about 10 days ago <b>did</b> discuss using the site to create a
                2nd money stream (NCommander's term) or commercialisation of the
                site (kolie's term). However a discussion with kolie on #soylent
                within the last 12 hours states:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    &lt;janrinok&gt; NCommander has also stated the at the last
                    Board meeting you discussed a '2nd money stream' for the
                    site.  Earlier you said you don't know anyone who has said
                    that.  Look at the Meta that NC wrote after that Board
                    meeting<br />
                    &lt;kolie&gt; No what we spoke about was
                    commercialization.<br />
                    &lt;kolie&gt; Which has a very specific meaning to me.<br />
                    &lt;janrinok&gt; He used the term that I did.<br />
                    &lt;kolie&gt; He did bring up very generally that he wanted
                    to raise capital to fund various things on the site.<br />
                    &lt;janrinok&gt; What were those things?<br />
                    &lt;kolie&gt; It was a distant plan, no specifics were
                    brought up, and we specifically discussed that nothing would
                    be done without community approval and we walk a very fine
                    line to not sell out.<br />
                    &lt;janrinok&gt; and how would he/you raise the capital?<br />
                    &lt;kolie&gt; Which leaves limited options without community
                    buyin.<br />
                    &lt;kolie&gt; There was no specific on what could be done -
                    more of what wouldn't work. I also don't think that raising
                    money is necessary at this time.
                  </p>
                </div>

              <p>
                One can interpret that last line in different ways but I believe
                that kolie is being truthful in making that statement which
                applies now. We cannot forecast what will happen in the future
                so for now I think we should accept that statement and press
                forward.
              </p>
              <p>
                kolie also had a discussion with AzumaHazuki where he made the
                following statement:

                    advertising on it. That's not what NC wants and it's not
                    what I would do if I was in a position to do something 
                    about it.<br />&lt;kolie2&gt; The only talks about money
                    came from - SN needs to be self sufficient in and of
                    itself.<br />&lt;kolie2&gt; I think it can do so today.<br />&lt;AzumaHazuki&gt;
                    okay, then the next question is: where does the operational
                    funding come from? i kind of doubt subscriptions are enough
                    to keep this going<br />&lt;kolie2&gt; The subscription
                    amount's I'm aware of today completely pay for hosting and
                    incorporation fees etc.<br />&lt;kolie2&gt; Theres minimal
                    cost in the current form.<br />&lt;kolie2&gt; How much comes
                    in in subs?<br />&lt;AzumaHazuki&gt; i'm not privy to that
                    information<br />&lt;kolie2&gt; I think its public or has

                    forward out of my own pocket.

                We have, as far as I am aware, always paid our bills on time and
                our funds have stayed in the black. Funding itself is not a
                major issue as there are several offers of funding already on
                the table should that be a necessary path. But it does place an
                onus on the community to subscribe when one is able to do so. We
                accept and fully understand that many of you are going through
                difficult times. There is no intention to impose a compulsory
                subscription - and I would fight very hard against it if someone
                were to suggest that as a possibility. If this comment spurs you
                into wanting to subscribe now I would suggest that you do not do
                so. Let us wait until the dust has settled rather than you
                subscribe now and something unforeseen ends up making your
                subscription a donation to charity.
              </p>

                There is also a desire for the community to be more closely
                involved in scrutinizing the Board, and even for several
                volunteers from the community to sit on the Board for a period
                of time, with the right to vote against any actions they or the
                community they represent object to. This need not be an onerous
                duty. I do not see Board meetings occurring frequently but, if
                they do occur, the community should be able to express their
                opinions. This action would prevent any individual from closing
                the site down without any serious discussion to justify such
                action. Board meetings can take place online.

                So some of the grey areas are a little clearer. There are still
                issues outstanding, but I believe that significant progress is
                being made. We have asked several times for kolie to publish a
                Meta, and he still declines from doing so. I do not agree with
                his reasoning but I must accept that decision. He is about to,
                or already has, release(d) a new journal entry.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is still a way to go, but we are getting there. Be
                optimistic. We (the staff) are continuing with an alternative
                plan as a backup in the event that our optimism is misplaced.
