              <p>How many subs should we publish on this site?</p>
              <p>
                If we'd put on just a single story for each topic (software,
                hardware, news, science, security, politics and so on), and keep
                it on the frontpage for a week, would that work for you? If we'd
                publish hundred stories each day, would you start or continue
                commenting?
              </p>
              <p>
                In short, can you think of a magic cast, in terms of number and
                frequency of stories, to lure an optimum number of people into
                posting here? If so, which would be the factors in your
                mathematical formula?

                    The Tesla, SpaceX and X (ugh) CEO has said in the past that
                    people having access to their flight data can pose a
                    security risk, but Axios asserts that the information has
                    proven to be very useful for journalists and other
                    researchers. This sort of tracking has always been part of
                    public record, but until online flight trackers started
                    taking off (I'm so sorry), it was sort of a pain in the ass
                    for most people to learn who

                  <p>
                    The outlet reports that a provision deep inside the
                    five-year FAA reauthorization bill would require the agency
                    to establish a process that would let jet owners request to
                    keep their planes' registration numbers and other
                    information private. That's lame as hell. The bill
                    reportedly passed the House by a 351-69 (nice) vote in July,
                    and now it must be reconciled with the Senate before
                    President Biden can sign it.

                    While water lilies are perhaps most famous for starring in
                    French impressionist artist Claude Monet's work, they may
                    also have a molecular secret weapon that could help in our
                    ongoing fight against fungal infections.

                  <p>
                    After viruses and bacteria, fungus is the most deadly
                    pathogen and, much like bacteria, is adapting fast to be
                    resistant to current medical interventions. While the
                    official numbers show that around 8,000 Americans die from
                    fungal infections each year, it's likely to be much higher,
                    since many cases go undiagnosed and, as an 'opportunistic
                    pathogen,' the microorganism can attack weakened immune
                    systems for complex comorbidities.

                    [...] However, there's some good news. Scientists out of the
                    University of Oklahoma (UO) may have found a molecule in a
                    species of water lily or lotus that can fight off fungal
                    infection.

                    A ragtag bunch of amateur hackers, many of them teenagers
                    with little technical training, have been so adept at
                    breaching large targets, including Microsoft, Okta, Nvidia,
                    and Globant, that the federal government is studying their

                    unsophisticated, have proved highly effective.<br />[...]<br />Rather

                    defeating MFA this way: "Call the employee 100 times at 1 am
                    while he is trying to sleep, and he will more than likely
                    accept it. Once the employee accepts the initial call, you
                    can access the MFA enrollment portal and enroll another

                    The Intel 8086 microprocessor (1978) revolutionized
                    computing by founding the x86 architecture that continues to
                    this day. One of the lesser-known features of the 8086 is
                    the "hold" functionality, which allows an external device to
                    temporarily take control of the system's bus. This feature
                    was most important for supporting the 8087 math coprocessor
                    chip, which was an option on the IBM PC; the 8087 used the
                    bus hold so it could interact with the system without
                    conflicting with the 8086 processor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This blog post explains in detail how the bus hold feature
                    is implemented in the processor's logic. (Be warned that
                    this post is a detailed look at a somewhat obscure feature.)
                    I've also found some apparently undocumented characteristics
                    of the 8086's hold acknowledge circuitry, designed to make
                    signal transition faster on the shared control lines.

                    Although polyethylene was the plastic that inspired this
                    project, the upcycling method can also work on another type
                    of plastic known as polypropylene. These two materials make
                    up much of the plastic consumers encounter every daily, from
                    product packaging to food containers to fabrics. One of the
                    exciting features of Liu's new upcycling method is that it
                    can be used on both these plastics at once, meaning that
                    it's not necessary to separate the two from each other. This
                    is a major advantage over some recycling methods used today,
                    which require careful sorting of plastics to avoid
                    contamination. That sorting process can be quite difficult,
                    because of how similar the two plastics are to each other.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another benefit of the upcycling technique is that it has
                    very simple requirements: plastic and heat. Although the
                    later steps in the process require some additional
                    ingredients to convert the wax molecules into fatty acids
                    and soap, the initial transformation of the plastic is a
                    straightforward reaction. This contributes to the method's
                    cost-effectiveness as well as its comparatively small
                    environmental impact.

                    Asus has released a new addition to its Tinker Board line of
                    Arm-based single-board computer (SBC) systems, giving
                    hobbyists and embedded developers another design option with

                    â€“ slightly smaller than a playing card â€“ the latest Tinker
                    Board 3N series sports a larger 100 x 100mm (4 x 4in)
                    footprint described by Asus as NUC-sized.

                  <p>
                    Like earlier models, the Tinker Board 3N is based on a
                    system-on-chip (SoC) from Rockchip, in this case the RK3568
                    which features a quad-core Cortex-A55 CPU cluster plus a
                    Mali-G52 GPU, while the board itself supports 2GB, 4GB or
                    8GB of LPDDR4 or LPDDR4X memory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Speaking of operating systems, Asus claims support for
                    the Tinker Board 3N with Debian or Yocto Linux, plus
                    Android. It also claims to support firmware over the air
                    (FOTA) updates for both Android and Linux.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Asus says that Tinker Board 3N will be available in three
                    versions "to meet diverse project requirements," comprising
                    Tinker Board 3N PLUS, Tinker Board 3N and Tinker Board 3N
                    LITE, but offers no information on what the differences
                    between these models are.

                  <p>
                    [...] While most Tinker Boards are based on an Arm SoC, the

                    Russia's space agency successfully launched a robotic
                    spacecraft Thursday on a journey to the Moon, the country's
                    first lunar explorer since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 sample

                    The Luna 25 mission lifted off from the Vostochny
                    Cosmodrome, located in Russia's Far East, at 7:10 pm ET
                    (23:10 UTC). Heading east, a Soyuz-2.1b rocket propelled
                    Luna 25 through an overcast cloud deck and into the
                    stratosphere, then shed its four first-stage boosters about
                    two minutes into the flight. A core stage engine fired a few
                    minutes longer, and the Soyuz rocket jettisoned its payload
                    shroud.<br />[...]<br />Russia would like the Luna 25

                    Soviet-era mission that was Russia's last probe to land on
                    the Moon, returned lunar soil samples to Earth on a robotic
                    spacecraft in August 1976, nearly four years after NASA's
                    last Apollo landing with astronauts. That feat was not

                    many as an initiative to potentially rival the US-led
                    Artemis program. Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin
                    visited the Vostochny Cosmodrome, where Luna 25 launched on
                    Thursday, and vowed to "resume the lunar program" abandoned

                    space "may well be exaggerated," citing declining Russian
                    space budgets, the drain on Russia's space program caused by
                    the war in Ukraine, and persisting mistrust between the two

                    The tantalising theory that a fifth force of nature could
                    exist has been given a boost thanks to unexpected wobbling
                    by a subatomic particle, physicists have revealed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Dr Mitesh Patel, from Imperial College London, said:
                    "We're talking about a fifth force because we can't
                    necessarily explain the behaviour [in these experiments]
                    with the four we know about."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The data comes from experiments at the Fermilab US particle
                    accelerator facility, which explored how subatomic particles
                    called muons â€“ similar to electrons but about 200 times
                    heavier â€“ move in a magnetic field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Patel says the muons behave a bit like a child's spinning
                    top, in rotating around the axis of the magnetic field.
                    However, as the muons move, they wobble. The frequency of
                    that wobble can be predicted by the standard model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the experimental results from FermiLab do not appear to
                    match those predictions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prof Jon Butterworth of University College London, who works
                    on the Atlas experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
                    at Cern, said: "The wobbles are due to the way the muon
                    interacts with a magnetic field. They can be calculated very
                    precisely in the standard model but that calculation
                    involves quantum loops, with known particles appearing in
                    those loops.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If the measurements don't line up with the prediction, that
                    could be a sign that there is some unknown particle
                    appearing in the loops â€“ which could, for example, be the
                    carrier of a fifth force."

                    HP all-in-one printer owners, upset that their devices
                    wouldn't scan or fax when low on ink, were handed a partial
                    win in a northern California court this week after a judge
                    denied HP's motion to dismiss their suit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The plaintiffs argued in their amended class action

                    [PDF] that HP withheld vital information by including
                    software in its all-in-one printer/scanner/fax machines that
                    disabled non-printing functions when out of ink and not
                    telling buyers that was the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It is well-documented that ink is not required in order to
                    scan or to fax a document, and it is certainly possible to
                    manufacture an All-in-One printer that scans or faxes when
                    the device is out of ink," the plaintiffs argued in their
                    complaint. The amended complaint was filed in February this
                    year after US federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman dismissed
                    the suit on the grounds that it hadn't properly stated a
                    claim.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Armed with their amended complaint, lawyers for San
                    Francsican Gary Freund and Minneapolis resident Wayne McMath
                    have succeeded at not only making relevant claims, but also
                    surviving an attempt by HP to have the entire case dismissed
                    for a second time.Â 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the amended complaint, Freund and McMath's lawyers argue
                    that HP's move to disable devices that were low on ink was
                    intentional, citing HP's own comments from a support forum
                    post in which an HP support agent told a user complaining of
                    similar issues that their "HP printer is designed in such a
                    way that with the empty cartridge or without the cartridge
                    [the] printer will not function."Â 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This isn't the first time HP has been taken to court
                    over claims it improperly locked printers down. In 2022 the
                    IT giant settled a European lawsuit for $1.35 million
                    alleging it used security chips and DRM-like software to
                    prevent any third-party cartridges from functioning in HP
                    printers. The US corporation has dealt with similar cases in
                    Australia and America, which were settled.Â

                  <p>
                    HP hasn't responded to our questions about the latest
                    lawsuit.

                    Coral reefs, the deep sea or the treetops of the rainforests
                    are considered the main hotspots of biodiversity. However,
                    they all trail behind the soils. According to a new study,
                    soils are the most species-rich ecosystems worldwide. Their
                    importance for human nutrition is enormous, and the
                    proportion of soils worldwide that are considered degraded
                    or destroyed is growing steadily. A trio of researchers led
                    by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and
                    Landscape Research WSL has now made the first estimate of
                    global soil biodiversity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since the data on soil diversity is extremely
                    patchyâ€”especially in the global Southâ€”the results of the
                    study show huge ranges in some cases. For bacteria, for
                    example, the mean value is 40% of species living in the
                    soilâ€”but the range extends from 25% to 88%. The
                    uncertainties are also enormous for viruses, which are
                    mainly studied as human pathogens. Accordingly, the authors
                    are bracing themselves for some criticism of their methods
                    and conclusions. "Our work is a first but important attempt
                    to estimate what proportion of global biodiversity lives in
                    the soil," says Anthony.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The goal, he says, is to provide the basis for much-needed
                    decisions to protect soils and their creatures worldwide.
                    "Soils are under enormous pressure, whether from
                    agricultural intensification, climate change, invasive
                    species and much more," Anthony points out. "Our study shows
                    that the diversity in soils is great and correspondingly
                    important, so they should be given much more consideration
                    in conservation."

                    California regulators gave approval Thursday to two rival
                    robotaxi companies, Cruise and Waymo, to operate their
                    driverless cars 24/7 across all of San Francisco and charge
                    passengers for their services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The much-anticipated vote, which followed roughly six hours
                    of public comment both for and against driverless taxis,
                    came amid clashes between the robotaxi companies and some
                    residents of the hilly city. San Francisco first responders,
                    city transportation leaders and local activists are among
                    those who shared concerns about the technology.

                    The California Public Utilities Commission regulates
                    self-driving cars in the state and voted 3-to-1 in favor of
                    Waymo and Cruise expanding their operations.

                    [...] Genevieve Shiroma, the dissenting commissioner in the
                    3-1 vote, recommended the commission delay the vote until
                    they received a "better understanding of the safety impacts"
                    of the vehicles.

                    A few weeks ago when Twitter was renamed to X, and we
                    learned that Elon Musk somehow thinks people are going to
                    use "x" as both a verb and noun, I recalled having once
                    stumbled upon this 1983 "On Language" column from the late
                    great William Safire:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        "The Federal bureaucracy has invented a new verb," says
                        Charles DeLaFuente of Kew Gardens, N.Y., who had just
                        sent in his 1040 income-tax return to the Internal
                        Revenue Service. He attached an addressed envelope that
                        he had received from the I.R.S.; in the upper left-hand
                        corner, where the return address of the taxpayer
                        belongs, is the heavy black outline of a box. Next to
                        the box are the words "X box if refund."
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        "Never mind the unanswered question, 'If refund what?',"
                        the irate taxpayer observed. "We all know they mean to x
                        the box if you have a refund coming. Maybe the ink they
                        saved on those instructions will pay for the next round
                        of tax cuts."
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Mr. DeLaFuenteâ€‰â€”â€‰his name means "of the fountain"â€‰â€”â€‰is
                        blowing his geyser for the wrong reason. The verb to x
                        is not new. In 1849, Edgar Allan Poe wrote in one of his
                        tales: "'I shell have to x this ere paragrab,' said he
                        to himself, as he read it over." In 1935, Jonas Bayer
                        carried that crossing-out metaphor into the mechanical
                        age in Startling Detective magazine: "An imported
                        hatchet man with a .45-caliber typewriter can x out the
                        dangerous canary." Merriam-Webster's first citation in
                        the one-letter verb's literal sense is from Henry
                        Cassidy's 1943 book "Moscow Dateline": "I x'd out the
                        word 'west' in the third question, changing it to
                        'east.'"

                    Intel's ARC series GPUs are interesting, in many senses of
                    the word. They offer the best implementation of Intel's
                    image reconstruction system, XeSS, similar to Nvidia's DLSS
                    and AMD's FSR. XeSS, like its counterparts, utilizes machine
                    learning to fill in the pixel gaps on anti-aliased objects
                    and scenes. The results are sometimes clear, sometimes a bit
                    fuzzy if you pay close attention. In our review of Intel's
                    A770 and A750 GPUs in late 2022, we noted that
                    cross-compatibility between all three systems could be in
                    the works.

                    That kind of easy-swap function is not the case when a game
                    is running on a customized version of the WINE
                    Windows-on-Linux, translating Direct3D graphics calls to
                    Vulkan and prodding to see whether it, too, can make use of
                    Intel's graphics boost. As noted by Phoronix, Intel
                    developers contributing to the open source Mesa graphics
                    project added the ability to hide an Intel GPU from the
                    Vulkan Linux driver.

                    Currently, Maya is being installed only in Defence Ministry
                    systems and not on computers connected to the networks of
                    the three Services. On this, the official said the three
                    Services had also vetted it and would adopt it on service
                    networks as well soon. The Navy had already cleared it and
                    the Army and the Air Force were currently evaluating it, the
                    official added.

                    Maya was developed by government development agencies within
                    six months, the official said. Maya would prevent malware
                    attacks and other cyberattacks which had seen a steep
                    increase, the official noted.

                However, the attacks in and of themselves are less of a problem
                than the fact that a large, and increasing, number of them are
                successful against that aging legacy desktop operating system.

                For India to pull this off successfully, they must study how
                their opponent has maneuvered over the years against GNU/Linux
                deployments and in particular look at case studies like Kerala,
                Munich, Lower Saxony, Vaasa, and Turku. India's opponent in this
                move has had many programmes, years ago one was
                <a href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/EDGI">EDGI</a>,
                and a long standing mandate that "under NO circumstances lose

                    Amazon ships more than a million packages daily, but there's
                    at least one person in a million who frowns when she
                    encounters a smiling box placed on her doorstep.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Canadian woman, Anca Nitu, told CBC that over the past two
                    months, more than 50 packages have arrived at her home. Each
                    package contained a return slip and a pair of shoes from an
                    Amazon buyer located in North America who wrongly shipped
                    their rejected shoes to Nitu's address.<br />[...]<br />Amazon
                    said that typically the company advises any recipient of an
                    unwanted package to fill out a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G33XVXQPUV79Z2ZC"
                      >Report Unwanted Package</a
                    >
                    form. That Amazon page says to report any unsolicited
                    packages "immediately," confirming that "third-party sellers
                    are prohibited from sending unsolicited packages to
                    customers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Nitu, her worries won't necessarily end, even if the
                    packages ever do stop coming. She told CBC that she has no
                    idea whether the Amazon sellers that are using her
                    information to ship unwanted return items are doing anything
                    else with her information. She also worries that if Amazon
                    doesn't unlink her name from the seller accounts, she could
                    one day be charged Amazon seller fees.

                Fermilab's g-2 experiment has released a new round of data.
                Physicists now have a brand-new measurement of a property of the
                muon called the anomalous magnetic moment that improves the
                precision of their previous result by a factor of 2. The result
                is in tension with Standard Model predictions.
              </p>
              <p>
                An international collaboration of scientists working on the Muon
                g-2 experiment at the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermi National
                Accelerator Laboratory announced the much-anticipated updated
                measurement on Aug. 10. This new value bolsters the first result
                they announced in April 2021 and sets up a showdown between
                theory and experiment over 20 years in the making.
              </p>
              <p>
                "We're really probing new territory. We're determining the muon
                magnetic moment at a better precision than it has ever been seen
                before," said Brendan Casey, a senior scientist at Fermilab who
                has worked on the Muon g-2 experiment since 2008.

                    "The sun is more surprising than we knew," said Mehr Un
                    Nisa, a postdoctoral research associate at Michigan State
                    University. "We thought we had this star figured out, but
                    that's not the case."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nisa, who will soon be joining [Michigan State University's]
                    faculty, is the corresponding author of a new paper in the
                    journal <i>Physical Review Letters</i> that details the
                    discovery of the highest-energy light ever observed from the
                    sun.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The international team behind the discovery also found that
                    this type of light, known as gamma rays, is surprisingly
                    bright. That is, there's more of it than scientists had
                    previously anticipated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although the high-energy light doesn't reach the Earth's
                    surface, these gamma rays create telltale signatures that
                    were detected by Nisa and her colleagues working with the
                    High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory, or HAWC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We now have observational techniques that weren't
                    possible a few years ago," said Nisa, who works in the
                    Department of Physics and Astronomy in the College of
                    Natural Science. "In this particular energy regime, other
                    ground-based telescopes couldn't look at the sun because
                    they only work at night," she said. "Ours operates 24/7."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "After looking at six years' worth of data, out popped
                    this excess of gamma rays," Nisa said. "When we first saw
                    it, we were like, 'We definitely messed this up. The sun
                    cannot be this bright at these energies.'"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The gamma rays that Nisa and her colleagues observed
                    had about 1 trillion electron volts, or 1 tera electron
                    volt, abbreviated 1 TeV. Not only was this energy level
                    surprising, but so was the fact that they were seeing so
                    much of it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This shows that HAWC is adding to our knowledge of
                    our galaxy at the highest energies, and it's opening up
                    questions about our very own sun," Nisa said. "It's making
                    us see things in a different light. Literally."

                    Improving those speeds by a factor of between 10 and 100
                    with lasers therefore has an obvious benefit â€“ even if the
                    pesky limit that is the speed of light means it won't allow

                    When Zoom was used for training the sound classification
                    algorithm, the prediction accuracy dropped to 93%, which is
                    still dangerously high, and a record for that medium.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such an attack severely affects the target's data security,
                    as it could leak people's passwords, discussions, messages,
                    or other sensitive information to malicious third parties.

                  <p>
                    Moreover, contrary to other side-channel attacks that
                    require special conditions and are subject to data rate and
                    distance limitations, acoustic attacks have become much
                    simpler due to the abundance of microphone-bearing devices
                    that can achieve high-quality audio captures.

                    The basic idea of turning an asteroid into a rotating space
                    habitat has existed for a while. Despite that, it's always
                    seemed relatively far off regarding technologies, so the
                    concept hasn't received much attention over the years.<br />...
                    <br />David W. Jensen, a retired Technical Fellow at
                    Rockwell Collins ... released a 65-page paper that details
                    an easy-to-understand, relatively inexpensive, and feasible
                    plan to turn an asteroid into a space habitat. <br />...
                    <br />
                    Dr. Jensen breaks the discussion into three main categories
                    â€“ asteroid selection, habitat style selection, and mission
                    strategy to get there (i.e., what robots to use). <br />...
                    <br />After a relatively in-depth selection process, Dr.
                    Jensen decided on one in particular as a good candidate â€“
                    Atira. This S-type asteroid has an entire class of asteroids
                    named after it. Atira comes in at about a 4.8 km diameter
                    and even has its own moon â€“ a 1 km diameter asteroid that
                    orbits it closely. <br />... <br />He eventually settled on
                    a torus as the ideal habitat type and then dives into
                    calculations about the overall station mass, how to support
                    the inner wall with massive columns, and how to allocate
                    floor space. All important, but how exactly would we build
                    such a massive behemoth? <br />Self-replicating robots are
                    Dr. Jensen's answer. The report's third section details a
                    plan to utilize spider robots and a base station that can
                    replicate themselves. He stresses the importance of only
                    sending the most advanced technical components from Earth
                    and using materials on the asteroid itself to build
                    everything else, from rock grinders to solar panels.

                    recent voyage of NASA's intrepid Ingenuity helicopter on
                    Mars was nothing special. Over a period of 24 seconds, the
                    small helicopter rose to an altitude 5 meters above the red
                    planet's dusty surface and then touched back down in the

                    US scientists responsible for a historic nuclear fusion
                    breakthrough say they have repeated the featâ€”this time
                    achieving a greater yield of energy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory stunned the world
                    in December when it announced it had carried out an
                    experimental nuclear reaction that put out more energy than
                    was put into it, a holy grail of science in the quest for
                    unlimited, clean power to end the era of fossil fuels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We can confirm the experiment produced a higher yield than
                    the December 2022 experiment," public information officer
                    Paul Rhien said Monday in an emailed statement, without
                    disclosing specific figures.

                  <p>
                    He added the California lab planned to report the results at
                    upcoming scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed
                    publications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Nuclear fusion has been touted by its supporters as a
                    clean, abundant and safe source of energy that could
                    eventually allow humanity to break its dependence on coal,
                    crude oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbons driving a
                    global climate crisis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, there is still a long way to go before fusion is
                    viable on an industrial scale, providing power to homes and
                    businesses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] During December's experiment, the lab used 192
                    ultra-powerful lasers to deliver 2.05 megajoules of energy
                    to a tiny capsule smaller than a pea containing isotopes of
                    hydrogen. It produced 3.15 megajoules of fusion energy
                    output.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the result was a net energy gain, 300 megajoules of
                    energy was needed from the electrical grid to power the
                    lasers.

                    [...] Ensuring that's all correctly set up adds extra time
                    and complexity, making for a much more time-consuming
                    experience than pulling into a gas station and simply

                    Despite a downward trend in recent months, EVs still remain,
                    on average, more expensive to buy than gas cars, and that's
                    a big issue for buyers on a tighter budget.Â

                    [...] Another key factor for buyers to consider when
                    purchasing a car is how long they expect it to last. Modern
                    cars now last longer on average than ever before, largely
                    due to improvements in materials and the manufacturing
                    process over time. However, EVs also feature an extra
                    variable that, for now, remains largely unknown: how much
                    the battery will degrade over the years it's on the
                    road.Â Most of the current data we have to examine
                    degradation comes from Tesla, and it seems promising â€“- on
                    average, the brand claimed its battery lost only 12% of its
                    capacity over 200,000 miles.

                    claimed certain models could reach problematic levels of
                    degradation in less than a decade, with batteries degrading
                    more rapidly once they lose 30% capacity. This, in turn,
                    could make older EVs effectively unsellable, especially
                    those with lower ranges from the factory to begin with.Â

                    [...] With extreme temperatures becoming more common in the
                    face of climate change, another flaw EVs face is that they
                    generally don't cope very well with colder climates. In
                    fact,

                    to 77Â°F, according to the
                    <a

                      >Department of Energy</a
                    >. In comparison, a gas car only loses 15% of its range on
                    average. A 41% drop in range is a deal breaker for many
                    people, especially in places where such temperatures are
                    expected throughout significant parts of the winter months.

                    Not only that, but a study by the

                      >Idaho National Laboratory</a
                    >
                    found that charging times were much slower in cold weather
                    too. A 30-minute charge with a DCFC fast charger saw
                    researchers achieve an 80% charge at 77Â°F, but at 32Â°F, they
                    only recorded 44% charge.Â

                  <p>
                    There's no obvious solution to these issues for now, but EV
                    manufacturers will have to address them in the immediate
                    future if they have any hope of convincing northern buyers
                    that it's worth the switch to electric.

                There's a transition in car computing hardware from roughly 100
                little modules all over the car, each with a tiny amount of
                computing, to, "domain controllers" that each manage a lot of
                I/O using more powerful computing. MotorTrend gives an overview

                Paraphrasing an auto technician training site (can't find
                reference now):<br />Mechanical problems are easy/fast to
                diagnose (they can be seen), but time-consuming / hard to
                fix.<br />Electrical/electronic problems are hard/slow to

                What are the chances that the car companies will give more than
                lip service to the questions of service/diagnosis for all this

                    Processor companies typically iterate off proven designs,
                    and for good reason. Changing too many things at once
                    introduces a lot of risk. A lot of changing parts makes it
                    hard to get a good picture of overall performance, so it
                    also makes tuning difficult. Pentium 4 and Bulldozer made
                    clean breaks from prior architectures, and both were
                    unsuccessful designs. But sometimes, making a clean break
                    does pay off.

                  <p>
                    Sandy Bridge is one such case. It inherited architectural
                    features from Intel's prior P6 and Netburst architectures,
                    but can't be considered a member of either line. Unlike
                    Netburst, Sandy Bridge was so successful that Intel's high
                    performance cores to this day can trace their lineage to
                    back to it. In the early 2010s, Sandy Bridge was so
                    successful that Intel went completely unchallenged in the
                    high end CPU market. And as a testament to the
                    architecture's solid design, Sandy Bridge CPUs still deliver
                    enough performance to remain usable across a range of
                    everyday tasks.

                        This is from Microsoft's explanation. The China
                        attackers "acquired an inactive MSA consumer signing key
                        and used it to forge authentication tokens for Azure AD
                        enterprise and MSA consumer to access OWA and
                        Outlook.com. All MSA keys active prior to the
                        incidentâ€”including the actor-acquired MSA signing
                        keyâ€”have been invalidated. Azure AD keys were not
                        impacted. Though the key was intended only for MSA
                        accounts, a validation issue allowed this key to be
                        trusted for signing Azure AD tokens. The actor was able
                        to obtain new access tokens by presenting one previously
                        issued from this API due to a design flaw. This flaw in
                        the GetAccessTokenForResourceAPI has since been fixed to
                        only accept tokens issued from Azure AD or MSA
                        respectively. The actor used these tokens to retrieve
                        mail messages from the OWA API."

                    NASA has succeeded in re-establishing full contact with
                    Voyager 2 by using its highest-power transmitter to send an
                    "interstellar shout" that righted the distant probe's
                    antenna orientation, the space agency said Friday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Launched in 1977 to explore the outer planets and serve as a
                    beacon of humanity to the wider universe, it is currently
                    more than 12.3 billion miles (19.9 billion kilometers) from
                    our planetâ€”well beyond the solar system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A series of planned commands sent to the spaceship on July
                    21 mistakenly caused the antenna to point two degrees away
                    from Earth, compromising its ability to send and receive
                    signals and endangering its mission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The situation was not expected to be resolved until at least
                    October 15 when Voyager 2 was scheduled to carry out an
                    automated realignment maneuver.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But on Tuesday, engineers enlisted the help of multiple
                    Earth observatories that form the Deep Space Network (DSN)
                    to detect a carrier or "heartbeat" wave from Voyager 2,
                    though the signal was still too faint to read the data it
                    carried.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new update on Friday, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
                    (JPL), which built and operates the probe, said it had
                    succeeded in a longshot effort to send instructions that
                    righted the craft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The Deep Space Network used the highest-power transmitter
                    to send the command (the 100-kw S-band uplink from the
                    Canberra site) and timed it to be sent during the best
                    conditions during the antenna tracking pass in order to
                    maximize possible receipt of the command by the spacecraft,"
                    Voyager project manager Suzanne Dodd told AFP.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This so-called "interstellar shout" required 18.5 hours
                    traveling at light speed to reach Voyager, and it took 37
                    hours for mission controllers to learn whether the command
                    worked, JPL said in a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The probe began returning science and telemetry data at
                    12:29 am Eastern Time on August 4, "indicating it is
                    operating normally and that it remains on its expected
                    trajectory," added JPL.

                    Most modern marine vessels are heavily equipped with
                    technology, from GPS and navigation systems to electronic
                    chart displays and information systems (ECDIS). The arrival
                    of this new technology has sailed superyachts into dangerous
                    waters with a new type of pirate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Owning a superyacht is a luxury for the world's financial
                    elite due to the exorbitant cost of buying and maintaining
                    one. High-tech superyachts with wealthy owners create the
                    perfect combination for bounty-hungry hacking pirates.

                    [...] Cyber security expert Naveen Hemanna explains how the
                    rise of digital banking and cryptocurrencies helps fuel this
                    form of crime. He told Euronews, "The pirates need not be on
                    the boat. It's all virtual warfare, which is happening
                    because your wealth is also not physical. It's virtual, so
                    you don't really need to have a physical presence to get
                    that money out".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cyber threats to yachts have increased since COVID, proving
                    that it's not plain sailing for yacht owners in the modern
                    world. However, the future of marine vessels is becoming
                    more sustainable and eco-friendly for the waters they are
                    sailing in.

                    Although the Perseid meteor shower is visible this year from

                    early on August 13. Stargazers can expect to see up to 100
                    meteors per hour traveling at 37 miles per second, NASA
                    notes.

                    "With swift and bright meteors, Perseids frequently leave
                    long 'wakes' of light and color behind them as they streak
                    through Earth's atmosphere," NASA explains. "Perseids are
                    also known for their fireballs, which are larger explosions
                    of light and color that can persist longer than an average
                    meteor streak."

                    Comets, which originate far outside the orbit of the
                    outermost planets, have elliptical orbits around the Sun.
                    For perspective, since they can be miles in diameter,
                    <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/comets">NASA notes</a> that
                    they are about the "size of a small town."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Comets are essentially a giant "dirty snowball" made of
                    frozen gasses with embedded rock and dust particles, NASA
                    continues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As comets near the Sun during their orbit, they warm,
                    freeing bits of rock and dust that are then left behind in
                    what can be thought of as a trail of debris. Every year,
                    when Earth passes through these trails of rock and dust on
                    its own orbit around the Sun, the debris particles collide
                    with Earth's atmosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When this happens, the particles heat up to temperatures of
                    around 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, creating streaks across the
                    sky,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.space.com/3113-meteors-meteor-showers-science.html"
                      >Space.com explains</a
                    >. Those streaks, or shooting stars, stop abruptly when the
                    intense heat evaporates most meteors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fragments of space debris that collide with Earth's
                    atmosphere to create the Perseid meteor shower each summer
                    were left in the wake of a comet named 109P/Swift-Tuttle.
                    The comet has a unique name because it was discovered in
                    1862 independently by both Lewis Swift and Horace Tuttle,
                    NASA explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Swift-Tuttle is a large comet with a nucleus that is 16
                    miles wide. Amazingly, it takes 133 years for it to orbit
                    the Sun.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although meteor showers are caused by comet debris colliding
                    with Earth's atmosphere, they are named for their radiant â€”
                    where they appear to come from in the night sky.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Perseid meteor shower gets its name because its meteors
                    appear to come from the constellation Perseus, named for the
                    famed Greek hero. Perseus not only slew Medusa the Gorgon
                    who had snakes as hair, he also rescued his future wife
                    Andromeda from a sea monster sent by Poseidon to destroy the
                    coast and land of Ethiopia.

                    In a couple of days, I pack up my bags to head for DEFCON.
                    In a rare moment of pre-planning, perhaps spurred by
                    boredom, I looked through the schedule to see what's in
                    store in the world of telephony. There is a workshop on SS7,
                    of course [1], plenty of content on cellular, but as far as
                    I see nothing on the biggest topic in telecom security:
                    STIR/SHAKEN.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I can venture a guess as to why: STIR/SHAKEN is boring. So
                    here we go!
                  </p>
                  <p>The Nature of Circuit Switching</p>
                  <p>
                    Understanding today's robocalling problem requires starting
                    a long time ago. Taking you all the way back to the
                    invention of the telephone would be a little gratuitous, but
                    it is useful to start our discussion with the introduction
                    of direct distance dialing in 1951. In that year, the first
                    long-distance call was completed based only on the customer
                    dialing a number. Over the following decades direct distance
                    dialing became more common and fewer telephone users had to
                    speak to an operator to have a long-distance call
                    established. Today, it's universal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Handling dial calls over long distance trunks is a bit
                    complicated, though. For local calls, handling was
                    relatively simple. The other customer was connected to the
                    same exchange that you were, so the exchange just needed to
                    be able to detect your dialing and select the correct local
                    loop corresponding to the number you dialed. Step-by-step
                    (SxS) switches have been handling this problem since the
                    turn of the 20th century. For long distance calls, though,
                    the recipient will not be on the same switch---they'll be on
                    a foreign exchange.

                When things don't work out for scooter rental companies and they
                shut down or pull out of a city, they usually take spare stock
                with them. However, when Spin backed out of Seattle, many locals
                discovered unused scooters scattered throughout the city. Upon
                closer inspection of these abandoned devices, or should we say
                dissection, it was uncovered that they each have a Raspberry Pi
                4B inside.
              </p>
              <p>
                This discovery was recently shared on social media. Legally, if
                the scooters are abandoned then snagging one for the Pi inside
                is fair game but it's not clear if Spin has plans to recover
                their remaining assets.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Seattle city government official website confirm that Spin
                originally arrived in 2021 as a fourth scooter rental option.
                However, the company did not renew its license for the most
                recent cycle. Because of this, you can find a few remaining Spin
                scooters around the city.

                    from 2019 granting news agencies' so-called "neighboring
                    rights." These rights were designed to reduce the "value
                    gap" between publishers and the online platforms that profit
                    off of promoting publishers' content.

                  <p>
                    AFP filed the copyright case after becoming concerned about
                    "the clear refusal" from X to "enter into discussions
                    regarding the implementation of neighboring rights for the
                    press," the AFP press release said. During discussions, AFP
                    said that X was expected to share data that would help the
                    news agency calculate how much money X owed for profiting
                    off of AFP's news content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now AFP is seeking an "urgent injunction" ordering X to
                    "provide all the necessary elements required for assessing
                    the remuneration owed to AFP under the neighboring rights
                    legislation."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    X and AFP did not immediately respond to Ars' request to
                    comment.

                    Developers across the world are mourning the loss of Bram
                    Moolenaar, renowned Dutch software engineer and creator of
                    the Vim text editor:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Beyond creating an industry standard for text editing
                    software, Moolenaar also pioneered an open-source and
                    community-driven approach to its development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He was the first to coin the term "charityware." Although
                    users may use and copy Vim for free, they are encouraged to
                    donate to the International Child Care Fund Holland to help
                    children in Uganda.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I have never wanted to make money from Vim," said Moolenaar
                    in an interview last year. "It started as a hobby and most
                    of the time I had a job that paid well enough."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Donations amount to around â‚¬30,000 per year â€” enough to help
                    about 50 children finish their education, from primary
                    school to university.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While he might have logged off from this world for
                    good, Moolenaar's legacy and Vim â€” a text editor that
                    continues to empower developers across the globe â€” lives on.

                In 1965, Popular Hot Rodding magazine bought a $250 '57 Chevy

                    small-blocks, big-blocks, mechanical fuel Injection,

                    even electronic fuel injection. The Project X 1957 Chevy has
                    had it all over the decades. It was a car constantly

                Along the way it also appeared in the movie Hollywood Knights

                20 years ago it want back to GM for a "makeover" including a
                modified Corvette front suspension, and since then it picked up

                    At this point our best 60-foot time was a solid 1.54
                    seconds. We were really happy with that time but at around
                    100 feet the system was dropping the voltage and killing our
                    ET. The engineers kept working on the issue and eventually
                    the car was waking up again around the 570-foot mark, but
                    that loss in the middle was still hurting our overall time.
                    The best analogy is an EFI car with fuel-control issues, but
                    instead of running out of fuel, we were losing electricity
                    flow.

                    The MBR solar park's research and development unit is
                    already exploring practical solar innovations to integrate
                    into Dubai's metropolitan environment and reduce energy
                    costs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It has developed metallic trees with sprouted photovoltaic
                    leaves in addition to solar-powered street lamps and
                    pavements.

                    The MBR Solar Park claims many world records with its
                    projects, including the construction of what will be the
                    world's tallest concentrated solar power (CSP) tower.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The solar spire stands at about 260 metres high, which is
                    roughly 60 metres short of Paris' Eiffel Tower.

                  <p>
                    It will use around 70,000 heliostats like mirrors to magnify
                    the sun's rays into thermal energy and store it for about 15
                    hours - able to provide electricity around the clock,
                    solving a major issue with renewable technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The installation is part of the project's fourth phase,
                    which plans to double its energy production upon completion.

                  <p>
                    [...] In line with the 2015 Paris Climate agreement goals,
                    the UAE is using such investment to build a combination of
                    solar, nuclear, and other renewable energy sources, which
                    will create a need for smarter grid management systems.

                    "The mantra is decarbonization, decentralization, and
                    digitalization," says Ramaswamy, who forecasts that the
                    final stage will incorporate big data, artificial
                    intelligence, and blockchain into the mix to coordinate the
                    new normal of powering cities.

                A team of paleontologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
                working with colleagues from Xi'an Jiaotong University, the
                University of York, the University of Chinese Academy of
                Sciences and the National Research Center on Human Evolution,
                has found evidence of a previously unknown human lineage. In
                their study, reported in Journal of Human Evolution, the group
                analyzed the fossilized jawbone, partial skull and some leg
                bones of a hominin dated to 300,000 years ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                The fossils were excavated at a site in Hualongdong, in what is
                now a part of East China. They were subsequently subjected to
                both a morphological and a geometric assessment, with the
                initial focus on the jawbone, which exhibited unique featuresâ€”a
                triangular lower edge and a unique bend.

                    In a world first, a quadriplegic man in the United States
                    has regained touch and movement after surgeons successfully
                    implanted microchips into his brain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AI is then used to read, interpret and translate his
                    thoughts into action.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Keith Thomas, 45, broke his neck in an accident and became
                    paralysed from his chest down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A team of medical professionals first spent months
                    mapping Thomas' brain using MRIs to help pinpoint the areas
                    responsible for both arm movement and the sensation of touch
                    in his hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>He then underwent a 15-hour open-brain surgery.</p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Dr Ashesh Mehta, the surgeon who performed Thomas'
                    brain surgery said the wiring in Thomas' brain was "broken".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "What we did was a bypass, so we bypassed the block.
                    So, we're basically using a computer to read Keith's
                    thoughts and then translate that into a machine that then
                    stimulates his hand so that he can move it," explained
                    Mehta.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The procedure - dubbed as a "double neural bypass" - goes
                    the other direction as well. He can now "feel" something
                    through tiny electrodes instead of neurons responsible for
                    feeling his fingertips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The tiny sensors at his fingertips and palm send touch and
                    pressure information back to the sensory area of his brain
                    implant to restore sensation through a computer instead of
                    through the normal pathway through the spinal cord.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's almost like fooling the nervous system to make it
                    work," said Mehta.

                    in court. Lichtenstein has admitted that he used multiple
                    advanced hacking tools and techniques to gain entry into the
                    cryptocurrency exchange's network. He then authorized 2,000
                    transactions to move 119,754 bitcoins to wallets he
                    controlled. To cover his tracks, he said he deleted access
                    credentials, logs and other digital breadcrumbs that could
                    give him away. Morgan, his wife, helped him move and launder
                    the stolen funds.Â

                    If you'll recall, the Justice Department seized 95,000 of
                    the stolen bitcoins at the time of their arrest. Back then,
                    that digital coin hoard was worth a whopping $3.6 billion
                    and was the largest financial seizure in the agency's
                    history. Authorities were able to trace more of the stolen
                    funds after that to recover an additional $475 million worth
                    of cryptocurrency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the DOJ, Lichtenstein and Morgan used false
                    identities to set up online accounts on darknet markets and
                    cryptocurrency exchanges. They then withdrew the funds and
                    distributed the bitcoins from there by converting them into
                    other forms of cryptocurrency and keeping them in crypto
                    mixing services. By doing so, they obfuscated the coins'
                    sources and made them harder to trace.

                    Many of the most attractive premium features in Tesla
                    vehicles are things that all of the cars are physically
                    capable of but are locked down at the software level. Since
                    there are always security researchers and hackers trying to
                    pick those proverbial locks, it was inevitable that someone
                    would figure it out. And as of this week, that has finally
                    happened.

                  <p>
                    According to a new report from

                    "We are not the evil outsider, but we're actually the
                    insider, we own the car," researcher and TU Berlin Ph.D.
                    candidate Christian Werling told TechCrunch. "And we don't
                    want to pay these $300 for the rear heated seats."

                  <p>
                    Specifically, he and his colleagues used a technique called
                    voltage glitching or a voltage fault injection attack to
                    disrupt the AMD processor that powers the car'sÂ Tesla
                    Infotainment System and get it to do their bidding.Â "If we
                    do it at the right moment, we can trick the CPU into doing
                    something else," Welling added. "It has a hiccup, skips an
                    instruction, and accepts our manipulated code. That's
                    basically what we do in a nutshell."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the report, this new exploit could also enable
                    hackers to activate the $15,000 self-driving feature in
                    regions where it's locked out, though the researchers
                    haven't tried that themselves yet. But since the
                    vulnerability â€” while affecting software capabilities â€” is
                    hardware-based, Tesla can't patch it, with the researchers
                    telling TechCrunch that a fix would require replacing the
                    affected hardware. Tesla did not respond to TechCrunch's
                    request for comment on the exploit.
