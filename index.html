              <b>Roadmap Moving Forward</b>
              <p>
                We talked about the state of things to come for over an hour,
                and then I had one on one calls with Matt and kolie. The
                conversation was fairly high-level, and mostly consisted of a
                recap of the last few weeks, current progress, as well as what
                actually rebuilding the site is going to look like. Right now,
                we have a commitment to finishing the infrastructure overhaul,
                and upgrade it as is practical.
              </p>
              <p>
                That would basically bring us to the "ok for now" status quo ...
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the status quo does not address the dwindling signal to
                noise ratios or shrinking community. It does not address the
                lack of moderation or content standards. It does not address our
                problems relating to SEO or anything resembling modern human
                interface guidelines. It also does not resolve the long standing
                problems that lead to here.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also had a fairly long conversation on the circumstances that
                lead to here and how we avoid a repeat of ending back on the
                brink.
              </p>
              <p>
                We still have the question of what we will do in the immediate
                future.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have no illusion that staff are happy to work with me, but I
                am hoping we can at least define some sort of formal truce in
                the name of the future of the site. However, members of the
                staff have been demanding for me to step down and simply get
                out.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have been given the impression that if I was to step down,
                they would simply continue the site as is. I am unaware of any
                defined plan relating to fixing any of the problems plaguing the
                site, both as it is now, and those that have persisted long
                before this point.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have also been given the impression that if I do not simply
                GTFO soon, they're simply going to quit.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's fair and understandable given everything that has
                happened.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, I am not the only stakeholder, as currently, Matt as
                co-owner, and kolie, as an interested outside party who is
                actively helping to fix the site, have both indicated that they
                want me to stay involved at this time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, dealing with the deferred maintenance is going to
                take priority. Given everything, I don't see how I can have a
                revised plan for SoylentNews any earlier than July, and
                realistically I expect it to take longer to have a solid
                agreement hashed out by all stakeholders.
              </p>
              <p>
                The staff should be a part of this discussion. However, at this
                point, they have at this point only made demands, and have made
                no attempts that I am aware of to negotiate anything. Unilateral
                demands is not a negotiation.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is part of a larger problem that, at the end of the day,
                the staff had no true stake if the site succeeded or failed.
                This is compounded by the fact that no one has been willing to
                put themselves forward to join as a member of the board of the
                directors since mrcoolbp disappeared, and since none are
                apparently willing to work with me, the person who is both
                president and 50% owner, well, it leaves us at an impasse.
              </p>
              <p>
                The easiest thing to do is to allow them to present their case
                as to why I shouldn't be involved and show to everyone that they
                can lay out a realistic plan to deal with the issues that have
                long plagued this website. After all, if they're so insistent
                that I shouldn't be involved, then as a matter of due diligence,
                I need them to show a plan that involves fixing the site, and
                actual work being doing towards it.
              </p>
              <p>
                For my part, I will do the same in the form of a new business
                plan for the PBC that will specifically explain why we are
                taking money in, how we will use it, how we are going to deal
                with raising capital in the future, and everything else that is
                involved in keeping SN going for another decade. Such a plan is
                going to require both kolie and I to discuss the specifics of
                what replacing rehash is going to require.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of the day, regardless of who was responsible, SN
                decayed to the point that the database was suffering from
                corrupted tables. That has to be addressed, and ultimately,
                until some else steps up to the plate, and presents a workable
                plan, that falls to me
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Infrastructure Rebuild</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, talk is cheap, so here's what I have actually done in
                the last two weeks with help from kolie.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have been making slow but steady progress on this. The plan
                is to convert the entire site to an ansible playbook, which now
                exists. We have successfully started deploying site services on
                a fresh set of Linode accounts. So far, kolie has got the public
                wiki rendering, bringing it from MediaWiki 1.18 to a currently
                supported version.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meanwhile, I've been digging deeper into rehash. In any scenario
                that involves the site continuing, we are going to need to be
                able to deploy code changes. Fortunately, when I did the work to
                get the site running on Apache 2, I left myself a lot of good
                notes on how it all works, as well as the "make
                build-production-environment" target which handles a lot of the
                worst parts of how to deal with the mountain of legacy Perl.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is slowly coming together in building a

                  href="%E2%80%9Dhttps://github.com/SoylentNews/rehash/blob/master/Dockerfile%E2%80%9D"
                  >Dockerfile</a
                >
                that's on the public

                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                As of writing, I have gotten it to the point it can successfully
                run the install target. I wrote some rather hacky code that
                handles shoving connection database information into the system
                DBIx::Password module, because that's what rehash requires, and
                I was reminded again why this is the codebase from hell.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have also had a longer discussion towards implementing new
                services like status monitoring. A member of the community
                submitted a long and detailed plan to implement Prometheus for
                service monitoring. We're not quite ready for that, but we also
                need to talk about specifically access to the backend.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Infrastructure Access</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                When I formally announced the shutdown for SoylentNews PBC, I
                locked out all shell accounts to the backend as well as limited
                access to the Linode panel. This was done both to protect the
                site and as a matter of liability. When the circumstances
                changed, access to the backend was not restored. Access to
                rehash's administration panel however remained available, which
                is how janirirok and the other editors have been posting
                articles. The #chillax channel remains up, although I'm no
                longer in it.
              </p>
              <p>
                I didn't restore access after the situation changed. There are
                quite a few reasons I could give, but given the sheer amount of
                hostility I have received from certain individual members of the
                staff, I could not and cannot rule out the possibility that
                someone would simply "rm -rf /" the production environment out
                of sheer spite. Also, these machines are going away. There isn't
                going to be shell access beyond this point aside from a control
                node.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now, the current plan is to simply get the site back to
                the level of functionality it had back in November, with as many
                parts of infrastructure being fully up to date as-is possible.
                This includes going through the configs, removing obsolete bits,
                and basically reviewing every aspect of the underlying nuts and
                bolts.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am going to be taking a solid look at getting rehash ported to
                the current versions of Apache 2.4 and mod_perl. It mostly
                depends how much of the stack can be built on mod_perl 2.4
                easily. At least with the site on deployable infrastructure, it
                drastically simplifies what it will take to move forward.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Timeline Moving Forward</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Fixing SN is going to require people to be involved and
                dedicated to rebuilding and essentially relaunching the site as
                well as fixing many of the problems that have led to here.
              </p>
              <p>
                To ask that without providing some sort of compensation is folly
                but without a defined plan, well, we end up in a catch-22
                situation.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, here's what I'm going to do and what I am going to ask of
                anyone who stays involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will have the site migrated to less broken infrastructure by
                the end of June at the latest, and likely well before that
                point.
              </p>
              <p>
                After that migration is complete, kolie and I are going to
                negotiate a contract that will handle either overhauling or
                outright replacement of rehash. This agreement is going to
                define any new functionality that will be built into what will
                essentially be version 2 of this website.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also need to define what specifically is the role of various
                volunteers in the upkeep of this site, as well as defining our
                options in case we ever end in another situation like this five
                or ten years down the road.
              </p>
              <p>
                If there's one thing I have surmised, no one is happy with this
                situation, but a big part of moving forward is having an
                agreement on how it will be maintained and have some flexibility
                going forward.
              </p>
              <p>
                A major point of this is growing SoylentNews's cash flow to the
                point that it can reasonably afford to have at least one paid
                staff member and provide some actual incentives to keep people
                involved in its upkeep and overall maintenance.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have quite a few ideas on how to approach this, but I rather
                have a chance to write them out in-depth and explore them.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of this, I also want to deal with raising the overall
                signal to noise ratio, increasing the number of comments per
                article, and hopefully bringing in new blood to the site. It's
                very hard to have any idea as of the state of the health of the
                community as we don't have any analytics, and have historically
                only ever run PiWik for a short period of time.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think we need to consider doing that again, if only to have an
                idea of where we are in terms of actual readership and
                engagement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, there needs to be a reason why someone might post
                inbound links to SoylentNews, and once someone clicks on them,
                sticks around longer than a few seconds. That also makes finding
                such content easier for both humans and search engines.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are just some ideas off the top of my head. Realistically,
                I'm going to need to sit with a pen and paper, sound out which
                ones are practical with kolie and Matt, and then start taking
                steps to implement them, with whomever is willing to join us
                going forward.
              </p>

                    the company's policy to have workers return to the office
                    for at least three days a week, telling stories about how
                    the remote work kicked off by the COVID pandemic bought them
                    precious hours at home with their family and saved them from

                    idea to the company's climate goals, highlighting how remote
                    work allowed more families to become one-car households.

                    What would the Earth look like to an alien civilization
                    located light years away? A team of researchers from
                    Mauritius and Manchester University has used crowd-sourced
                    data to simulate radio leakage from mobile towers and
                    predict what an alien civilization might detect from various
                    nearby stars, including Barnard's star, six light years away
                    from Earth. Ramiro Saide, currently an intern at the SETI
                    Institute's Hat Creek Radio Observatory and M.Phils. student
                    at the University of Mauritius, generated models displaying
                    the radio power that these civilizations would receive as
                    the Earth rotates and the towers rise and set. Saide
                    believes that unless an alien civilization is much more
                    advanced than ours, they would have difficulty detecting the
                    current levels of mobile tower radio leakage from Earth.
                    However, the team suggests that some technical civilizations
                    are likely to have much more sensitive receiving systems
                    than we do, and the detectability of our mobile systems will
                    increase substantially as we move to much more powerful
                    broadband systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team is eager to extend their research to include
                    other contributors to the Earth's radio leakage signature.
                    The next step is to include powerful civilian and military
                    radars, new digital broadcast systems, Wi-Fi networks,
                    individual mobile handsets and the swarm of satellite
                    constellations now being launched into low Earth orbit, such
                    as Elon Musk's Starlink system. According to Garrett,
                    "Current estimates suggest we will have more than one
                    hundred thousand satellites in low Earth orbit and beyond
                    before the end of the decade. The Earth is already
                    anomalously bright in the radio part of the spectrum; if the
                    trend continues, we could become readily detectable by any
                    advanced civilization with the right technology."

                    On Call Welcome once again, dear reader, to On Call,
                    <i>The Register</i>'s weekly reader-contributed tales of
                    tortuous tech support traumas and triumphs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as "Leif" who, back
                    in the day, was given quite a challenge: a vendor's European
                    office expanded into an adjacent office building, but the
                    move would take months – and the network in both buildings
                    needed to be connected throughout, and keep working within
                    the buildings they served.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Leif and his fellow techies therefore hatched a plan.
                    The buildings were so close together – with trees between
                    the two facilities – surely it would not be hard to just
                    throw an ethernet cable from one to the other?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While this solution was crude, and risky, two factors made
                    it seem feasible: spring was imminent, and green Ethernet
                    cable was available. Leif and his colleagues thought they
                    could string the cable through the trees, and nature would
                    take its course to provide camouflage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their rickety fix would therefore do the job and nobody
                    outside IT would ever notice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And the plan worked. Long before the leaves fell later
                    in the year, the office move was complete, and the
                    camouflaged cable was coiled and stowed without anyone being
                    the wiser about trees having made the migration possible.

                    With the help of NIRISS, the researchers mapped the
                    temperature gradients on the planet's dayside. They found
                    that the planet is much cooler near the terminator line:
                    about 1,000 degrees cooler than the hottest point of the
                    planet directly facing the star. That shows that winds are
                    unable to spread heat efficiently to the planet's nightside.
                    What's stopping that from happening?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The lack of winds moving the atmosphere around and
                    regulating the temperature is surprising, and atmospheric
                    drag has something to do with it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The brightness map of WASP-18 b shows a lack of east-west
                    winds that is best matched by models with atmospheric drag,"
                    said co-author Ryan Challener, a post-doctoral researcher at
                    the University of Michigan. "One possible explanation is
                    that this planet has a strong magnetic field, which would be
                    an exciting discovery!"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers were also able to measure the
                    atmosphere's temperature at different depths. Temperatures
                    increased with altitude, sometimes by hundreds of degrees.
                    They also found water vapour at different depths.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At 2,700 Celsius, the heat should tear most water molecules
                    apart. The fact that the JWST was able to spot the remaining
                    water speaks to its sensitivity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Because the water features in this spectrum are so subtle,
                    they were difficult to identify in previous observations.
                    That made it really exciting to finally see water features
                    with these JWST observations," said Anjali Piette, a
                    postdoctoral fellow at the Carnegie Institution for Science
                    and one of the authors of the new research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the JWST was able to reveal more about the star than
                    just its temperature gradients and its water content. The
                    researchers found that the atmosphere contains Vanadium
                    Oxide, Titanium Oxide, and Hydride, a negative ion of
                    hydrogen. Together, those chemicals could combine to give
                    the atmosphere its opacity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "By analyzing WASP-18 b's spectrum, we not only learn
                    about the various molecules that can be found in its
                    atmosphere but also about the way it formed. We find from
                    our observations that WASP-18 b's composition is very
                    similar to that of its star, meaning it most likely formed
                    from the leftover gas that was present just after the star
                    was born," Coulombe said. "Those results are very valuable
                    to get a clear picture of how strange planets like WASP-18
                    b, which have no counterpart in our Solar System, come to
                    exist."

                    The answer came from Wayne Thompson, paleontology
                    collections advisor for the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural
                    History.

                    Thompson determined that the object was a worn molar from an
                    adult Pacific mastodon, an extinct elephant-like species.

                    "I was so excited to get that call," said Liz Broughton, the
                    museum's visitor experience manager. "Jim told us that he
                    had stumbled upon it during one of his regular jogs along
                    the beach, but wasn't sure of what he had found until he saw
                    a picture of the tooth on the news."

                    says mastodons generally roamed California from about 5

                    Instead, NASA should focus on encouraging public collection
                    of data in a more systematic way, and reduce the stigma of
                    reporting UAP: if you see something odd, you're not a loon
                    for letting Uncle Sam know. He even suggested that the
                    agency could develop a mobile app that allows people to
                    submit and share sightings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The current existing data and eyewitness reports alone are
                    insufficient to provide conclusive evidence about the nature
                    and origin of every UAP event," he concluded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "They're often uninformative due to lack of quality control,
                    and data curation. To understand UAP, better targeted data
                    collection, thorough data curation, and robust analyses are
                    needed. Such an approach will help to discern unexplained
                    gap sightings, but even then there's no guarantee that all
                    sightings can be explained."

                    The firm has been tracking Void Rabisu since mid-2022 and
                    believes the gang has added evasion techniques to make it
                    more difficult for security tools to detect the malware. The
                    gang has also used fake websites that appear to promote real
                    or fake software – including ChatGPT, Go To Meeting,
                    AstraChat, KeePass, and Veeam – to entice victims into
                    downloading malicious code.

                    the Ukrainian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA),
                    and Google, "a clear picture emerges of the RomCom
                    backdoor's targets: select Ukrainian targets and allies of
                    Ukraine," the researchers wrote.

                  <p>
                    The report details a February 2023 campaign against targets
                    in Eastern Europe during which miscreants embedded the
                    latest version of RomCom – 3.0 – in an installation package
                    of the AstraChat instant messaging software.

                    While RomCom receives upgrades, its modular architecture
                    remains. Three components - a loader, a network component to
                    communicate with the command-and-control (C2) server, and a
                    worker component that runs the actions on the victim's
                    system - do its dirty work.

                    the current war against Ukraine will accelerate the
                    alignment of the campaigns of threat actors who reside in
                    the same geographic region," the researchers wrote. "This
                    will lead to new challenges for defenders, as attacks can
                    then come from many different angles, and it will be less
                    clear who is the actor responsible for them."

                    Mathematicians from Yorkshire University, the University of
                    Cambridge, the University of Waterloo and the University of
                    Arkansas have one-upped themselves by finding a close
                    relative of "the hat," a unique geometric shape that does
                    not repeat itself when tiled, that is a true chiral
                    aperiodic monotile
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Just three months ago, the same four mathematicians
                    announced what has come to be known in the field as the
                    "einstein" shape—a single shape that could be used for
                    aperiodic tiling all by itself. They called it "the hat."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But others in the field pointed out that the shape
                    described by the team was not, technically, a single
                    aperiodic tile—it and its mirror image are two unique tiles
                    and both are needed to create the shape described by the
                    team. Apparently agreeing with the assessment of their
                    colleagues, the four mathematicians took another look at
                    their shape and found that by slightly modifying it, the
                    need for its mirror would no longer exist and it indeed
                    represented the true einstein shape

                    [...] Unfortunately, while logic circuits continue to shrink
                    with every major step forward in process node technology,
                    analog circuits have barely changed and SRAM is starting to
                    reach a limit too.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While logic still forms the largest portion of the die, the
                    amount of SRAM in today's CPUs and GPUs has significantly
                    grown in recent years. For example, AMD's Vega 20 chip used
                    in its
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techspot.com/review/1789-amd-radeon-vii/"

                    graphics card has a combined total of 5 MB of L1 and L2
                    cache. Just two GPU generations later, the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2151-nvidia-ampere-vs-amd-rdna2/"

                    >
                    has over 130 MB of assorted cache – a remarkable 25 times
                    more than Vega 20.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We can expect these levels to continue to increase as new
                    generations of processors are developed, but with memory not
                    scaling down as well as the logic, it will become
                    increasingly less cost-effective to manufacture all of the
                    circuitry on the same process node.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an ideal world, one would design a die where analog
                    sections are fabricated on the largest and cheapest node,
                    SRAM parts on a much smaller one, and logic reserved for the
                    absolute cutting-edge technology. Unfortunately, this is not
                    practically achievable. However, there exists an alternative
                    approach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Back in 1995, Intel launched a successor to its original P5
                    processor, the Pentium II. What set it apart from the usual
                    fare at that time, was that beneath the plastic shield sat a
                    circuit board housing two chips: the main chip, containing
                    all the processing logic and analog systems, and one or two
                    separate SRAM modules serving as Level 2 cache.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Intel manufactured the primary chip, but the cache was
                    sourced from other firms. This would become fairly standard
                    for desktop PCs in the mid-to-late 1990s, until
                    semiconductor fabrication techniques improved to the point
                    where logic, memory, and analog could all be integrated into
                    the same die.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Intel continued to dabble with multiple chips in the
                    same package, it largely stuck with the so-called
                    <em>monolithic</em> approach for processors – i.e., one chip
                    for everything. For most processors, there was no need for
                    more than one die, as manufacturing techniques were
                    proficient (and affordable) enough to keep it
                    straightforward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For a technology vendor, using heterogeneous
                    integration for a niche product is one thing, but employing
                    it for the majority of their portfolio is another. This is
                    precisely what AMD did with its range of processors. In
                    2017, the semiconductor giant
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techspot.com/review/1345-amd-ryzen-7-1800x-1700x/"
                      >released its Zen architecture</a
                    >
                    in the form of the single-die Ryzen desktop CPU. Several
                    months later, two multi-chip product lines, Threadripper and
                    EPYC, debuted, with the latter boasting up to four dies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With the launch of Zen 2 two years later, AMD fully embraced
                    HI, MCM, SiP – call it what you will. They shifted the
                    majority of the analog systems out of the processor and
                    placed them into a separate die. These were manufactured on
                    a simpler, cheaper process node, while a more advanced one
                    was used for the remaining logic and cache.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And so, <em>chiplets</em> became the buzzword of choice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But if this design choice is so advantageous, why
                    isn't Intel doing it? Why aren't we seeing it being used in
                    other processors, like GPUs?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To address the first question, Intel is indeed adopting the
                    full chiplet route, and it's on track to do so with its next
                    consumer CPU architecture, called
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techspot.com/news/95724-intel-wants-achieve-1-trillion-transistors-package-2030.html"
                      >Meteor Lake</a
                    >. Naturally, Intel's approach is somewhat unique, so let's
                    explore how it differs from AMD's approach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using the term <em>tiles</em> instead of chiplets, this
                    generation of processors will split the previously
                    monolithic design into four separate chips:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    High-speed, low-latency connections are present between the
                    SOC and the other three tiles, and all of them are connected
                    to another die, known as an <em>interposer</em>. This
                    interposer delivers power to each chip and contains the
                    traces between them. The interposer and four tiles are then
                    mounted onto an additional board to allow the whole assembly
                    to be packaged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unlike Intel, AMD does not use any special mounting die but
                    has its own unique connection system, known as
                    <a
                      href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/infinity-architecture"
                      >Infinity Fabric</a
                    >, to handle chiplet data transactions. Power delivery runs
                    through a fairly standard package, and AMD also uses fewer
                    chiplets. So why is Intel's design as such?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One challenge with AMD's approach is that it's not very
                    suitable for the ultra-mobile, low-power sector. This is why
                    AMD still uses monolithic CPUs for that segment. Intel's
                    design allows them to mix and match different tiles to fit a
                    specific need. For example, budget models for affordable
                    laptops can use much smaller tiles everywhere, while AMD
                    only has one size chiplet for each purpose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The downside to Intel's system is that it's complex and
                    expensive to produce, although it's too early to predict how
                    this will affect retail prices. Both CPU firms, however, are
                    fully committed to the chiplet concept. Once every part of
                    the manufacturing chain is engineered around it, costs
                    should decrease.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To continue enhancing chip performance, engineers
                    essentially have two avenues – add more logic, with the
                    necessary memory to support it, and increase internal clock
                    speeds. Regarding the latter, the average CPU hasn't
                    significantly altered in this aspect for years.

                    However, what <em>has</em> changed is the amount of
                    circuitry and SRAM. The aforementioned FX-9590 had 8 cores
                    (and 8 threads) and 8 MB of L3 cache, whereas the 7950X3D
                    boasts 16 cores, 32 threads, and 128 MB of L3 cache. Intel's
                    CPUs have similarly expanded in terms of cores and SRAM.

                    Boeing's Starliner was supposed to fly its first crewed
                    mission to the International Space Station (ISS) on July
                    21st, but a couple of technical issues has kept the company
                    from pushing through with its plan. Together with NASA, the
                    aerospace corporation has

                    that it's delaying the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft's Crew
                    Flight Test date yet again to address the risks presented by
                    two new problems Boeing engineers have detected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first issue lies with the spacecraft's parachute system.
                    Boeing designed the Starliner capsule to float back down to
                    Earth with the help of three parachutes. According to
                    <em>The New York Times</em>, the company discovered that
                    parts of the lines connecting the system to the capsule
                    don't have the ability to tolerate the spacecraft's load in
                    case only two of the three parachutes are deployed
                    correctly. Since the capsule will be carrying human
                    passengers back to our planet, the company has to look at
                    every aspect of its spacecraft to ensure their safety as
                    much as possible. Boeing expects to do another parachute
                    testing before it schedules another launch attempt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to its parachute problem, Boeing is also
                    reassessing the use of a certain tape adhesive to wrap
                    hundreds of feet of wiring. Apparently, the tape could be
                    flammable, so engineers are looking to use another kind of
                    wrapping for areas of the spacecraft with the greatest fire
                    risk.

                    The Crew Flight Test is the last hurdle the company has to
                    overcome to regularly start ferrying astronauts to the ISS.
                    NASA chose Boeing as one of its commercial crew partners
                    along with

                    its industry providers, and emerging issues are not uncommon
                    in human spaceflight especially during development. If you
                    look back two months ago at the work we had ahead of us,
                    it's almost all complete. The combined team is resilient and
                    resolute in their goal of flying crew on Starliner as soon
                    as it is safe to do so. If a schedule adjustment needs to be
                    made in the future, then we will certainly do that as we
                    have done before. We will only fly when we are ready."

                    New houses that rely on dwindling groundwater supplies
                    around one of the United States' biggest cities are to be
                    banned, officials said Thursday, in a sign of the strains
                    that drought and climate change are causing across the US
                    west.

                    Water managers in Arizona say there is a significant
                    shortfall in the Phoenix area, and that any more development
                    in the fast-growing city must rely on other sources of
                    water—such as under-strain rivers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Over a period of 100 years, the Phoenix (area) will
                    experience 4.86 million acre-feet of unmet demand for
                    groundwater supplies," the Arizona Department of Water
                    Resources said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An acre-foot is the amount of water it takes to cover an
                    acre with a foot of water—around 326,000 gallons (1.23
                    million liters)—and is equivalent to around half an
                    Olympic-size swimming pool.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The term 'unmet demand' refers to the amount of groundwater
                    usage that is simulated to remain unfulfilled as a result of
                    wells running dry."

                  <p>
                    The western United States is in the grip of a more-than two-
                    decade drought and a long-term aridification, which
                    scientists say is being exacerbated by human-caused climate
                    change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Major rivers that cross the region, among them the Colorado
                    River, have long been over-exploited, with far more water
                    removed every year than falls as rain or snow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This has led to shrinking reservoirs, including the enormous
                    Lake Mead, which last year dropped to just a quarter of its
                    capacity, threatening "deadpool"—the point where the river
                    downstream dries up and hydroelectric power production
                    ceases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With rivers under pressure, fast-growing population centers
                    have long tapped groundwater to provide water for homes and
                    agriculture, in the form of wells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But this source is easily over-exploited and can in some
                    cases take thousands of years to be replenished.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    State officials said permits already issued for developments
                    in Maricopa County, in which Phoenix sits, will not be
                    rescinded, but developers will have to prove any new
                    applications have a sustainable water source other than
                    groundwater.

                    [...] Scientists say a wet winter in the US West has
                    alleviated some pressure on the system, but this is only a

                    to exacerbate a long-term drying trend.

                    A US Air Force colonel "mis-spoke" when describing an
                    experiment in which an AI-enabled drone opted to attack its
                    operator in order to complete its mission, the service has
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Colonel Tucker Hamilton, chief of AI test and operations in
                    the US Air Force, was speaking at a conference organised by
                    the Royal Aeronautical Society.
                  </p>
                  <p>A report about it went viral.</p>
                  <p>The Air Force says no such experiment took place.</p>
                  <p>
                    In his talk, he had described a virtual scenario in which an
                    AI-enabled drone was repeatedly stopped from completing its
                    task of destroying Surface-to-Air Missile sites by its human
                    operator.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said that in the end, despite having been trained not to
                    kill the operator, the drone destroyed the communication
                    tower so that the operator could no longer communicate with
                    it.

                  <p>
                    "We've never run that experiment, nor would we need to in
                    order to realise that this is a plausible outcome," Col
                    Hamilton later clarified in a statement to the Royal
                    Aeronautical Society.

                    [...] During the industry's early years, every self-driving
                    vehicle had a safety driver behind the wheel. If a car
                    encountered a situation it wasn't sure it could negotiate
                    safely, it would signal to the driver to take over.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once cars went fully driverless, this was no longer an
                    option. Instead, when a Waymo or Cruise vehicle encounters a
                    situation it isn't sure how to handle, it will slow down and
                    stop. Sometimes, the situation will resolve itself and the
                    car can move again on its own. Otherwise, the vehicle phones
                    home and asks for remote guidance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As their technology has matured, Waymo and Cruise have
                    both gradually pushed their services into denser and more
                    chaotic areas. Waymo now serves downtown Phoenix. And as
                    we've seen, it serves Sky Train stations near the airport,
                    if not the airport itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While Waymo and Cruise have steadily improved their
                    technology, the commercial rollout of that tech has been

                    >. Now both Waymo and Cruise are coming under pressure to
                    expand more rapidly.

                  <p>
                    The reason: Projects like Waymo and Cruise are fantastically
                    expensive. GM

                    >
                    that it expected to spend $2 billion on Cruise in 2022.
                    Waymo hasn't disclosed its spending, but with

                      >2,500 employees</a

                    [...] So far, the strategy of avoiding freeways, downtowns,
                    and airports has made Waymo and Cruise safe but
                    unprofitable. Eventually, I expect their software will
                    improve enough that they can operate in these challenging
                    environments safely and confidently. But there's no
                    guarantee this will happen within the next year or two. So
                    the leaders of these companies may come under pressure to
                    push into these more challenging environments before they're
                    ready.

                    [...] I expect some readers have found this article
                    frustrating because I have barely mentioned Tesla's Full
                    Self Driving software, which Tesla fans view as the industry
                    leader. This is because I view Tesla as operating in a
                    different market from Waymo and Cruise. Tesla is building a
                    driver-assistance system that is designed to be used only
                    with direct human oversight, while Waymo and Cruise are
                    trying to build cars that can drive entirely on their own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I think a big reason Tesla fans have a misperception
                    that FSD is ahead of Waymo and Cruise is that Tesla's FSD
                    operates in more situations, including freeways. But that
                    misunderstands what's going on. Waymo has been testing its
                    technology on freeways for more than a decade; it has just
                    been doing it exclusively with safety drivers. Tesla
                    <em>only</em> tests its vehicles with a driver behind the
                    wheel, so of course FSD is able to go on the freeway, too.
                    But this isn't evidence of Tesla's superior performance on
                    freeways; it just reflects Waymo's more cautious approach
                    and different business model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Tesla also isn't laying the necessary groundwork to
                    operate a driverless taxi service. Taxi companies need to
                    develop relationships with taxi regulators, police and
                    firefighters, and other officials in cities where they
                    operate. They also need teams of drivers and mechanics in
                    each city to respond when a driverless taxi gets stranded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As far as I can tell, Tesla hasn't started doing any of
                    this. And that suggests to me that the company isn't serious
                    about entering the driverless taxi business. Rather, Tesla
                    is building a driver-assistance system similar to (if
                    perhaps more advanced than) those offered by other
                    automakers. There's nothing wrong with that. But it means
                    that Tesla isn't a direct competitor to Waymo and Cruise.

                    Platforms remove graphic videos, often using artificial
                    intelligence - but footage that may help prosecutions can be
                    taken down without being archived. Meta and YouTube say they
                    aim to balance their duties to bear witness and protect
                    users from harmful content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Alan Rusbridger, who sits on Meta's Oversight Board,
                    says the industry has been "overcautious" in its moderation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The platforms say they do have exemptions for graphic
                    material when it is in the public interest - but when the
                    BBC attempted to upload footage documenting attacks on
                    civilians in Ukraine, it was swiftly deleted. Artificial
                    intelligence (AI) can remove harmful and illegal content at
                    scale. When it comes to moderating violent images from wars,
                    however, machines lack the nuance to identify human rights
                    violations.

                    Human rights groups say there is an urgent need for social
                    media companies to prevent this information from vanishing.
                    "You can see why they have developed and train their
                    machines to, the moment they see something that looks
                    difficult or traumatic, to take it down," Mr Rusbridger told
                    the BBC. The Meta Oversight Board that he sits on was set up
                    by Mark Zuckerberg and is known as a kind of independent
                    "supreme court" for the company, which owns Facebook and
                    Instagram.

                    "I think the next question for them is how do we develop the
                    machinery, whether that's human or AI, to then make more
                    reasonable decisions," Mr Rusbridger, a former
                    editor-in-chief of the Guardian, adds.

                    for a formal system to gather and safely store deleted
                    content. This would include preserving metadata to help
                    verify the content and prove it hasn't been tampered with.

                    According to the RISE Project, member organizations will
                    contribute to the initiative financially as well as
                    providing the workforce (or "engineering talent") to develop
                    software to fit requirements identified by the RISE
                    Technical Steering Committee (TSC).

                  <p>
                    The intention is that Project members will work with
                    existing open source communities on a "robust software
                    ecosystem" to include development tools, virtualization
                    support, language runtimes, Linux distribution integration,
                    and system firmware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    RISE Project chair Amber Huffman said interest in the open
                    standard has been increasing. A growing number of chips
                    based on the instruction set have also started to market
                    over the past several years, including some focused on the
                    datacenter, such as those announced by Ventana at the end of
                    last year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, this momentum must be supported by adequate
                    software, providing end users with applications that are
                    reliable and commercial-ready, Huffman said.

                    "The RISE Project brings together leaders with a shared

                    readiness in collaboration with RISC-V International," she
                    added.

                    pointed to the "tremendous progress" already made in RISC-V
                    adoption and praised the organizations now coming together
                    under the auspices of RISE to invest in software support for

                    Hiding malicious programs in a computer's UEFI firmware, the
                    deep-seated code that tells a PC how to load its operating
                    system, has become an insidious trick in the toolkit of
                    stealthy hackers. But when a motherboard manufacturer
                    installs its own hidden backdoor in the firmware of millions
                    of computers—and doesn't even put a proper lock on that
                    hidden back entrance—they're practically doing hackers' work
                    for them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at firmware-focused cybersecurity company
                    Eclypsium revealed today that they've discovered a hidden
                    mechanism in the firmware of motherboards sold by the
                    Taiwanese manufacturer Gigabyte, whose components are
                    commonly used in gaming PCs and other high-performance
                    computers. Whenever a computer with the affected Gigabyte
                    motherboard restarts, Eclypsium found, code within the
                    motherboard's firmware invisibly initiates an updater
                    program that runs on the computer and in turn downloads and
                    executes another piece of software.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Eclypsium says the hidden code is meant to be an
                    innocuous tool to keep the motherboard's firmware updated,
                    researchers found that it's implemented insecurely,
                    potentially allowing the mechanism to be hijacked and used
                    to install malware instead of Gigabyte's intended program.
                    And because the updater program is triggered from the
                    computer's firmware, outside its operating system, it's
                    tough for users to remove or even discover.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If you have one of these machines, you have to worry about
                    the fact that it's basically grabbing something from the
                    Internet and running it without you being involved, and
                    hasn't done any of this securely," says John Loucaides, who
                    leads strategy and research at Eclypsium. "The concept of
                    going underneath the end user and taking over their machine
                    doesn't sit well with most people."

                    researchers say are affected. Loucaides adds that users who
                    want to see which motherboard their computer uses can check
                    by going to "Start" in Windows and then "System

                    The system of methylation includes enzymes which modify
                    another protein by adding a small molecule, in this case a
                    methyl group, and 'tagging' it. The addition of methyl
                    groups can affect how some molecules act in the body and
                    changes to the methylation patterns of genes or proteins can
                    influence a person's risk of developing certain diseases,
                    including cancer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is the space that we've been working in experimentally
                    for a very long time," says Prof. Wilkins. "I set out to
                    characterize this particular type of cell modification
                    [methylation], but with a focus on working inside yeast, as
                    a model organism for human and animal cells."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In any methylation process, there is a connection
                    between two proteins (the enzyme carrying the methyl group
                    and the protein being methylated), that make up the core
                    unit of this system. "So if there was more to be discovered,
                    there's essentially going to be an interaction between these
                    two proteins that we don't know about," says Dr. Hamey.

                    "We were able to use the knowledge of this connection to
                    catalog the existing evidence and determine whether there
                    are more of these connections that remain unknown—and if so,

                    in the store. Like, oh I don't know, Google Chrome. After
                    all, if Chrome can get to that site, and it can, then the

                    All that new money could change everything, and there are
                    already big shifts in the battery industry because of it. We
                    can't seem to go more than a few days without an
                    announcement of a new battery factory (most recently, yet

                    [...] To keep global warming below 1.5 °C over preindustrial
                    levels and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we
                    need to reach net-zero emissions around 2050. If we're going
                    to hit that goal, according to the IEA, annual investment
                    needs to reach $4.5 trillion in 2030—nearly triple current
                    spending.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some technologies are actually in great shape. Solar
                    spending just needs to keep growing as it has been for that
                    sector to keep pace with the 2050 goal. But there needs to
                    be much more spending in other areas, especially
                    technologies like energy storage and transmission lines—that
                    will help balance the grid as more solar and other
                    intermittent renewable power sources come online. There's
                    also a huge geographical imbalance, and poorer countries
                    will need a significant boost to help build up their
                    electrical grids and establish new technologies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Investments are broadly on the right track, and I'm excited
                    to see what next year's report will hold. But there's still
                    definitely a long road ahead and a lot of building left to
                    do.

                    As with conventional plastics, though, bioplastics must
                    still be disposed of correctly. But research has found that
                    the labels and instructions on many biodegradable products
                    are often confusing and misleading. In a

                    This could lead to biodegradable and non-biodegradable
                    plastics being disposed of incorrectly. Plastic that is
                    released into the environment may not decompose, and will
                    instead break down into small pieces of microplastic.

                    As the world uses more biodegradable plastic, we need to
                    make sure this material's environmental footprint is
                    minimized. With that in mind, improving labeling and
                    disposal instructions and improving access to industrial
                    composting could all help.

                    which included parents with children at the school, across
                    the street as the robot rolled through the cluster of
                    officers. Serve Robotics told Gizmodo at the time that this
                    incident was the error of a human supervisor trying to
                    reroute the robot around a blockage.

                    If you take someone with intermediate knowledge of computing
                    in the right areas, and ask them how an x86 machine boots,
                    they'll probably start telling you about how the CPU first
                    comes up in real mode and starts executing code from the
                    8086 reset vector of FFFF:FFF0. This understanding of how an
                    x86 machine boots has remained remarkably persistent, as far
                    as I can tell because this basic narrative about the boot
                    process has been handed down from website to website,
                    generation to generation, largely unchanged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's also a pack of lies and hasn't reflected the true
                    nature of the boot process for some time. It's true the 8086
                    reset vector is still used, but only because it's a standard
                    "ABI" for the CPU to transfer control to the BIOS (whether
                    legacy PC BIOS or UEFI BIOS). In reality an awful lot
                    happens before this reset vector starts executing. Aside
                    from people having vaguely heard about the Intel Management
                    Engine, this modern reality of the boot process remains
                    largely unknown. It doesn't help that neither Intel nor AMD
                    have really gone out of their way to actually document what
                    the modern boot process looks like, and large parts of this
                    process are handled by vendor-supplied mystery firmware
                    blobs, which may as well be boxes with "???" written in
                    them. Mainly we have the substantial assistance of assorted
                    reverse engineers and security researchers to thank for the
                    fact that we even have a decent picture of what the modoern
                    x86 boot process actually looks like for both Intel and AMD.
                    I could write a whole article about that process — but
                    instead, I'd like to focus on something else.

                    the final black hole rings like a bell," explains Yanbei
                    Chen (Ph.D. '03), a professor of physics at Caltech and a
                    co-author of both studies. "The quality of the ringing, or
                    its timbre, may be different from the predictions of general
                    relativity if certain theories of quantum gravity are
                    correct. Our methods are designed to look for differences in
                    the quality of this ringdown phase, such as the harmonics
                    and overtones, for example."

                    The first paper, led by Caltech graduate student Dongjun Li,
                    reports a new single equation to describe how black holes
                    would ring within the framework of certain quantum gravity
                    theories, or in what scientists refer to as the
                    beyond-general-relativity regime.

                    <i>Physical Review Letters</i>, led by Caltech graduate
                    student Sizheng Ma, describes a new way to apply Li's
                    equation to actual data acquired by LIGO and its partners in
                    their next observational run. This data analysis approach
                    uses a series of filters to remove features of a black
                    hole's ringing predicted by general relativity, so that
                    potentially subtle, beyond-general-relativity signatures can
                    be revealed.

                    But where does the excess energy accumulate? It accumulates
                    under the form of heat in the different components of the
                    climate system (atmosphere, land, hydrosphere, cryosphere,
                    biosphere). And this is what explains why the Earth is
                    warming, or more globally, climate change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such an inventory corresponding to the period 1960-2020 has
                    been provided by a recently published study. This study
                    shows that the Earth system has been accumulating heat since
                    1971. Moreover, the rate of heat accumulation corresponding
                    to the period 2006-2020 is higher than that corresponding to
                    1971-2020. Most of the excess heat is stored in the ocean
                    (89 percent), mainly in the upper ocean (0-700 metres in
                    depth). The rest of the excess heat is stored in the land
                    (six percent) and the atmosphere (one percent), and has led
                    to the melting of the components of the cryosphere—glaciers,
                    ice sheets and sea ice (four percent).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to storing excess heat, the ocean is also an
                    important CO₂ sink, thus playing an essential role in the
                    regulation of the climate. However, the ocean will become
                    less efficient at capturing CO₂ with the increase in the
                    cumulative emissions of this gas. Why? Because of the
                    positive feedback between the ocean warming and the decrease
                    in the capacity of the oceans to absorb CO₂.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunately, the current state of the ocean is concerning.
                    In 2022, the ocean heat content reached a record high, and
                    58 percent of the ocean surface experienced at least one
                    marine heatwave. Since mid-March this year, the mean ocean
                    surface temperature is the highest ever observed since the
                    beginning of the satellite era. Among other negative impacts
                    on the marine ecosystems, marine heatwaves cause coral
                    bleaching events.

                    All new vehicles will be required to have a "more effective"
                    version of automatic emergency braking (AEB) under a new
                    rule proposed today by the US Department of Transportation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Around 90 percent of light-duty vehicles on the road today
                    come standard with AEB. But the Department of Transportation
                    is proposing a rule that would require automakers to adopt a
                    more robust version of the technology that can stop vehicles
                    traveling at higher speeds and detect vulnerable road users,
                    like cyclists and pedestrians, even at night.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "AEB systems are a big step forward for saving lives on our
                    roadways and preventing crashes," US DOT Deputy Secretary
                    Polly Trottenberg said at a press conference Wednesday.
                    "When deployed, AEB systems can potentially bring a vehicle
                    to a complete halt or at least slow them down so that
                    there's significantly less damage on impact."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2015, a majority of automakers made a voluntary
                    commitment to include AEB as standard in all new vehicles.
                    The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimates that
                    AEB, which uses forward-facing cameras and other sensors to
                    automatically apply the brakes when a crash is imminent,
                    would help prevent 28,000 crashes and 12,000 injuries by
                    2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But now, the Department of Transportation and the National
                    Highway Traffic Safety Administration is ready to go beyond
                    voluntary commitments, proposing a rule that would make AEB
                    mandatory in all new vehicles within four years of the rule
                    going into effect.

                    The nation's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requires
                    airlines to estimate the weight of passengers with one of
                    two options. The first option is to weigh in passengers, as
                    Air New Zealand is doing, or accept the standard weight set
                    by the CAA which is 190 pounds for those 13 years of age and
                    older. The standard weight was last reviewed in 2021 but
                    hasn't been increased since 2004 when the aviation authority
                    increased the average weight from 170 pounds to the current
                    estimated weight.

                    improvement specialist for the airline, said in the press
                    release, "We know stepping on the scales can be daunting. We
                    want to reassure our customers there is no visible display
                    anywhere. No one can see your weight – not even us! It's
                    completely anonymous." He added, "By weighing in, you'll be
                    helping us fly safely and efficiently every time."

                    According to said Standard Model and CERN, around 0.15
                    percent of Higgs bosons should decay into a Z boson and
                    photon, but the data indicates it's actually happening in
                    around 6.6 percent of decays picked up by the Large Hadron
                    Collider. In theoretical models that extend the Standard
                    Model to include other particles the Higgs' Z boson/photon
                    decay rate varies from the 0.15 percent predicted by the
                    standard Standard Model. In other words, something
                    interesting and potentially undiscovered is going on.

                    Of course, there's also the certainty of this discovery to
                    assess, and it's not as sure a thing as the

                    >
                    itself by CERN scientists in 2012. While the Higgs boson's
                    evidence was given a statistical significance of 5-Sigma
                    (roughly equivalent to a one in 3.5 million chance that its
                    discovery was an error), the Z boson/photon decay discovery
                    only rates 3.4-Sigma – still a pretty low chance of being a
                    mistaken observation, but greater than the discovery of the
                    Higgs boson itself.

                    In other words, the science continues with hopes more Higgs
                    observations will help clear things up. "This study is a
                    powerful test of the Standard Model. With the ongoing third
                    run of the LHC and the future High-Luminosity LHC, we will
                    be able to improve the precision of this test and probe ever
                    rarer Higgs decays," said CMS physics coordinator Florencia
                    Canelli.

                Last night, Linode restarted beryllium, the chat server, to do
                emergency maintenance on the host. At the time, I was doing work
                on creating the new staging and development environment and
                didn't think much of it at the time at 3am. Not long after, I
                got notification that the machine was restarting. I went to
                sleep, and put it out of my mind. What I didn't notice, since
                this is the first unexpected reboot in awhile was that there was
                no startup script for the IRCd, due to the migration from CentOS
                6 to Ubuntu 22.04. I got messages via Discord and SMS around 2PM
                EST (that is to say 12 hours later) that the IRC was down, so I
                got back home as quickly as possible and got it restarted.

                I will add "getting someone else beside me onto the backend" on
                the things to do in the very short term.

                    Computex Qualcomm has used its Computex keynote to pitch the
                    ubiquity of its Snapdragon platform as its challenge to x86
                    CPUs as the engine of PCs – by enabling more efficient AI
                    through offloading workloads to a constellation of devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Senior veep and general manager for mobile, compute, and XR
                    Alex Katouzian opened with a humblebrag that people may have
                    a Snapdragon CPU in a PC, smartphone, smartwatch and
                    extended reality glasses. Katouzian then observed rising
                    demand for AI workloads, and made the obvious point that
                    such workloads are very demanding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Speaking before a Computex crowd less than half the size of
                    that which gathered to hear
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/29/nvidia_mgx_spec_computex/"
                      >Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang</a
                    >, Katouzian outlined a plan to have Qualcomm enable AI
                    workloads to move around Snapdragon-powered devices –
                    assuming a user possesses several of them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Offloading AI in this way, he said, will mean XR glasses can
                    become smaller because they can be simpler devices once they
                    offload some AI workloads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kedar Kondap, Qualcomm's senior veep and GM for compute and
                    gaming, pointed out that local devices offer superior
                    performance per watt compared to cloudy datacenters. He
                    therefore predicted that AI workloads will be shared between
                    client devices and clouds – in real time, if doing so
                    enables the best and most efficient experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Qualcomm has
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/19/qualcomm_arm_server_chip/"

                    >
                    in datacenter processors, but the chip shop's reps made no
                    mention of such devices in the keynote. So while Kondap and
                    Katouzian suggested Snapdragon-powered PCs are redefining
                    the category, at this stage Qualcomm appears not to be
                    contemplating a full-stack attack.

                    Individuals identified their household's net worth as
                    positive, zero or negative. Couples with a positive net
                    worth, meaning their combined assets were higher than their
                    combined debts, were more likely to merge finances. Those
                    with a neutral net worth were less likely to combine, and
                    negative net worth did not have a significant impact either
                    way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To me, it was interesting that it wasn't driven primarily
                    by income. It wasn't necessarily the level of debt that
                    mattered, but the net worth," Grable said. "And debt could
                    include credit cards, student loans, auto loans, mortgages,
                    those kinds of things."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers also found that a growing household could push
                    couples toward joint accounts. With a one-person increase in
                    household size, the likelihood of a combined account
                    increased by about 20%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the other hand, individuals with a bachelor's degree or
                    higher level of education were slightly less likely to
                    combine accounts. And couples with multiple income earners
                    were about 50% less likely to pool finances. If both
                    partners have income, they may choose to manage that income
                    alone, researchers said. A non-working partner, however,
                    could face challenges if they could not access any household
                    income.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While this study provided insight into how couples
                    might approach their finances, there is not a hard and fast
                    rule for what financial integration style sets couples up
                    for success. That has to come from communication and seeking
                    out resources or help when issues arise, researchers said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There are so many different ways that couples do this.
                    What's most important is that they find a system that works
                    for them," Kruger said. "But when there is trust and
                    communication, couples can come to a place where they're
                    both happy with how they're managing things."

                    And no wonder: None of the EU's major institutions — the
                    Commission, the European Council or the European Parliament
                    — have Central Europeans at the helm, even as the power
                    balance in Europe shifts eastward after Russia's invasion of
                    Ukraine. Proportional representation in the Parliament also
                    means that the largest countries — France, Germany and Italy
                    — have the most power in terms of votes. Even if all the
                    Nordic, Baltic and Central European countries voted as a
                    block — which they don't — they would still have fewer votes
                    (191) than just France, Germany and Italy (251).

                  <p>
                    As a result, smaller countries then need to prioritize
                    focusing on the most critical issues — defense and security
                    — and the Parliament's ability to set Europe's tech agenda
                    is then

                    But just as the power balance on defense and deterrence is
                    shifting to the east and north, so are the economic
                    headwinds when it comes to tech innovation and investment.

                    more and are still predominantly privately owned — in
                    Western Europe still raise nearly double the amount of money

                    We tend to believe that if our Android phones are lost or
                    stolen, a fingerprint lock will ensure that the sensitive
                    data they hold stays safe. But Chinese researchers have
                    found a way to break through this protection by using a
                    brute-force attack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To protect against brute-force attacks, Android phones
                    usually have safeguards such as limiting the number of
                    attempts a user can make, as well as liveness detection. But
                    the researchers bypassed these by using two zero-day
                    vulnerabilities dubbed Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and
                    Match-After-Lock (MAL).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As per
                    <a
                      href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-phones-are-vulnerable-to-fingerprint-brute-force-attacks/"
                      >Bleeping Computer</a
                    >, it was also discovered that biometric data on the
                    fingerprint sensors' Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
                    lacked comprehensive protection, thereby allowing a
                    man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to steal the fingerprints.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers tested the brute-force attack, called
                    BrutePrint, on ten popular smartphone models. They were able
                    to perform an unlimited number of fingerprint login attempts
                    on the Android and HarmonyOS (Huawei) phones. iOS devices
                    fared much better, allowing just ten additional attempts on
                    the iPhone SE and iPhone 7, bringing the total to 15, which
                    isn't enough for a brute-force attack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The good news is that this isn't the easiest attack to
                    pull off. Not only would someone need physical access to a
                    target phone and a some time, but they'd also require access
                    to a fingerprint database from either biometric data leaks
                    or academic datasets. Some hardware is also required, though
                    it only costs around $15. However, the technique could find
                    use with law enforcement and state-sponsored actors.

                    trying to make it possible to beam solar energy from space.
                    In 2015, the nation made a breakthrough when JAXA scientists
                    successfully beamed 1.8 kilowatts of power, enough energy to
                    power an electric kettle,

                    to a wireless receiver. Now, Japan is poised to bring the
                    technology one step closer to reality.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The project, led by Naoki Shinohara, a Kyoto
                    University professor who has been working on space-based
                    solar energy since 2009, will attempt to deploy a series of
                    small satellites in orbit. Those will then try to beam the
                    solar energy the arrays collect to ground-based receiving
                    stations hundreds of miles away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using orbital solar panels and microwaves to send energy to
                    Earth was first proposed in 1968. Since then, a few
                    countries, including
                    <a
                      href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-18-china-solar-farm-power-station-space-2025.html"
                    ></a>
                    and the US, have spent time and money pursuing the idea. The
                    technology is appealing because orbital solar arrays
                    represent a potentially unlimited renewable energy supply.
                    In space, solar panels can collect energy no matter the time
                    of day, and by using microwaves to beam the power they
                    produce, clouds aren't a concern either. However, even if
                    Japan successfully deploys a set of orbital solar arrays,
                    the tech would still be closer to science fiction than fact.
                    That's because producing an array that can generate 1
                    gigawatt of power – or about the output of one nuclear
                    reactor – would cost about $7 billion with currently
                    available technologies.

                    [...] Tesla may not be able to rest on its laurels for long.
                    "Even for established brands like Tesla, winning the
                    confidence of consumers is vital," says Håkan Lutz, CEO and
                    founder of the EV mini-mobility company Luvly. "Continued
                    safety failings and production delays are leading customers
                    to question whether self-driving vehicles will ever be a
                    reality, and delays to the Cybertruck—announced four years
                    ago—are not doing the company any favors in instilling
                    confidence."

                    Investors seem to have already lost patience. Tesla's share
                    price peaked at $407.36 in 2021 and has since fallen by more
                    than half, closing on May 25, 2023, at $184.47 a share.

                    "Shareholders have been screaming at Musk to get back in the
                    driver's seat for a long time," Schmidt says. "Tesla can't
                    run itself in autopilot mode."

                    [...] One of the actor's primary tactics, techniques, and
                    procedures (TTPs) is living off the land, which uses
                    built-in network administration tools to perform their
                    objectives. This TTP allows the actor to evade detection by
                    blending in with normal Windows system and network
                    activities, avoid endpoint detection and response (EDR)
                    products that would alert on the introduction of third-party
                    applications to the host, and limit the amount of activity
                    that is captured in default logging configurations. Some of
                    the built-in tools this actor uses are: wmic, ntdsutil,
                    netsh, and PowerShell. The advisory provides examples of the
                    actor's commands along with detection signatures to aid
                    network defenders in hunting for this activity.

                    MediaTek's Dimensity 9200 is one of the most powerful
                    smartphone processors of 2023, taking the fight to the
                    Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in a few areas. Now, the Taiwanese
                    chipmaker has shed more light on its next-generation
                    chipset.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    MediaTek announced on Weibo that its next-generation
                    flagship Dimensity chipset would be powered by Arm's newly
                    announced Cortex-X4 CPU core, Cortex-A720 CPU core, and Arm
                    Immortalis Mali-G720 GPU. Check out the accompanying video
                    below(*).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This isn't a surprise, as MediaTek has utilized the latest
                    CPU and GPU tech in its flagship silicon for the past two
                    years. But the news means that you can expect the
                    next-generation Dimensity chipset (presumably called the
                    Dimensity 9300) to be a major rival to the Snapdragon 8 Gen
                    3 processor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Taiwanese chipmaker also noted that the new chipset will
                    offer a "groundbreaking" architecture, adding that the
                    processor will enable improved multitasking and better
                    performance in "heavily" multi-threaded apps and games.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    MediaTek didn't mention whether its new processor will use
                    the brand-new Cortex-A520 little CPU core which debuted
                    alongside the Cortex-X4 and A720. This could be a case of
                    the company not wanting to reveal too many major details
                    right now. It's also theoretically possible (but unlikely)
                    that the new processor simply doesn't have little cores,
                    although we haven't seen a major flagship chipmaker ditch
                    these little cores before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In saying so, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 switched from four
                    little CPU cores to three (adding a fourth medium core
                    instead). Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 leaks also point to the company
                    switching to just two little cores (adding a fifth medium
                    CPU core). So it certainly seems like there's a trend to
                    reduce the number of little cores, but cutting them all
                    together would be an aggressive move and potentially have
                    ramifications for efficiency and multi-core performance.
