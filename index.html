                    Furthermore, the report speculates that such energy could be
                    "propagated with low loss through air for tens to hundreds
                    of meters, and with some loss, through most building
                    materials." This could potentially be done using "commercial
                    off-the-shelf technology" and devices exist that "are easily
                    portable and concealable, and can be powered by standard
                    electricity or batteries," it states.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The report is really interesting but it's also [sort of]
                    funny because it appears to say the exact opposite of what
                    the government just came out and told everybody less than a
                    month ago. On March 1st, Haines told journalists that most
                    cases of Havana Syndrome could likely be attributed to
                    "environmental factors" or "conventional illnesses." The
                    notion that the symptoms would've been caused by a "directed
                    energy weapon" was considered "highly unlikely" in most
                    instances, Haines told the public. While she and other
                    officials left the door open for alternative explanations,
                    the press conference seemed like a clear attempt to shut
                    down further speculation about the bizarre episodes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But far from waving off victims' symptoms as the result of
                    "environmental factors" or some sort of mass delusion, the
                    recently declassified report refers to Havana Syndrome as a
                    "unique neurosensory syndrome" that is "distinctly unusual,"
                    and is "unreported elsewhere in the medical literature."
                    Aside from the "electromagnetic energy" explanation, it also
                    seems to dismiss most of the other theories that have been
                    posited to explain the syndrome's genesis."

                    While prices for computer hardware have remained relatively
                    high in the past few years, the slowing of PC and component
                    sales are starting to take effect. DRAM is the latest piece
                    of hardware to become even cheaper, and projections show
                    that prices will continue to fall in the coming months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to a

                    from TrendForce, DRAM prices have fallen 20% in the first
                    quarter of 2023. This is a continued decline for the DRAM
                    market as sales have been slowing for all sectors of the
                    industry. Some DRAM manufacturers have already
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techspot.com/news/97795-global-dram-market-revenue-hit-2008-lows-fourth.html"

                    >
                    as they see their revenues on a steep decline. For the
                    second quarter of 2023, TrendForce says that prices are
                    expected to fall another 10 to 15%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite production cuts already in effect, PC makers still
                    have between 9 and 13 weeks of DRAM inventory. The mobile
                    sector seems to be having healthier levels of inventory as
                    mobile manufacturers were more conservative in their plans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nonetheless, mobile DRAM pricing is also expected to decline
                    by 10 to 15%. As consumer demand for DRAM was sluggish,
                    suppliers looked to the server side of the business for
                    sales, however this simply resulted in a huge pile-up of
                    inventory for server DRAM.

                    are being sought as a climate solution because they have a
                    smaller carbon footprints than conventional fossil fuels
                    used to power planes. They are made from materials including
                    waste cooking oils, woody debris, manure, algae and crops.

                  <p>
                    One of sustainable aviation fuel's biggest selling points is
                    the fuel can replace jet fuel in existing aircraft, making
                    it a quicker way to cut carbon emissions from flights. Other
                    clean aviation strategies such as electric- or
                    hydrogen-powered aircraft are still being developed and
                    approved by regulators, and the aircraft in the works are
                    smaller planes — not transcontinental jets.

                    Many Washington state companies and institutions have taken
                    steps to support the plant-based fuels.

                    Blanchard says the team was conducting standard experiments
                    designed to better understand the basic properties of
                    liquid-state salts (also known as ionic liquids). The team
                    found that two different room-temperature ionic liquids each
                    generated electricity when a piston squeezed them within a
                    cylinder. The strength of the effect the researchers
                    observed was directly proportional to the force applied.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It shocked the hell out of us to see that," Blanchard says.
                    "Nobody had ever seen the piezoelectric effect in liquids
                    before."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Blanchard and his colleagues found that the optical
                    properties of these ionic liquids could alter dramatically
                    in response to electric current. For instance, when the
                    researchers placed these fluids in a lens-shaped container,
                    they found that an electric charge could modify how much the
                    liquids bent light, "changing the focal length of the lens,"
                    Blanchard says.

                    before the end of 2023. We put a man on the moon in 1969,
                    and now the Finnish Telecom company wants to give the rock

                    helping aid in lunar discoveries, not to mention developing

                    The metaverse was a pet project of former CEO Bob Chapek,
                    who
                    <a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Last November, however, Chapek was unceremoniously
                    dismissed from Disney. And Bob Iger returned to the CEO
                    role, quickly

                    The metaverse ambitions appear to be the latest to be
                    targeted by Iger. Despite the many ideas that were publicly
                    floated, the metaverse unit had apparently not made much
                    progress on the new technology and did not have many clear
                    plans in place.

                    The computer scientist sat down with CBS News this week
                    about his predictions for the advancement of AI. He compared
                    the invention of AI to electricity or the wheel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hinton, who works at Google and the University of Toronto,
                    said that the development of general purpose AI is
                    progressing sooner than people may imagine. General purpose
                    AI is artificial intelligence with several intended and
                    unintended purposes, including speech recognition, answering
                    questions and translation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Until quite recently, I thought it was going to be like 20
                    to 50 years before we have general purpose AI. And now I
                    think it may be 20 years or less," Hinton predicted. Asked
                    specifically the chances of AI "wiping out humanity," Hinton
                    said, "I think it's not inconceivable. That's all I'll say."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Hinton said it was plausible for computers to
                    eventually gain the ability to create ideas to improve
                    themselves.

                    [...] The Webb is so sensitive that it enabled an entirely
                    different sort of observation. Most attempts at imaging
                    exoplanet atmospheres rely on light from the host star that
                    grazes the planets, and thus would pass through any
                    atmosphere that's there. This relies on the planet passing
                    in front of the host star.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This new work relies on the planet passing
                    <em>behind</em> the host star—having the star eclipse the
                    planet, in other words. Shortly before and after that
                    happens, the telescope will receive light from both the star
                    itself and any light that's emitted or reflected by the
                    planet. This sort of "secondary eclipse" is difficult to
                    detect, given that the star is so much brighter. In
                    addition, the Webb's detectors are sensitive to wavelengths
                    that would allow it to detect any carbon dioxide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This initial work focused on the innermost planet,
                    TRAPPIST-1b, where the star would be roughly 1,000 times
                    brighter than any light we should see from the planet. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The work used the drop in light caused by the secondary
                    eclipse to infer what portion of the light outside the
                    eclipse was coming from the planet. This light would be a
                    mix of reflected light and heat given off the planet, which
                    is baked by roughly four times the radiation that Earth
                    receives from the Sun. But, by imaging in the infrared, most
                    of what's being detected is primarily the heat radiated off
                    the planet. By assuming this is approximately a
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation"
                      >black body radiation</a
                    >, it's possible to estimate the temperature of the planet
                    needed to produce that radiation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This produced a result of about 500 K, or 230° C, which
                    tells us there's probably no atmosphere.

                    While the web-tracking pixels ostensibly aim to better
                    pinpoint advertising, they also pose threats for privacy,
                    security experts have said. They can sometimes be configured
                    to collect data that users enter on websites, such as
                    usernames, addresses and other sensitive information. With
                    enough pixels on enough websites, the companies running them
                    can begin to piece together the browsing behavior of
                    individual users as they move from domain to domain,
                    building detailed profiles on their interests and online
                    habits.

                  <p>
                    [...] Beyond TikTok, Feroot also found tracking pixels from
                    Chinese-owned companies such as Tencent Holdings Ltd., which
                    owns WeChat, Weibo Corp., and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. on
                    some state-government websites, as well as Russian-owned
                    pixels from companies such as from cybersecurity company
                    Kaspersky, which had its products banned from civilian and
                    military federal U.S. networks during the Trump
                    administration due to espionage fears.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Feroot found that the average website it studied had
                    more than 13 embedded pixels. Google's were far and away the
                    most common, with 92% of websites examined having some sort
                    of Google tracking pixel embedded. About 50% of the websites
                    the firm examined had Microsoft Corp. or Facebook pixels.
                    TikTok had a presence in less than 10% of sites examined.

                    Privacy advocates have long raised concerns about the
                    proliferation of pixels, whatever their provenance. Alan
                    Butler, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy
                    Information Center, said the data can be used to identify
                    individuals, track them physically and digitally, and
                    subject them to common cybersecurity threats, such as
                    phishing attempts and disinformation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Any social media platform, data broker, or ad service that
                    is using tracking pixels to monitor people's browsing across
                    the web is violating the privacy of users visiting those
                    websites," Mr. Butler said. "This is especially troubling on
                    government websites where individuals are being tracked even
                    as they try to access information and services that are
                    essential."

                    circulating widely in the region, health officials are wary
                    that the virus could easily restart. Rockland has one of the

                    Officials are concerned about the potential for
                    international spread of polio to Rockland's sizable Jewish
                    community during upcoming holiday travel.

                    offering free polio boosters at walk-in clinics, working
                    with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to audit
                    vaccination coverage at day cares and schools, and trying to

                    Neurotechnologies today—devices that can measure and
                    influence our brains and nervous systems—are growing in
                    power and popularity. The neurotech marketplace, according
                    to Precedence Research, is worth USD $14.3 billion this year
                    and will exceed $20 billion within four years. Noninvasive
                    brain-computer interfaces, brain stimulation devices, and
                    brain-monitoring hardware (measuring alertness and attention
                    at work, for example) are no longer just laboratory
                    experiments and technological curios. The societal and legal
                    implications of widespread neurotech adoption may be
                    substantial.

                  <p>
                    Nita Farahany, professor of law and philosophy at Duke
                    University, has written a new book, [...] which explores how
                    our lives may be impacted by the use of brain-computer
                    interfaces and neural monitoring devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Farahany argues that the development and use of neurotech
                    presents a challenge to our current understanding of human
                    rights. Devices designed to measure, record and influence
                    our mental processes, used by us or on us, may infringe on
                    our rights to mental privacy, freedom of thought, and mental
                    self-determination. She calls this collection of freedoms
                    the right to cognitive liberty. Spectrum spoke with Farahany
                    recently about the future and present of neurotech and how
                    to weigh its promises—enhanced capabilities, for instance,
                    including bionics and prosthetics and even a third
                    arm—against its potential to interfere with people's mental
                    sovereignty.

                    (*I say "right now" because in the time between starting and
                    finishing writing this story, Bing changed its answer and
                    now correctly replies that Bard is still live. You can
                    interpret this as showing that these systems are, at least,
                    fixable <em>or</em> that they are so infinitely malleable

                    chatbots are unable to gauge reliable news sources, misread
                    stories about themselves, and misreport on their own
                    capabilities. In this case, the whole thing started because
                    of a single joke comment on Hacker News. Imagine what you
                    could do if you <em>wanted</em> these systems to fail.

                    It's a laughable situation but one with potentially serious
                    consequences. Given the inability of AI language models to
                    reliably sort fact from fiction, their launch online
                    threatens to unleash a rotten trail of misinformation and
                    mistrust across the web, a miasma that is impossible to map
                    completely or debunk authoritatively. All because Microsoft,
                    Google, and OpenAI have decided that market share is more

                    Are you among the few people still using Windows 7, 8, or
                    8.1 and playing games via Steam? If so, you might want to
                    upgrade to a newer version of Microsoft's OS before January
                    1, 2024, as that's the date Valve is terminating Steam
                    support for those older operating systems.

                  <p>
                    Valve made the surprise announcement in a Steam support
                    <a

                      >post</a
                    >. It writes that as of January 1, 2024, Steam will
                    officially stop supporting the Windows 7, Windows 8, and
                    Windows 8.1 operating systems. After that date, the Steam
                    Client will no longer run on those versions of Windows. In
                    order to continue running Steam and any games or other
                    products purchased through Steam, users will need to update
                    to a more recent version of Windows. Or they could always
                    switch to Linux.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Valve's reasoning for dropping Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 is due
                    to Steam relying on an embedded version of Google Chrome,
                    which no longer functions on older versions of Windows. The
                    company adds that future versions of Steam will require
                    Windows feature and security updates only present in Windows
                    10 and above.

                    Valve's decision – assuming they weren't planning on
                    upgrading in the next nine months. The survey results show
                    that 1.43% of participants still use Windows 7 64-bit, while
                    0.34% use Windows 8.1 64-bit and 0.09% use Windows 7.

                    However, in this latest instance, it's believed that nobody

                    the Guardian newspaper, Professor Ernst Wolvetang, from the

                    Queensland which worked with Vow in this project, suggested
                    that it's probably not safe to try the meatball just now,
                    even if regulators permitted it.

                    "We haven't seen this protein for thousands of years,"

                    would react when we eat it. But if we did it again, we could
                    certainly do it in a way that would make it more palatable

                    The new regulation allows the government to ban a particular
                    vendor's spyware from being used by agencies, if the
                    company's product is found to have contributed to human
                    rights violations, has been used to target U.S. citizens, or
                    has been wielded against activists or journalists. In
                    essence, the government is using its presence as a major
                    consumer of defense and security products as a cudgel to
                    encourage surveillance firms to behave or face blacklisting.

                    The announcement comes amidst revelations that more U.S.
                    officials have been targeted by spyware than previously
                    believed. On the same day that the executive order was
                    announced, a senior US administration staffer told reporters
                    that as many as 50 American officials are suspected or
                    confirmed to have been targeted by commercial spyware in
                    recent years. Previous reporting on this subject has focused
                    on a handful of diplomats in foreign countries who had
                    allegedly been targeted for surveillance. The new tally
                    shows that, in reality, the imprint of foreign campaigns
                    aimed at U.S. officials may be much broader.

                    "Commercial spyware – sophisticated and invasive cyber
                    surveillance tools sold by vendors to access electronic
                    devices remotely, extract their content, and manipulate
                    their components, all without the knowledge or consent of
                    the devices' users – has proliferated in recent years with
                    few controls and high risk of abuse," the White House's

                    risks to the United States, including to the safety and

                    AI assistant. The plugins give ChatGPT the ability to
                    interact with the wider world through the Internet,
                    including booking flights, ordering groceries, browsing the
                    web, and more. Plugins are bits of code that tell ChatGPT
                    how to use an external resource on the Internet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Basically, if a developer wants to give ChatGPT the ability
                    to access any network service (for example: "looking up
                    current stock prices") or perform any task controlled by a
                    network service (for example: "ordering pizza through the
                    Internet"), it is now possible, provided it doesn't go
                    against OpenAI's rules.

                  <p>
                    Conventionally, most large language models (LLM) like
                    ChatGPT have been constrained in a bubble, so to speak, only
                    able to interact with the world through text conversations
                    with a user. As OpenAI writes in its introductory

                    >
                    on ChatGPT plugins, "The only thing language models can do
                    out-of-the-box is emit text."

                    Humans are social creatures. But what leads to them being
                    this way? To fully understand how the brain gives rise to
                    social behaviors, we need to investigate it during social
                    encounters. Moreover, we need to analyze not only the
                    internal operations of one brain during social activities
                    but also the dynamic interplay between multiple brains
                    engaged in the same activity. This emerging research field
                    is referred to as "second-person neuroscience" and employs
                    hyperscanning (the simultaneous recording of the activity of
                    multiple brains) as the signature technique.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Now, a research team led by Yasuyo Minagawa of Keio
                    University, Japan, has worked out an elegant solution to
                    this problem. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each pair of participants (39 pairs in total) engaged in a
                    natural, cooperative, and creative task: the design and
                    furnishing of a digital room in a computer game. They were
                    allowed to communicate freely to create a room that
                    satisfied both. The participants also completed the same
                    task alone as the researchers sought to compare
                    between-brain synchronizations (BBSs) and within-brain
                    synchronizations (WBSs) during the individual and
                    cooperative tasks. The social behavior that the team focused
                    on during the tasks was eye gaze, that is, whether the
                    participants directed their gaze at the other's face. They
                    automatically extracted this behavior from the video footage
                    using an open-source software, which made the data analysis
                    easier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the most intriguing findings of the study was that,
                    during cooperative play, there was a strong BBS among the
                    superior and middle temporal regions and specific parts of
                    the prefrontal cortex in the right hemisphere, but little
                    WBS in comparison. Moreover, the BBS synchronization was
                    strongest when one of the participants raised their gaze to
                    look at the other. Interestingly, the situation reversed
                    during individual play, showing increased WBS within the
                    same regions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Minagawa, these results agree with the idea
                    that our brains work as a "two-in-one system" during certain
                    social interactions. "Neuron populations within one brain
                    were activated simultaneously with similar neuron
                    populations in the other brain when the participants
                    cooperated to complete the task, as if the two brains
                    functioned together as a single system for creative
                    problem-solving," she explains. "These phenomena are
                    consistent with the notion of a 'we-mode,' in which
                    interacting agents share their minds in a collective fashion
                    and facilitate interaction by accelerating access to the
                    other's cognition."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, this study provides evidence hinting at the
                    remarkable capability of the human brain to understand and
                    synchronize with others' when the situation calls for it.

                    We don't yet know if the amount of plastic that humans
                    ingest might be enough to shape our microbiomes. People
                    ingest a lot less plastic than seabirds do, says Richard
                    Thompson, a professor of marine biology at the University of
                    Plymouth in the UK. The amount of plastic that gets into our
                    bodies also depends on where we live and work. People who
                    work in textile factories will have a higher exposure than
                    those who work outdoors, for example.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And we don't know the consequences of ingesting microbes
                    that cling to the microplastics that get into our bodies.
                    Humans are already exposed to plenty of disease-causing
                    microbes that aren't on plastics, Thompson points out. For
                    example, we might worry that tiny bits of plastic might pick
                    up nasty bugs in wastewater, and that these might somehow
                    end up in our bodies. But wastewater overflows regularly
                    contaminate beaches and drinking water directly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There's a chance microbes that break down plastic will end
                    up residing in our guts too. It's difficult to know how—or
                    whether—this will affect us. Microbes can evolve quickly,
                    and they can swap genes with neighboring bugs. "Are we going
                    to evolve to eat plastic? My answer would likely be no,"
                    says Fackelmann. But the possibility that our guts will
                    become home to more microbes that can break down plastic is
                    "not beyond the realm of possibility," she says.

                    people. It's not the end of the world: if you normally push
                    and pull to GitHub via SSH – which most people do – then you
                    will have to delete your local GitHub SSH key, and fetch new
                    ones.

                    As the blog post describes, the first symptom is an alarming
                    warning message[.]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For almost everyone, this warning is spurious. It's not that
                    you're being attacked – although that is always a
                    <em>remote</em> (<a

                    >) possibility – it's that GitHub revoked its old keys and
                    published new ones. Hanlon's Razor applies, as it most often
                    does:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately
                    explained by stupidity. (The word <em>stupidity</em> is
                    often replaced with <em>incompetence</em>, but then, one
                    does tend to lead to the other.)

                  <p>
                    This time, the reason was – as usual – plain old human
                    error. Someone published GitHub's
                    <strong>private</strong> RSA keys in a repository on GitHub
                    itself. If you're unclear how SSH encryption works, about
                    public versus private keys, or the different cryptographic
                    algorithms SSH uses, there are many good

                    Researchers used a technique to separate sperm on whether
                    they had an X chromosome (making female offspring) or a Y
                    one (male offspring). Sperm with an X chromosome are
                    slightly heavier than those with a Y, the research
                    indicates.

                  <p>
                    However, the study has again raised long-held concerns over
                    the ethics of such a process. Selecting embryos without
                    reasons such as a sex-linked disease is illegal in many
                    countries.

                    Experts behind the research, from Weill Cornell Medicine in
                    New York, said their technique was inexpensive and
                    "extremely safe".

                    and the technique produced 79.6% male embryos (223 out of

                    The desire to have offspring of a specific sex has a long
                    history but has been particularly present since the 1970s
                    with the early appearance of assisted reproduction. The
                    reasons for choosing a child's sex may be social, such as a
                    desire for family balancing [1]. Couples undergoing IVF, who
                    already have a child or children of one sex, may wish to
                    have the experience of raising children of both sexes. Some
                    couples, who already have children, could have financial
                    reasons for not attempting a further pregnancy without
                    assurance that the additional child will be of a specific
                    sex.

                    Users can remove sensitive information or some other parts
                    of photos, screenshots, and other images by cropping them
                    using the Snipping Tool app. The problem is that for the
                    Windows 11 app – as well as Microsoft's Snip &amp; Sketch
                    cropping tool in Windows 10 – the file of the cropped image
                    still includes the cropped out portions, which can be

                    was found in Google's Markup image-editing app for its Pixel
                    smartphones. According to reverse engineers Simon Aarons and
                    David Buchanan – who named the bug aCropalyse – the problem
                    affects Pixel smartphones since 2018, when the 3 series came
                    out. Google patched its code to avoid leaking cropped areas
                    of images.

                  <p>
                    Then this week, Buchanan confirmed that the Windows Snipping
                    Tool and Snip &amp; Sketch software had the same issue. If a
                    user cropped a photo or other image using the software and
                    then saved the edited image over the original file, that
                    file still contains the cropped-out portion. The area isn't
                    visible when viewing the image using normal tools, but the
                    data is still there in the file, and can be restored and
                    viewed using appropriate recovery software.

                    is made of 3D-printed soft rubber containing shape-memory
                    alloy springs that react to electrical currents by
                    contracting, which causes the actuator to bend. The team
                    used this bistable motion to change the actuator or robot's
                    shape. Once the robot changes shape, it is stable until
                    another electrical charge morphs it back to its previous
                    configuration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The actuators require only a hundred millisecond of
                    electrical charge to change their shape, and they are
                    durable. The team had a person ride a bicycle over one of
                    the actuators a few times and changed their robots' shapes
                    hundreds of times to demonstrate durability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the future, the robots could be used in rescue situations
                    or to interact with sea animals or coral. Using
                    heat-activated springs in the actuators could open up
                    applications in environmental monitoring, haptics, and
                    reconfigurable electronics and communication.

                    Ultimately it depends what you think it means to be an AGI,
                    and how much deeper this particular rabbit hole can go in
                    terms of capabilities developments. All the standard
                    arguments, for and against, apply.

                    Their discussion about how to make it more intelligent
                    involves incremental improvements, and abilities like
                    confidence calibration, long-term memory and continual
                    learning. The rest of the list: Personalization, planning
                    and conceptual leaps, transparency, interpretability and
                    consistency, improvement on cognitive fallacies and
                    irrationality, challenges with sensitivity to inputs.
                    Continual learning does seem like a potential big step in
                    this. Many others seem to involve a confusion between
                    capabilities that cause intelligence, and capabilities that
                    result from intelligence.

                    by four book publishers, deciding that the website does not
                    have the right to scan books and lend them out like a
                    library.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Judge John G. Koeltl decided that the Internet Archive had
                    done nothing more than create "derivative works," and so
                    would have needed authorization from the books' copyright
                    holders — the publishers — before lending them out through
                    its National Emergency Library program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In his ruling, Judge Koetl considered whether the
                    Internet Archive was operating under the principle of Fair
                    Use, which
                    <a
                      href="https://www.eff.org/cases/authors-guild-v-hathitrust"

                    >
                    a digital book preservation project by Google Books and
                    HathiTrust in 2014, among other users. Fair Use considers
                    whether using a copyrighted work is good for the public, how
                    much it'll impact the copyright holder, how much of the work
                    has been copied, and whether the use has "transformed" a
                    copyrighted thing into something new, among other things.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Koetl wrote that any "alleged benefits" from the
                    Internet Archive's library "cannot outweigh the market harm
                    to the publishers," declares that "there is nothing
                    transformative about [Internet Archive's] copying and
                    unauthorized lending," and that copying these books doesn't
                    provide "criticism, commentary, or information about them."
                    He notes that the Google Books use was found
                    "transformative" because it created a searchable database
                    instead of simply publishing copies of books on the
                    internet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Internet Archive says it will continue acting as a
                    library in other ways, despite the decision. "This case does
                    not challenge many of the services we provide with digitized
                    books including interlibrary loan, citation linking, access
                    for the print-disabled, text and data mining, purchasing
                    ebooks, and ongoing donation and preservation of books,"
                    writes Freeland.

                    >, Judge John G. Koeltl declared on Friday the nonprofit had
                    infringed on the group's copyrights by lending out digitally
                    scanned copies of their books.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit originated from the Internet Archive's decision
                    to launch the "National Emergency Library" during the early
                    days of the pandemic. The program saw the organization offer
                    more than 1.4 million free ebooks, including copyrighted
                    works, in response to libraries worldwide closing their
                    doors due to coronavirus lockdown measures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Going into this week's trial, the Internet Archive
                    argued the initiative was protected by the principle of Fair
                    Use, which allows the unlicensed use of copyrighted works
                    under some circumstances. As

                    from The Authors Guild. However, Judge Koeltl rejected the
                    Internet Archive's stance, declaring "there is nothing
                    transformative" about lending unauthorized copies of books.
                    "Although [the Internet Archive] has the right to lend print
                    books it lawfully acquired, it does not have the right to
                    scan those books and lend the digital copies en masse,"

                    What just happened? Linus Tech Tips, one of the largest and
                    most popular technology YouTube channels on the platform,
                    has been hacked. It was used by the hackers to show
                    pre-recorded 'live-streaming' crypto-scam videos, featuring
                    former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The
                    channel is now showing a message stating it has been shut
                    down for violating YouTube's community guidelines, but it
                    appears Linus' other channels are also being abused.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Linus Sebastian's Linus Tech Tips YouTube channel has been
                    running since 2008 and has amassed 15.8 million subscribers.
                    The Canadian has several channels under the Linus Media
                    Group banner, including TechLinked, but the main one remains
                    the most popular. Sadly for all involved, it's become the
                    latest high-profile channel to be hacked.<br />[...]<br />YouTube
                    has shuttered the channel for violating its guidelines, but
                    it seems the hackers have now gone after other Linus Media
                    Group accounts. TechLinked has been renamed Tesla and is
                    showing the same Musk livestream.<br />[...]<br />While all
                    the content from the channels has been deleted, Linus
                    previously created several videos showing off the high-end
                    hardware used to store the terabytes of backups the company
                    created over the years.

                    The last decade or so has seen the creeping techification of

                    shiny gadgets and iterating software releases. They also

                  <p>
                    AutoPacific asked people looking to buy a new vehicle about
                    their interest in 11 different in-car connected features,
                    starting with a data plan for the car for a hypothetical
                    price of $15/month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results may chasten some of the investors demanding that
                    the car companies keep traveling down this path. The most
                    in-demand or desirable feature was Internet connection with
                    a Wi-Fi hotspot—not an unreasonable demand for $15 per
                    month. But only 30 percent of people looking to buy a new
                    car said they were interested in paying for their car's
                    Internet access.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] AutoPacific also broke down some of its data by age
                    brackets. The 30- to 39-year-old group was consistently the
                    most interested in connected subscription features for their
                    cars—28 percent want to stream video directly to the
                    infotainment screen, 20 percent want to play video games on
                    the infotainment screen, and 18 percent want in-car video
                    conferencing. As you might expect, the 60- to 69-year-old
                    bracket was the least interested in any of this stuff; just
                    10 percent would want in-car video streaming, with video
                    conferencing at 5 percent and in-car gaming at just 4
                    percent.

                    [...] The report quotes a former senior employee as saying,
                    "Arm is going to customers and saying, 'We would like to get
                    paid more money for broadly the same thing.' What SoftBank
                    is doing at the moment is testing the market value of the
                    monopoly that Arm has."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If customers decide they don't like Arm's new pricing
                    structure, the competition is getting closer than it ever
                    has before. While Arm is basically a mobile monopoly in
                    everything smaller than a laptop, RISC-V is an upstart
                    project that promises power-efficient chips under a
                    royalty-free open source license. While Arm has an
                    incredible amount of ecosystem support with device designs,
                    a large user base, and a million developer tools, Arm's
                    continual drama is making a switch to RISC-V look more worth
                    the effort with each passing day.

                    Amazon has said it can offer speeds of up to one gigabit per
                    second, and  bandwidth of one terabit per satellite. Those
                    are similar to Starlink's numbers, and the two services seem
                    fairly similar overall. The key difference is that Starlink
                    is operational, and has been for years, whereas Amazon does
                    not plan to start offering Kuiper as a service until the
                    latter half of 2024, giving SpaceX a considerable head start
                    to attract users and secure contracts.

                  <p>
                    There remain concerns, too, about space junk and the impact
                    on ground-based astronomy. Before 2019 there were only about
                    3,000 active satellites in space. SpaceX and Amazon by
                    themselves could increase that number to 20,000 by the end
                    of this decade. Tracking large numbers of moving objects in
                    orbit—and making sure they don't collide with one another—is
                    a headache.

                    Huawei's focus on EDA software for 14nm and larger chips
                    reflects the current state of China's semiconductor
                    industry. State-backed foundry operator SMIC currently
                    possesses the ability to produce 14nm chips at scale,
                    although there have been some reports the company has had
                    success developing a 7nm process node.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To put that in perspective, TSMC and Samsung are currently

                    production of 3nm process tech, while Intel has said it will
                    have a 2nm chip in production by late next year. This puts
                    China's semiconductor industry two to three generations
                    behind that of Taiwan, South Korea, and the US.

                    Blue Origin now has an explanation for the booster failure

                    last September. Jeff Bezos' company has
                    <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/ns-23-findings/"

                    that a "thermo-structural failure" in the NS-23 rocket's
                    engine nozzle was to blame. Operational temperatures for the
                    nozzle climbed higher than expected following cooling system
                    design changes, creating fatigue that misaligned the thrust
                    and activated the crew capsule's escape system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Engineers are already taking "corrective actions" that
                    include redesigning the combustion chamber and operating
                    conditions. Blue Origin has also tweaked the nozzle design
                    to improve its structural integrity. The capsule wasn't
                    damaged and will fly again, Blue Origin says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company says it hopes to resume flights "soon," but
                    hasn't provided an exact date. It intends to restart
                    operations by re-flying the research payload from the
                    aborted mission. The Federal Aviation Administration has to
                    accept the incident findings before Blue Origin can move
                    forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There's plenty of pressure on Blue Origin to address the
                    issues. The company recently obtained a NASA contract to

                    governments and space tourists.

                    Devices used in critical infrastructure are riddled with
                    vulnerabilities that can cause denial of service, allow
                    configuration manipulation, and achieve remote code
                    execution, according to security researchers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers looked at 45 operational technology (OT)
                    product lines used in government, healthcare, water, oil and
                    gas, power generation, manufacturing, retail and other
                    sectors from ten different major vendors. By reverse
                    engineering the products, they were able to identify bad
                    practices like unauthenticated protocols and weak
                    cryptography.
                  </p>

                    From 53 identified CVEs: More than a third (21 CVEs) could
                    facilitate credential compromise. Another 18 CVEs involved
                    data manipulation, with 13 of these allowing firmware
                    manipulation. And 10 CVEs provided a path to remote code
                    execution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Based on open source inquiries (e.g., using the Shodan
                    search engine), the authors determined that a significant
                    number of potentially vulnerable systems are exposed to the
                    internet.

                    The vendors covered included: Bently Nevada, Emerson,
                    Honeywell, JTEKT, Motorola, Omron, Phoenix Contact, Siemens,
                    Yokogawa, and Schneider Electric.

                  <p>
                    "Worryingly, many of these products are certified but suffer
                    from vulnerabilities that should have been caught in the
                    certification process," the researchers say in their paper,
                    citing IEC 62443 labelled products that weren't compliant.
                    "...This suggests that apart from what the standards may not
                    cover, even the things they do cover are not always properly
                    covered in practice."

                    drives in the mail from Quinsaloma. Each of the USB sticks
                    was meant to explode when activated.<br />[...]<br />According
                    to a police official who spoke with AFP, the journalist
                    suffered mild hand and face injuries, and no one else was
                    harmed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to police official Xavier Chango, the flash drive
                    that went off had a 5-volt explosive charge and is thought
                    to have used RDX. Also known as T4, according to the
                    Environmental Protection Agency (<a

                      >PDF</a
                    >), militaries, including the US's, use RDX, which "can be
                    used alone as a base charge for detonators or mixed with
                    other explosives, such as TNT." Chango said it comes in
                    capsules measuring about 1 cm, but only half of it was
                    activated in the drive that Artieda plugged in, which likely
                    saved him some harm.

                  music associated with sleep, such as being quieter and slower

                    Many people say that they listen to music to help them fall
                    asleep, raising the question of whether music chosen for
                    this purpose shares certain universal characteristics.
                    However, research on the characteristics of sleep music is
                    limited, and prior studies have tended to be relatively
                    small.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To better understand the characteristics of sleep music,
                    Scarratt and colleagues analyzed 225,626 tracks from 985
                    playlists on Spotify that are associated with sleep. They
                    used Spotify's API to compare the audio features of the
                    sleep tracks to audio features of music from a dataset
                    representing music in general.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This analysis showed that sleep music tends to be quieter
                    and slower than other music. It also more often lacks lyrics
                    and more often features acoustic instruments. However,
                    despite these trends, the researchers found considerable
                    diversity in the musical features of sleep music,
                    identifying six distinct sub-categories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Three of the sub-categories, including ambient music, align
                    with the typical characteristics identified for sleep music.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, music in the other three subcategories was louder
                    and had a higher degree of energy than average sleep music.
                    These tracks included several popular songs, including
                    "Dynamite" by the band BTS, and "lovely (with Khalid)" by
                    Billie Eilish and Khalid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Overall, this study suggests that there is no
                    "one-size-fits-all" when it comes to the music people choose
                    for sleep. The findings could help inform future development
                    of music-based strategies to help people sleep.

                    Fast-forward to March 2023. On March 4, Florence Débarre, an
                    evolutionary biologist at Sorbonne University in Paris,
                    spotted some data that had been uploaded to GISAID, a
                    website that allows researchers to share genetic data to
                    help them study and track viruses that cause infectious
                    diseases. The data appeared to have been uploaded in June
                    2022. It seemed to have been collected by Gao and his
                    colleagues for their February 2022 study, although it had
                    not been included in the actual paper.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This finding was a really big deal, not because it
                    proves the presence of an infected animal (it doesn't). But
                    it does put animals—raccoon dogs and other susceptible
                    species—into the exact location at the market with the
                    virus. And not with humans," Angela Rasmussen, a virologist
                    at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada and a coauthor
                    of the report, tweeted on March 21.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There's more drama to this story. Débarre and her
                    colleagues say they told Gao's team their findings on March
                    10. The next day, Gao's team's data disappeared from GISAID,
                    and Débarre's team took their findings to the World Health
                    Organization. The WHO convened two meetings to discuss both
                    teams' results with the Scientific Advisory Group for the
                    Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO).

                    who describes himself as an "imaginative tinkerer of
                    shapes," and reported in a paper posted online March 20 at

                    — a bunch of smaller kite shapes stuck together. That's a
                    type of shape that hadn't been studied closely in the search
                    for einsteins, says Chaim Goodman-Strauss of the National
                    Museum of Mathematics in New York City, one of a group of
                    trained mathematicians and computer scientists Smith teamed
                    up with to study the hat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's a surprisingly simple polygon. Before this work, if
                    you'd asked what an einstein would look like,
                    Goodman-Strauss says, "I would've drawn some crazy,
                    squiggly, nasty thing."

                  <p>
                    [...] And the hat isn't the end. Researchers should continue
                    the hunt for additional einsteins, says computer scientist
                    Craig Kaplan of the University of Waterloo in Canada, a
                    coauthor of the study. "Now that we've unlocked the door,
                    hopefully other new shapes will come along."

                    Increasing levels of light pollution means Earth's surface
                    has almost no practical locations for astronomical
                    observatories, a group of astronomers said on Monday.

                    Artificial light emitted from buildings, streetlights, and
                    reflected from satellite constellations are making the night
                    sky brighter for earth-bound skywatchers. The Milky Way was
                    visible to pretty much everyone less than 100 years ago, but
                    is now drowned out by human-made light to most,

                    almost no more remote places available on Earth that
                    simultaneously meet all the characteristics needed to
                    install an observatory (namely, the absence of light
                    pollution, a high number of clear nights, and good seeing),"

                    lawmakers around the world to work together to reach a
                    global agreement to limit artificial light. Light pollution
                    should be treated in the same way that other types of
                    pollutants, like greenhouse gases, they argued. Governments
                    around the world should and can tackle light pollution in
                    the same ways they address climate change: with
                    international treaties and goals to restrict levels of other
                    pollutants.

                    above with satellites and from below with [artificial light

                    cultural heritage of humankind's starry skies," they

                    The study also finds that top earners are more likely to
                    leave smaller city than larger ones, and that these
                    overperformers tend overwhelmingly to move to the largest
                    cities. The disproportionate out-migration of the most
                    successful individuals from smaller cities results in a
                    reinforcement process that takes away many of the most
                    promising people in less populous regions while adding them
                    to larger cities.

                    [...] "Urban science has largely focused on city averages.
                    The established approach just looked at one datapoint per
                    city, for example average income. With their focus on
                    averages, prior studies overlooked the stark inequalities
                    that exist within cities when making predictions about how
                    urban growth affects the life experiences of city dwellers",
                    says Marc Keuschnigg.

                  <p>
                    With respect to urban inequality, the study draws attention
                    to the partial exclusion of most city dwellers from the
                    socioeconomic benefits of growing cities. Their lifestyle,
                    different than among the urban elite, benefits less from
                    geographical location. When accounting for the cost of
                    living in larger cities, many big-city dwellers will in fact
                    be worse off as compared to similar people living in smaller
                    places.

                    [...] With no ground gained, Sanders turned to one final
                    plea in the hearing:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The United States—the people in our country—pay the highest
                    prices in the world for prescription drugs in general...
                    will you at least tell us today that the price you are
                    charging for the vaccine will be lower than what other
                    countries around the world are paying? Or are, once again,
                    we going to pay the highest prices?"

                    Bancel started to respond by noting that health care costs
                    are different in each country before Sanders interrupted and
                    directed him to provide a straight answer, to which Bancel
                    replied: "I cannot say the price will be lower than other

                    With his characteristic humility and word economy, Gordon

                    "my career as an entrepreneur happened quite by accident." A
                    brilliant scientist, business leader and philanthropist,
                    Gordon co-founded and led two pioneering technology
                    enterprises, Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, and, with
                    his wife, Betty, created one of the largest private
                    grantmaking foundations in the U.S., the Gordon and Betty
                    Moore Foundation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He may argue that his career as an entrepreneur happened by
                    accident, but his world-changing contributions did not.
                    Never one to trumpet his own accomplishments, Gordon wasn't
                    able to dissuade others from celebrating his wide and
                    long-reaching legacy: the revolutionary technologies and
                    breakthroughs, a long and generous history of philanthropy,
                    and the very culture of experimentation, invention and
                    relentless progress that now defines Silicon Valley.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It took decades for Gordon to be able to speak with a
                    straight face of his eponymous "Moore's Law," the prophetic
                    1965 observation that became a cornerstone principle of
                    innovation and driving force for the exponential pace of
                    technological progress in the modern world. Gordon later
                    observed that he had looked it up and was pleasantly
                    surprised to find more references on the internet to
                    "Moore's Law" than to "Murphy's Law."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dubbed a "quiet revolutionary" by his biographers, Gordon
                    always worked in the absence of any pretense or desire for
                    recognition, driven instead by an exceptional curiosity,
                    generosity and unassuming commitment to hard work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gordon was always a visionary. Even at the start of his
                    career, he keenly recognized the impact that the
                    technologies he was developing would have on the world. And
                    at an industry event in 1979, he told an Intel audience: "We
                    are bringing about the next great revolution in the history
                    of mankind — the transition to the electronic age." (<em
                      >Moore's Law</em
                    >, Thackray, Brock and Jones).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although Gordon was reluctant to spotlight his own
                    contributions, his biographers have been less reticent about
                    attribution. Gordon is simply, they argue, "the most
                    important thinker and doer in the story of silicon
                    electronics."

                    Chocolate bars, crisps and fries - why can't we just ignore
                    them in the supermarket? Researchers at the Max Planck
                    Institute for Metabolism Research in Cologne, in
                    collaboration with Yale University, have now shown that
                    foods with a high fat and sugar content change our brain: If
                    we regularly eat even small amounts of them, the brain
                    learns to consume precisely these foods in the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To test this hypothesis, the researchers gave one
                    group of volunteers a small pudding containing a lot of fat
                    and sugar per day for eight weeks in addition to their
                    normal diet. The other group received a pudding that
                    contained the same number of calories but less fat. The
                    volunteer's brain activity was measured before and during
                    the eight weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The brain's response to high-fat and high-sugar foods was
                    greatly increased in the group that ate the high-sugar and
                    high-fat pudding after eight weeks. This particularly
                    activated the dopaminergic system, the region in the brain
                    responsible for motivation and reward. "Our measurements of
                    brain activity showed that the brain rewires itself through
                    the consumption of chips and co. It subconsciously learns to
                    prefer rewarding food. Through these changes in the brain,
                    we will unconsciously always prefer the foods that contain a
                    lot of fat and sugar," explains Marc Tittgemeyer, who led
                    the study.

                    that's becoming more and more common on the road, even if it
                    does still upset the occasional Mustangophile. And there's
                    an electric Transit van for the trades. But its electric
                    vehicle division will lose $3 billion this year as it
                    continues to build new factories and buy raw materials.

                    morning.

                      >As we reported last year</a
                    >, Ford has split its passenger vehicle operations into two
                    divisions. Electric vehicles fall under Ford Model e, with
                    internal combustion engine-powered Fords (including hybrids
                    and plug-in hybrids) falling under Ford Blue. The move was
                    in large part to placate investors and analysts, no doubt
                    starry-eyed during a time when any EV-related stock was

                    [...] The drone used in this research is made by a company
                    called Voliro, and it's a tricopter that uses rotating
                    thruster nacelles that move independently of the body of the
                    drone. It may not shock you to learn that Voliro (which has,
                    in the past, made some really weird flying robots) is a
                    startup with its roots in the Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH
                    Zurich, the same place where the mine-detecting drone
                    research is taking place.

                    [...] Testing with metallic (nonexplosive) targets showed
                    that this system does very well, even in areas with
                    obstacles, overhead occlusion, and significant slope.
                    Whether it's ultimately field-useful or not will require
                    some further investigation, but because the platform itself
                    is commercial, off-the-shelf hardware, there's a bit more
                    room for optimism than there otherwise might be.

                    While programmers today take multiplication for granted,
                    most microprocessors in the 1970s could only add and
                    subtract — multiplication required a slow and tedious loop
                    implemented in assembly code. One of the nice features of
                    the Intel 8086 processor (1978) was that it provided machine
                    instructions for multiplication,2 able to multiply 8-bit or
                    16-bit numbers with a single instruction. Internally, the
                    8086 still performed a loop, but the loop was implemented in
                    microcode: faster and transparent to the programmer. Even
                    so, multiplication was a slow operation, about 24 to 30
                    times slower than addition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this blog post, I explain the multiplication process
                    inside the 8086, analyze the microcode that it used, and
                    discuss the hardware circuitry that helped it out.3 My
                    analysis is based on reverse-engineering the 8086 from die
                    photos. The die photo below shows the chip under a
                    microscope. I've labeled the key functional blocks; the ones
                    that are important to this post are darker. At the left, the
                    ALU (Arithmetic/Logic Unit) performs the arithmetic
                    operations at the heart of multiplication: addition and
                    shifts. Multiplication also uses a few other hardware
                    features: the X register, the F1 flag, and a loop counter.
