                    At least 100 instances of malicious AI ML models were found
                    on the Hugging Face platform, some of which can execute code
                    on the victim's machine, giving attackers a persistent
                    backdoor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hugging Face is a tech firm engaged in artificial
                    intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), and
                    machine learning (ML), providing a platform where
                    communities can collaborate and share models, datasets, and
                    complete applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    JFrog's security team found that roughly a hundred models
                    hosted on the platform feature malicious functionality,
                    posing a significant risk of data breaches and espionage
                    attacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This happens despite Hugging Face's security measures,
                    including malware, pickle, and secrets scanning, and
                    scrutinizing the models' functionality to discover behaviors
                    like unsafe deserialization.

                    Today is February 29, an unusual day in that it is added to
                    the common 28 in years that are multiples of four to keep
                    the calendar in sync with the astronomical year.

                    This kludge prevents our seasons from drifting out of whack,
                    but it presents a problem for computers and software, which
                    have to be programmed to account for the extra day to avoid
                    error conditions and incorrect data.

                    We are all using a computer of one sort or another to read
                    this and hopefully nothing has caught fire, yet every leap
                    year, something somewhere falls over hard.

                    OpenAI said in a filing in Manhattan federal court on Monday
                    that the Times caused the technology to reproduce its
                    material through "deceptive prompts that blatantly violate
                    OpenAI's terms of use."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The allegations in the Times's complaint do not meet its
                    famously rigorous journalistic standards," OpenAI said. "The
                    truth, which will come out in the course of this case, is
                    that the Times paid someone to hack OpenAI's products."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    OpenAI did not name the "hired gun" who it said the Times
                    used to manipulate its systems and did not accuse the
                    newspaper of breaking any anti-hacking laws.

                    whether AI training qualifies as fair use under copyright
                    law. So far, judges have dismissed some infringement claims
                    over the output of generative AI systems based on a lack of
                    evidence that AI-created content resembles copyrighted
                    works.

                    Evolution has produced a wondrously diverse variety of
                    lifeforms here on Earth. It just so happens that talking
                    primates with opposable thumbs rose to the top and are
                    building a spacefaring civilization. And we're
                    land-dwellers. But what about other planets? If the dominant
                    species on an ocean world builds a technological
                    civilization of some sort, would they be able to escape
                    their ocean home and explore space?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A new article in the Journal of the British Interplanetary
                    Society examines the idea of civilizations on other worlds
                    and the factors that govern their ability to explore their
                    solar systems. Its title is "<a

                    >." The sole author is Elio Quiroga, a professor at the
                    Universidad del Atlántico Medio in Spain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We have no way of knowing if other Extraterrestrial
                    Intelligences (ETIs) exist or not. There's at least some
                    possibility that other civilizations exist, and we're
                    certainly in no position to say for sure that they don't.
                    The Drake Equation is one of the tools we use to talk about
                    the existence of ETIs. It's a kind of structured thought
                    experiment in the form of an equation that allows us to
                    estimate the existence of other active, communicative ETIs.
                    Some of the variables in the Drake Equation (DE) are the
                    star formation rate, the number of planets around those
                    stars, and the fraction of planets that could form life and
                    on which life could evolve to become an ETI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In his new research article, Quiroga comes up with two new
                    concepts that feed into the DE: the Exoplanet Escape Factor
                    and Fishbowl worlds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Quiroga's Exoplanet Escape Factor (Fex) can help us
                    imagine what kinds of worlds could host ETIs. It can help us
                    anticipate the factors that prevent or at least inhibit
                    space travel, and it brings more complexity into the Drake
                    Equation. It leads us to the idea of Fishbowl Worlds,
                    inescapable planets that could keep a civilization
                    planet-bound forever.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Without the ability to ever escape their planet and explore
                    their solar systems, and without the ability to communicate
                    beyond their worlds, could entire civilizations rise and
                    fall without ever knowing the Universe they were a part of?
                    Could it happen right under our noses, so to speak, and we'd
                    never know ?

                  <p>
                    At a time when one viral video can damage a business, some
                    companies are turning to their own commenting platforms
                    rather than letting social media be the main outlet for
                    customer feedback. Only one wrinkle: in this context,
                    customers appear to prefer writing a message rather than
                    leaving a video.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a recent study, more participants indicated they would
                    likely leave written compliments or complaints about service
                    on a restaurant-provided tablet powered by artificial
                    intelligence. A video message option appeared to discourage
                    leaving feedback.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With more restaurants and hotels turning to AI to enhance
                    their service, the findings indicate that methods that
                    require "low self-disclosure" would work better, meaning
                    ones that don't require customers to provide very much
                    identifiable information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Some restaurants and hotels actually ask customers to
                    create video testimonials that they can share, but for
                    general customers, it seems they still feel more comfortable
                    with low self-disclosure. This is probably because people
                    still do not trust AI to that level," said lead author
                    Ruiying Cai, a researcher in Washington State University's
                    Carson College of Business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With a lot of hype around AI technology, many people have
                    misperceptions about what it can do, Cai pointed out,
                    perhaps believing it is capable of a lot more than simply
                    recording a message.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study participants reported being concerned about what
                    would be done with their information in all the scenarios,
                    but this was heightened with the option to leave a video.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers found that the participants were more
                    willing to give feedback using text, whether positive or
                    negative.

                    harmony with local melodies from the Middle East, India, and
                    other parts of the world. That can be more or less
                    successful, but one problem is that notes can sound
                    dissonant if you play them with Western instruments."

                    specially chosen real or synthesized instruments. Then they

                    A day after American fast food chain Wendy's announced plans
                    to test dynamic pricing and AI menu features in 2025, the
                    company clarified its plans.

                  <p>
                    Wendy's said it will not dynamically raise menu prices based
                    on demand after reports about the experiment, which was set
                    to roll out in 2025, caused a stir online. In a statement to

                      >Reuters</a
                    >, a Wendy's spokesperson said it "would not raise prices
                    when our customers are visiting us most." Instead, the
                    company framed experimental price changes as discounts
                    during "slower times of day."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We said these menuboards would give us more flexibility to
                    change the display of featured items. This was misconstrued
                    in some media reports as an intent to raise prices when
                    demand is highest," the company told Reuters. "We have no
                    plans to do that."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Presuming that lowered prices during slow times will
                    eventually rise again, it appears some sort of dynamic
                    pricing will still be taking place.

                    throughout the day depending on demand, similar to "surge

                    president of Wendy's, in a recent discussion with analysts.

                    [...] In conversation with Food &amp; Wine, a spokesperson
                    for Wendy's confirmed the company's commitment to this
                    pricing strategy, describing it as part of a broader effort
                    to grow its digital business. "Beginning as early as 2025,
                    we will begin testing a variety of enhanced features on
                    these digital menuboards like dynamic pricing, different
                    offerings in certain parts of the day, AI-enabled menu
                    changes and suggestive selling based on factors such as
                    weather," they said. "Dynamic pricing can allow Wendy's to
                    be competitive and flexible with pricing, motivate customers
                    to visit and provide them with the food they love at a great
                    value. We will test a number of features that we think will
                    provide an enhanced customer and crew experience."

                [Ed's comment: The linked source is obviously intended to show a
                potential user how it will work, and in this role it does a
                reasonable job. But there is not a great deal to explain why
                they think it is a game changer, or why it will appeal to many
                users. If it is necessary to use Lisp to extend the browser then
                perhaps it will not have the impact that they seem to believe it
                will have. But what do you think? Will it gain a foothold, or
                simply fade away to be forgotten except perhaps for a few
                enthusiasts?]

                    The Expert Panel observed a disconnect between Boeing's
                    senior management and other members of the organization on
                    safety culture. Interviewees, including ODA [Organization
                    Designation Authorization] (ODA)Unit Members (UM), also
                    questioned whether Boeing's safety reporting systems would
                    function in a way that ensures open communication and
                    non-retaliation. The Expert Panel also observed inadequate
                    and confusing implementation of the five components of a
                    positive safety culture [....]

                    [....] Boeing safety management systems (SMS) procedures are
                    not structured in a way that ensures all employees
                    understand their role in the company's SMS. The procedures
                    and training are complex and in a constant state of change,
                    creating employee confusion especially among different work
                    sites and employee groups. The Expert Panel also found a
                    lack of awareness of safety-related metrics at all levels of
                    the organization; employees had difficulty distinguishing
                    the differences among various measuring methods, their
                    purpose, and outcomes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Boeing's restructuring of the management of the ODA unit
                    decreased opportunities for interference and retaliation
                    against UMs, and provides effective organizational messaging
                    regarding independence of UMs. However, the restructuring,
                    while better, still allows opportunities for retaliation to
                    occur, particularly with regards to salary and furlough
                    ranking. This influences the ability of UMs to execute their
                    delegated functions effectively.

                    rocket that launched a climate satellite in 2009. Weighing
                    three metric tons and as big as a bus, it orbits our planet
                    at an altitude of 600 kilometers (373 miles). If left
                    untended it will remain in orbit for decades, says Lewis,

                    back into the atmosphere. At that point it will burn up,

                    ADRAS-J's mission is to figure out how to pull it back into

                    "Designing a servicer to go up and grapple a three-ton piece
                    of debris comes with a lot of challenges," says Mike
                    Lindsay, Astroscale's chief technology officer. "The biggest
                    challenge is dealing with the amount of uncertainty. The
                    object has been up there for 15 years. It's uncontrolled.
                    We're not communicating with it. So we don't know how it's
                    moving, how it looks, and how it's aged."

                      >spun back out</a
                    >. Today Reddit approaches the public markets with more than
                    $800 million worth of revenue in 2023, up from $666.7
                    million in 2022.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the company remains unprofitable on both a GAAP and
                    adjusted basis, and continues to consume cash to fund its
                    operations. Scale has not yet solved the profitability
                    question for Reddit, which could limit its potential
                    valuation when it does list its shares.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2022, Reddit generated a net loss of $158.6 million and
                    had an adjusted EBITDA of negative $108.4 million. In 2023,
                    those figures improved to a $90.8 million net loss and $69.3
                    million worth of negative adjusted EBITDA. The company's
                    free cash flow improved from –$100.3 million to –$84.8
                    million over the same timeframe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company may be making progress toward stemming the red
                    ink that is missed in its annual figures. In the final
                    quarter of 2023, Reddit not only posted what was at least a
                    local maximum in revenue terms — $249.8 million — but also a
                    net profit of $18.5 million. While the GAAP profit is
                    notable for the fourth quarter, the company's free cash flow
                    was still negative in the period, ending the three-month
                    period at –$22 million.

                    Reddit raised more than $1 billion while private,

                    while its Series F took it to a roughly $10 billion
                    valuation.

                    Both of those bubble-era valuations will be tested in
                    Reddit's now quickly forthcoming IPO. But the company's
                    debut will be more than a test for certain private-market
                    startup valuations. Reddit is reportedly trying something
                    novel in its own flotation.

                    In what is broadly viewed as an unorthodox move, Reddit
                    reportedly plans to reserve an undetermined number of shares
                    for 75,000 of its users, according to the

                    >, which cited people familiar with the matter. Those users
                    will be given the chance to scoop up shares of Reddit at its
                    IPO price before the stock even begins trading — something
                    typically reserved only for large investors.

                    [....] In seeking ways to optimize classical computing, Sels
                    and his colleagues at the Simons Foundation focused on a
                    type of tensor network that faithfully represents the
                    interactions between the qubits. Those types of networks
                    have been notoriously hard to deal with, but recent advances
                    in the field now allow these networks to be optimized with
                    tools borrowed from statistical inference.

                    The authors compare the work of the algorithm to the
                    compression of an image into a JPEG file, which allows large
                    images to be stored using less space by eliminating
                    information with barely perceivable loss in the quality of
                    the image.

                    Altermagnets have a special combination of the arrangement
                    of spins and crystal symmetries. The spins alternate, as in
                    antiferromagnets, resulting in no net magnetisation. Yet,
                    rather than simply cancelling out, the symmetries give an
                    electronic band structure with strong spin polarization that
                    flips in direction as you pass through the material's energy
                    bands -- hence the name altermagnets. This results in highly
                    useful properties more resemblant of ferromagnets, as well
                    as some completely new properties.

                Spintronics has promised to revolutionise IT. Typically,
                ferromagnets have been used as they offer highly desirable,
                strong, spin-dependent physical phenomena. Yet the macroscopic
                net magnetisation that is useful in so many other applications
                poses practical limitations on the scalability of these devices
                as it causes crosstalk between bits. Instead, Antiferromagnets
                have been investigated for spintronics, as they have no net
                magnetisation and thus offer ultra-scalability and energy
                efficiency. However, the strong spin-dependent effects are
                lacking, again hindering their practical applicability.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enter altermagnets with the best of both: zero net magnetisation
                together with the coveted strong spin-dependent phenomena
                typically found in ferromagnets -- merits that were regarded as
                principally incompatible.

                    The researchers believe that this new fundamental discovery
                    in magnetism will enrich our understanding of
                    condensed-matter physics, with impact across diverse areas
                    of research and technology. As well as its advantages to the
                    developing field of spintronics, it also offers a promising
                    platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity,
                    through new insights into superconducting states that can
                    arise in different magnetic materials.

                    in front of our eyes for decades without noticing it," says
                    Jungwirth. "And it is not something that exists only in a
                    few obscure materials. It exists in many crystals that
                    people simply had in their drawers. In that sense, now that
                    we have brought it to light, many people around the world
                    will be able to work on it, giving the potential for a broad

                    People who quit smoking see major gains in life expectancy
                    after just a few years, according to a new study by
                    University of Toronto researchers at
                    <a href="https://unityhealth.to/">Unity Health Toronto</a>.

                      >study</a
                    >, published in <em>NEJM Evidence</em>, shows that smokers
                    who quit smoking before age 40 can expect to live almost as
                    long as those who never smoked. Those who quit at any age
                    return close to never-smoker survival 10 years after
                    quitting, and about half that benefit occurs within just
                    three years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Former smokers lowered their risk of death to 1.3-fold
                    (or 30 per cent higher) compared to never smokers. Stopping
                    smoking at any age was associated with longer survival, and
                    even those who quit for less than three years gained up to
                    six years in life expectancy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Many people think it's too late to quit smoking, especially
                    in middle age," said Jha. "But these results counter that
                    line of thought. It's never too late, the impact is fast and
                    you can reduce risk across major diseases, meaning a longer
                    and better quality of life."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers found that quitting smoking reduced the risk
                    of dying from vascular disease and cancer, in particular.
                    Former smokers also reduced their risk of death from
                    respiratory disease, but slightly less so, likely due to
                    residual lung damage.

                    It may not be super easy to get to: "Most hydrogen is likely
                    inaccessible," Ellis told the <em>Financial Times</em>. "But
                    a few per cent recovery would still supply all projected
                    demand – 500 million tonnes a year – for hundreds of years."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gold hydrogen won't won't hog renewable energy like
                    electrolyzers, or divert it away from other decarbonization
                    opportunities. In that sense, you could argue it'll have the
                    potential to be significantly greener than green hydrogen.
                    On the other hand, if tapping it releases methane into the
                    atmosphere, that's a serious issue; methane is around 85
                    times more powerful a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide
                    over a 20-year time frame.

                    To comply with looming rules that ban tech giants from

                    products in Europe. The

                    is supposed to help smaller companies get more traffic from
                    Google, but reviews service Yelp says that when it tested
                    Google's design tweaks with consumers it had the opposite
                    effect—making people <i>less</i> likely to click through to
                    Yelp or another Google competitor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results, which Yelp shared with European regulators in
                    December and WIRED this month, put some numerical backing
                    behind complaints from Google rivals in travel, shopping,
                    and hospitality that its efforts to comply with

                    are insufficient—and potentially more harmful than the
                    status quo. Yelp and thousands of others have been demanding
                    that the EU hold a firm line against the giant companies
                    including Apple and Amazon that are subject to what's widely
                    considered the world's strictest antitrust law, violations
                    of which can draw fines of up to 10 percent of global annual
                    sales.

                    "All the gatekeepers are trying to hold on as long as
                    possible to the status quo and make the new world
                    unattractive," says Richard Stables, CEO of shopping
                    comparison site Kelkoo, which is unhappy with how Google has
                    tweaked shopping results to comply with the DMA. "That's
                    really the game plan."

                  <p>
                    Google spokesperson Rory O'Donoghue says the more than 20
                    changes made to search in response to the DMA are providing
                    more opportunities for services such as Yelp to show up in
                    results. "To suggest otherwise is plain wrong," he says.
                    Overall, Google's tests of various DMA-inspired designs show
                    clicks to review and comparison websites are up, O'Donoghue
                    says—at the cost of users losing shortcuts to Google tools
                    and individual businesses like airlines and restaurants
                    facing a drop in visits from Google search. "We've been
                    seeking feedback from a range of stakeholders over many
                    months as we try to balance the needs of different types of
                    websites while complying with the law," he says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google, which generates 30 percent of its sales from Europe,
                    the Middle East, and Africa, views the DMA as disrespecting
                    its expertise in what users want. Critics such as Yelp argue
                    that Google sometimes siphons users away from the more
                    reliable content they offer. Yelp competes with Google for
                    advertisers but generated less than 1 percent of its record
                    sales of $1.3 billion last year from outside the US. An
                    increase in European traffic could significantly boost its
                    business.

                    sent today to US Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). Khan's letter
                    said the access was limited because employees refused to
                    comply with Musk's demands:

                      <p>
                        The deposition testimony revealed that in early December
                        2022, Elon Musk had reportedly directed staff to grant
                        an outside third-party individual "full access to
                        everything at Twitter... No limits at all." Consistent
                        with Musk's direction, the individual was initially
                        assigned a company laptop and internal account, with the
                        intent that the third-party individual be given
                        "elevated privileges" beyond what an average company
                        employee might have.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        However, based on a concern that such an arrangement
                        would risk exposing nonpublic user information in
                        potential violation of the FTC's Order, longtime
                        information security employees at Twitter intervened and
                        implemented safeguards to mitigate the risks. Ultimately
                        the third-party individuals did not receive direct
                        access to Twitter's systems, but instead worked with
                        other company employees who accessed the systems on the
                        individuals' behalf.

                    that "the FTC harassed Twitter in the wake of Mr. Musk's
                    acquisition." Khan's letter to Jordan today argues that the
                    FTC investigation was justified.
                  </p>

                    "The FTC's investigation confirmed that staff was right to
                    be concerned, given that Twitter's new CEO had directed
                    employees to take actions that would have violated the FTC's
                    Order," Khan wrote. "Once staff learned that the FTC's Order
                    had worked to ensure that Twitter employees took appropriate
                    measures to protect consumers' private information,

                    Occasionally when Signal is in the press and getting a lot
                    of favorable discussion, I feel the need to step into
                    various forums, IRC channels, and so on, and explain why I
                    don't trust Signal. Let's do a blog post instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Off the bat, let me explain that I expect a tool which
                    claims to be secure to actually be secure. I don't view "but
                    that makes it harder for the average person" as an
                    acceptable excuse. If Edward Snowden and Bruce Schneier are
                    going to spout the virtues of the app, I expect it to
                    <em>actually</em> be secure when it matters - when
                    vulnerable people using it to encrypt sensitive
                    communications are targeted by smart and powerful
                    adversaries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Making promises about security without explaining the
                    tradeoffs you made in order to appeal to the average user is
                    unethical. Tradeoffs are necessary - but self-serving
                    tradeoffs are not, and it's your responsibility to clearly
                    explain the drawbacks and advantages of the tradeoffs you
                    make. If you make broad and inaccurate statements about your
                    communications product being "secure", then when the
                    political prisoners who believed you are being tortured and
                    hanged, it's on you. The stakes are serious. Let me explain
                    why I don't think Signal takes them seriously.

                    Amphisbaenians are strange creatures. Like worms with
                    vertebrae, scales, a large central tooth and sometimes small
                    forearms, these reptiles live underground, burrowing tunnels
                    and preying on just about anything they encounter, not
                    unlike a miniature version of the monstrous sandworms from
                    "Dune."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even though they're found around much of the world, little
                    is known about how amphisbaenians behave in the wild because
                    they cannot be observed while in their natural habitat under
                    sand and soil. But thanks to two papers published in the
                    March issue of The Anatomical Record, new light is being
                    shed on these animals and their specialized anatomy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "You could fit three skulls of the Zygaspis
                    quadrifrons on the nail of my pinky. We can now look at
                    these really small vertebrate organisms in a measure of
                    detail that we never had before," Bell said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "They wriggle around and try to escape and move in
                    ways that worms just aren't able to. These are much more
                    like little snakes in the way that they move and interact.
                    It's just surprising for something that's so tiny. You just
                    don't expect that behavior," Lewis said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some of the most striking imagery to come from these CT
                    scans highlights sutures within the skull: deep, thin waves
                    that "grab" on to each other, Lewis described. The images
                    also render in exquisite details the amphisbaenians' strange
                    singular central tooth, which interlocks with two bottom
                    teeth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Combined with the powerful jaw muscles in amphisbaenians,
                    it gives them a ferocious bite for an animal of their size.
                    They can bite and tear out pieces of their prey," Bell said.

                    I've written before about my nostalgia for the Windows XP-
                    or Windows 7-era "clean install," when you could
                    substantially improve any given pre-made PC merely by taking
                    an official direct-from-Microsoft Windows install disk and
                    blowing away the factory install, ridding yourself of 60-day
                    antivirus trials, WildTangent games, outdated drivers, and
                    whatever other software your PC maker threw on it to help
                    subsidize its cost.

                    You can still do that with Windows 11—in fact, it's
                    considerably easier than it was in those '00s versions of
                    Windows, with multiple official Microsoft-sanctioned ways to
                    download and create an install disk, something you used to
                    need to acquire on your own. But the resulting Windows
                    installation is a lot less "clean" than it used to be, given
                    the continual creep of new Microsoft apps and services into
                    more and more parts of the core Windows experience. [...]

                I am a long-time macOS user, and willingly pay the hefty Apple
                "tax" to use it because macOS behaves itself, but I am forced to
                use Windows 11 at work and I hate it for many of the reasons
                outlined in this article. Windows, like DOS before it decades
                ago, has become a boot-sector virus. Windows delenda est!

                    ...<br />"The DRD4/7R allele has been linked to greater food
                    and drug cravings, novelty-seeking, and ADHD symptoms,"
                    explained study leader Dan Eisenberg back in 2008. "It is
                    possible that in the nomadic setting, a boy with this allele
                    might be able to more effectively defend livestock against
                    raiders or locate food and water sources, but that the same
                    tendencies might not be as beneficial in settled pursuits
                    such as focusing in school, farming or selling goods."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So a fascinating hypothesis emerged. Could the genetic
                    traits of ADHD be somewhat beneficial to a tribe by pushing
                    some people to be 'explorers'? What manifests in modern
                    times as fidgety restlessness could actually have been
                    useful to tribes foraging the countryside for food.<br />...<br />Around
                    450 people participated in the experiment, and all were
                    simultaneously screened for ADHD symptoms. Unsurprisingly,
                    the researchers found those with higher ADHD scores moved on
                    to new bushes sooner than others but more importantly, those
                    with ADHD also tended to collect higher volumes of berries
                    overall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Writing in the newly published study, Barack and colleagues
                    noted that participants without ADHD characteristics tended
                    to over-harvest single patches. Looking at what would be an
                    optimal harvest strategy for the game it was discovered that
                    players with high ADHD scores were more successful overall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In addition, we discovered that participants that screened
                    positive for ADHD more readily abandoned patches and
                    achieved higher reward rates than did participants who
                    screened negative," the researchers concluded. "Given the
                    over-staying displayed by participants overall, those with
                    elevated ASRS scores made exploratory decisions that were
                    more closely aligned with the predictions of optimal
                    foraging theory, and, in this sense, behaved more
                    optimally."

                OS/2 was a joint operating system project by IBM and Microsoft,
                which was intended for IBM's own Personal System/2 (PS/2) PCs.
                (If you've ever seen the old circular ports used by keyboards
                and mice on old PCs, those are also called PS/2 ports— because
                they're inherited from this.)
              </p>
              <p>
                While OS/2 comes after the original IBM PC DOS and MS-DOS, we
                know today that the partnership between IBM and Microsoft would
                not last in that form. Microsoft eventually stopped working with
                IBM in 1992 when it dropped Windows 3.1, a direct competitor of
                the OS/2 software IBM paid it to make.
              </p>
              <p>
                OS/2 was intended as a protected-mode successor of PC DOS
                targeting the Intel 80286 processor. Notably, basic system calls
                were modeled after MS-DOS calls; their names even started with
                "Dos" and it was possible to create "Family Mode" applications –
                text mode applications that could work on both systems. Because
                of this heritage, OS/2 shares similarities with Unix, Xenix, and
                Windows NT.
              </p>
              <p>
                Up to $990 million per year was spent developing OS/2 and its
                replacement. OS/2 sales were largely concentrated in networked
                computing used by corporate professionals; however, by the early
                1990s, it was overtaken by Microsoft Windows NT. While OS/2 was
                arguably technically superior to Microsoft Windows 95, OS/2
                failed to develop much penetration in the mass market consumer
                and stand-alone desktop PC segments.
              </p>
              <p>
                IBM discontinued its support for OS/2 on December 31, 2006.
                Since then, OS/2 has been developed, supported and sold by two
                different third-party vendors under license from IBM – first by
                Serenity Systems as eComStation since 2001, and later by Arca
                Noae LLC as ArcaOS since 2017.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're reading this before April 15, 2024, and wish to dig
                into OS/2 computing history, you're also advised to check out
                the Hobbes OS/2 Archive while it still exists. The Hobbes OS/2
                Archive is the longest-lived host of OS/2 software, but the
                decades have finally caught up to it, and it's set to close in
                April.<br />

                Submitter remembers buying OS/2 Warp (
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2"

                ) (although, not really sure which version) : The box I bought
                (if memory serves... which it doesn't Batman...) came with a CD
                and like 10 diskettes. I didn't have a CD drive at the time, so
                had to install from the many diskettes, which didn't always
                install failure free. Finally got it installed and tried it out
                some, but, again if memory serves, had so little hard-drive
                space that i couldn't install much else to fool with to test
                compatibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then Windows Whatever came along (remember "Start me up" from
                the Rolling Stones?) and then finally found Linux and never
                looked back.

                    For the supermassive black hole's size, the researchers
                    propose two possible estimates: one at 17 billion solar
                    masses, and the other at 19 billion solar masses. That's not
                    the most massive one known, but there are only about a dozen
                    thought to be larger. (For comparison, the one at the center
                    of the Milky Way is "only" about 4 million solar masses.)
                    The data is best fit by a moderate spin, with us viewing it
                    from about 45 degrees off the pole of the black hole. The
                    accretion disk would be roughly seven light-years across.
                    Meaning, if the system were centered on our Sun, several
                    nearby stars would be within the disk.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The accretion rate needed to power the brightness is just
                    below the Eddington limit and works out to roughly 370 solar
                    masses of material per year. Or, about a Sun a day. At that
                    rate, it would take about 30 million years to double in

                    The system's extreme nature, then, may actually help us
                    figure out its details despite its immense distance.
                    Meanwhile, the researchers wonder whether other unusual
                    systems might remain undiscovered simply because we haven't
                    considered that an object might be a quasar instead of a
                    star.

                    Bianchini was a professor of mathematics and astronomy at
                    the University of Ferrara, but he also had a background in
                    what we'd now call finance – he was a merchant, and managed
                    assets and investments for a wealthy ruling family of the
                    time. That real-world experience seems to have influenced
                    his mathematical work, since Bianchini was known to have
                    created his own system of dividing measurement units like
                    feet into 10 equal parts to make them easier to work with.
                    As fundamental as it feels to modern sensibilities, it
                    didn't catch on with the 15th century crowd who were used to
                    a base-60 system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, Dr. Glen Van Brummelen, a professor at Trinity Western
                    University in Canada, has discovered that Bianchini
                    illustrated this system with a decimal point, the first
                    ever. Van Brummelen found that in a manuscript called
                    Tabulae primi mobilis B, Bianchini was using numbers with
                    dots in the middle – the first one being 10.4 – and showing
                    how to multiply them, something that was tricky in a base-60
                    system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I realized that he's using this just as we do, and he knows
                    how to do calculations with it," Van Brummelen told Nature.
                    "I remember running up and down the hallways of the dorm
                    with my computer trying to find anybody who was awake,
                    shouting 'look at this, this guy is doing decimal points in
                    the 1440s!'"

                    solely requires a reactive approach to security," Rogers
                    said. "Instead, in my experience, systems should be designed
                    and maintained with comprehensive security measures."

                    At $US15,000, BYD's new Qin EV is already being touted as a
                    "Corolla killer" as the world's second largest EV maker
                    continues to disrupt the global auto market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Launched earlier this week in China, the all-electric Qin
                    Plus has five models priced between 109,800 RMB to
                    ($A23,300) to 139,800 RMB ($A29,700).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Qin Plus comes with a 100 kW motor and the option of
                    either a 48 kWh battery providing 420 km CLTC range or a
                    57.6 kW hour battery with 510 km range.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Indeed, most legacy car makers, at least those that
                    are bothering to make EVs at scale at all, are still focused
                    on the top end of the market, selling premium and heavy and
                    high cost EVs, largely to protect their ICE business. In the
                    US, the major car makers are retreating rapidly on their EV
                    plans.

                    BYD, which is challenging Tesla as the biggest EV maker in
                    the world, says it's "officially opening a new era where
                    electricity is lower than oil."

                    avoid being liable for infringement by its users is to
                    terminate a household or business's account after a small
                    number of accusations—perhaps only two. The court also
                    allowed a damages formula that can lead to nearly unlimited
                    damages, with no relationship to any actual harm suffered.
                    If not overturned, this decision will lead to an untold
                    number of people losing vital Internet access as ISPs start

                    In today's 4th Circuit ruling, appeals court judges wrote
                    that "Sony failed, as a matter of law, to prove that Cox
                    profits directly from its subscribers' copyright

                    A defendant may be vicariously liable for a third party's
                    copyright infringement if it profits directly from it and is
                    in a position to supervise the infringer, the ruling said.
                    Cox argued that it doesn't profit directly from infringement
                    because it receives the same monthly fee from subscribers
                    whether they illegally download copyrighted files or not,
                    the ruling noted.

                    Cycles of a diet that mimics fasting can reduce signs of
                    immune system aging, as well as insulin resistance and liver
                    fat in humans, resulting in a lower biological age,
                    according to a new USC Leonard Davis School of
                    Gerontology-led study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study, published in Nature Communications on Feb. 20,
                    adds to the body of evidence supporting the beneficial
                    effects of the fasting-mimicking diet (FMD).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The FMD is a five-day diet high in unsaturated fats and low
                    in overall calories, protein, and carbohydrates and is
                    designed to mimic the effects of a water-only fast while
                    still providing necessary nutrients and making it much
                    easier for people to complete the fast. The diet was
                    developed by the laboratory of USC Leonard Davis School
                    Professor Valter Longo, the senior author of the new study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is the first study to show that a food-based
                    intervention that does not require chronic dietary or other
                    lifestyle changes can make people biologically younger,
                    based on both changes in risk factors for aging and disease
                    and on a validated method developed by the Levine group to
                    assess biological age," Longo said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Previous research led by Longo has indicated that brief,
                    periodic FMD cycles are associated with a range of
                    beneficial effects. They can:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p>Promote stem cell regeneration</p></li>
                    <li>Lessen chemotherapy side effects</li>
                    <li>Reduce the signs of dementia in mice</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    In addition, the FMD cycles can lower the risk factors for
                    cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other age-related
                    diseases in humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Longo lab also had previously shown that one or two
                    cycles of the FMD for five days a month increased the
                    healthspan and lifespan of mice on either a normal or
                    Western diet, but the effects of the FMD on aging and
                    biological age, liver fat, and immune system aging in humans
                    were unknown until now.

                    reported that Reddit has signed a contract allowing an
                    unnamed AI company to train its models on the site's
                    content, according to people familiar with the matter. The
                    move comes as the social media platform nears the
                    introduction of its initial public offering (IPO), which
                    could happen as soon as next month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Reddit initially revealed the deal, which is reported to be
                    worth $60 million a year, earlier in 2024 to potential
                    investors of an anticipated IPO, Bloomberg said. The
                    Bloomberg source speculates that the contract could serve as
                    a model for future agreements with other AI companies.

                    expressly seeking any rightsholder permission, some tech
                    firms have more recently begun entering deals where some
                    content used for training AI models similar to GPT-4 (which
                    runs the paid version of ChatGPT) comes under license. In

                    with German publisher Axel Springer (publisher of Politico
                    and Business Insider) for access to its articles.
                    Previously, OpenAI has struck deals with other
                    organizations, including

                    If the reported $60 million/year deal goes through, it's
                    quite possible that if you've ever posted on Reddit, some of
                    that material may be used to train the next generation of AI
                    models that create text, still pictures, and video. Even

                    The Herculaneum library contains mostly works of Epicurean
                    philosophy. This is a strand of philosophy founded around
                    307BC, based on the teachings of Epicurus—an ancient Greek
                    philosopher who believed that a correct understanding of
                    physics, backed up by rigorous argument, was necessary to
                    achieve happiness, because it removed human fears about the
                    gods (they don't care about us), natural phenomena (not
                    signs of divine anger), and post-mortem punishment (our
                    souls do not survive our deaths).

                    is the most common author in the library. One copy of his
                    History of Plato's Academy was probably his own draft, so we
                    can be confident the library is made up in part from his
                    books. This is also why we think the owner of the villa was
                    Julius Caesar's father-in-law, L. Calpurnius Piso
                    Caesoninus: we know Philodemus was his personal philosopher,
                    and only the highest Roman elite could afford a house that
                    big.

                  <p>
                    Epicurus makes up a substantial proportion of the library

                        On February 20, 2024, an optimization to the user
                        experience introduced a bug with how the model processes
                        language. LLMs generate responses by randomly sampling
                        words based in part on probabilities. Their "language"
                        consists of numbers that map to tokens. In this case,
                        the bug was in the step where the model chooses these
                        numbers. Akin to being lost in translation, the model
                        chose slightly wrong numbers, which produced word
                        sequences that made no sense. More technically,
                        inference kernels produced incorrect results when used
                        in certain GPU configurations. Upon identifying the
                        cause of this incident, we rolled out a fix and
                        confirmed that the incident was resolved.

                    The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has
                    <a
                      href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng/#%7Bitemid:[001-230854]%7D"

                    that weakening end-to-end encryption disproportionately
                    risks undermining human rights. The international court's
                    decision could potentially disrupt the European Commission's
                    proposed plans to require email and messaging service
                    providers to create backdoors that would allow law
                    enforcement to easily decrypt users' messages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This ruling came after Russia's intelligence agency, the
                    Federal Security Service (FSS), began requiring Telegram to
                    share users' encrypted messages to deter "terrorism-related
                    activities" in 2017, ECHR's ruling said. A Russian Telegram
                    user alleged that FSS's requirement violated his rights to a
                    private life and private communications, as well as all
                    Telegram users' rights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Telegram user was apparently disturbed, moving to block
                    required disclosures after Telegram refused to comply with
                    an FSS order to decrypt messages on six users suspected of
                    terrorism. According to Telegram, "it was technically
                    impossible to provide the authorities with encryption keys
                    associated with specific users," and therefore, "any
                    disclosure of encryption keys" would affect the "privacy of
                    the correspondence of all Telegram users," the ECHR's ruling
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For refusing to comply, Telegram was fined, and one court
                    even ordered the app to be blocked in Russia, while dozens
                    of Telegram users rallied to continue challenging the order
                    to maintain Telegram services in Russia. Ultimately, users'
                    multiple court challenges failed, sending the case before
                    the ECHR while Telegram services seemingly tenuously
                    remained available in Russia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Seemingly most critically, the government told the
                    ECHR that any intrusion on private lives resulting from
                    decrypting messages was "necessary" to combat terrorism in a
                    democratic society. To back up this claim, the government
                    pointed to a 2017 terrorist attack that was "coordinated
                    from abroad through secret chats via Telegram." The
                    government claimed that a second terrorist attack that year
                    was prevented after the government discovered it was being
                    coordinated through Telegram chats.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the end, the ECHR concluded that the Telegram
                    user's rights had been violated, partly due to privacy
                    advocates and international reports that corroborated
                    Telegram's position that complying with the FSB's disclosure
                    order would force changes impacting all its users.

              <p><b>Statistics</b></p>
              <p>
                Community members sometimes ask for details of our community
                size and the level of activity that they create. I have
                collected some statistics which might be of interest. It is
                important to note that these are a very small snapshot of our
                overall activity but they are typical of the last few weeks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each week there are around 250-300 unique UIDs logging on to the
                site with occasional peaks just above 300. These are people who
                actually log in using their username and so represent only a
                portion of those who read the stories that we produce.
                Interestingly perhaps, they use around 7500 different IP
                addresses indicating perhaps that VPN use is increasing from
                what it was a few years ago and, equally likely, that they are
                logging in using different devices and perhaps from different
                locations (work, home, laptop, smartphone etc). But this is only
                those logging in by name. Others prefer to use our RSS feeds and
                dedicated software so that they can see the output of several
                different sites in a single display. Finally, there is the group
                who never log in but who read our front page content without
                making comments or joining in by moderating. Nothing can be done
                to identify their numbers. Elsewhere on the site there are an
                unknown number of Anonymous Cowards who participate in the
                discussions in journals. The current statistics do not include
                journal discussions as far as I can tell.

                The daily figures indicate that we receive somewhere between 60
                and 180 comments per day. This varies considerably from day to
                day. Some only log in at weekends, others only log in during the
                working week, and of course it also depends on the actual
                stories themselves. Some stories can attract over 50 comments or
                more alone whereas others, which are there to inform but not
                necessarily require a response from anyone, might only gather a
                few comments. But a better picture can be gathered by looking at
                the page hits. The average number of article hits per day is
                over 2500. Each week we serve almost 250,000 pages but because
                we use a simple text format with virtually no graphics, adverts
                or anything else distracting it appears to only amount to single
                digit GBs. Again there is a significant daily variation. There
                is also a variation of course during the 24 hour period with the
                site receiving between 2 and 5 hits per second. This is not as
                clear to see as you might think it would be and it seems to
                suggest that either people keep very unusual hours or that our
                readership is spread far more evenly around the world.

                As an aside, it was possible to see the breaks during the
                SuperBowl transmission as, on that particular day, the activity
                levels peaked significantly at those times.
              </p>
              <p><b>We Are Not a Linux Only Site</b></p>
              <p>
                Some comments have been critical that we are including stories
                about Microsoft Windows. Why shouldn't we? We always have done
                so. We are not limited to a single OS. We can discuss any OS, or
                indeed any software whatsoever. Some of our community have
                chosen Windows because it is what they like, others use it
                because it is necessary to have it to control a specific item of
                equipment or produce a specific data format, and for others it
                is forced upon them by work or contractual obligations. I
                realise that we have far more Linux users than any other OS but
                that is because our community includes many who have the
                technical ability to manage it and an interest in open source
                software. Like it or not, Windows is included in STEM. Just
                because we don't all choose to use it doesn't mean it no longer
                exists.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember, it is YOU who provide the submissions. The editors'
                job is to prepare them for publication while maintaining as much
                variety as possible in discussions. So let us hear your praise
                or gripes about BSD variants, Linux variants (e.g. including
                TAILS, recovery thumb-drives etc) or any other OS that you use
                today or have used in the past. If you are using it today then
                tell us why you chose that particular OS.

              <p><b>Spamming</b></p>
              <p>
                We have had a couple of dormant accounts suddenly spring into
                life and start spamming. They had been created weeks or months
                ago but had been inactive since being created. If you see any
                similar activity please let the staff know - there could be many
                more. It is easy to stop it but with over 30,000 fake accounts
                it is a monumental task to watch them all. The standard Spammers
                ban (for 10+ years) was applied to both accounts. As it was,
                they were spamming where they were unlikely to be seen by many
                people
              </p>
              <p>
                Spamming continues to be a problem but it is being managed and
                that tends to keep it away from the main pages. We have our own
                local spammers of course. At the time of writing, one of them
                has posted the same message (beginning with "We don't hate you,
                my dear soft and fluffy khallow") a total of 97 times since 05
                February. It had already been posted many times before that but
                now we have new software that makes spamming easier to identify
                and a method to remove it from view. However, there is a copy of
                every comment that is 'removed'. The same person has posted 258
                spam comments in total in the same time period including a
                doxxing attempt. The site Policy document details the action
                that we can take against spammers. It refers to a graduated
                system. We have tried polite requests, (from 2021 onwards),
                followed by firmer requests, marking as Spam and recently we
                have increased that to the next level. The comments are removed
                from view. This is an exceptional measure and not one that is
                taken lightly. I do not expect that this will change anything
                but it does clean up a lot of the discussions in the poll and
                the journals and does take away the spammers 'voice'
                significantly. He is, of course, already permanently banned.
                That he is complaining many times a day makes me suspect it is
                also working as well as we could have expected.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is another local spammer who seems to be confused as to
                the method to be employed when making complaints but I am hoping
                that we can remedy this. Which brings me on to the next topic...
              </p>
              <p><b>Complaints About Staff or Policy</b></p>
              <p>
                It is no good complaining about how staff are managing the site
                or your own particular views of any individual staff member by
                making comments in a journal as an Anonymous Coward. Firstly, we
                are not responsible for the contents of journals so there is no
                guarantee that we will actually look at them (but we are
                responsible to our community for ensuring that the site is not
                abused, and that individuals are not harassed in attempts to try
                to silence them).
              </p>
              <p>
                Secondly, as an Anonymous Coward, you are welcome to participate
                on this site but you do not have much say in how it is run or
                managed. That privilege comes only with an account.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you wish to complain about a member of staff there are
                several actions that you can take. Send an email to our usual
                Admin email address (with an email address life expectancy of
                more than a few minutes, but we will accept emails from secure
                email sites such as Proton or Tuta Mail) to our usual Admin
                address. It does not only go to a single admin but goes to
                <b>every</b> admin. It will get read and, if the complaint
                requires it, it will be investigated and the appropriate action
                taken. If we cannot contact you then your complaint may be
                ignored. More serious complaints can be sent by mail to the
                site's formal address which you can find by looking at the
                business records of the site. That will go directly to the Board
                which, as you know, has the ultimate power on this site.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you wish to complain about the site's policy then the first
                action should again be to send an email (with an address life
                expectancy of more than a few minutes) to our usual Admin
                address with your reason for wanting a policy change and also
                submit a draft of what you would like the actual policy to be.
                It can then be presented to the community for further discussion
                and a vote. If we cannot contact you then it is unlikely that
                any action will be taken. If you do not provide at least a
                suggested solution then you cannot reasonably expect anyone to
                action your anonymous request.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a couple of community members who have been looking at
                policy issues for several years now. I think they will agree
                that we always give what they say serious consideration and
                implement what they suggest if it is possible. We learn a lot
                from each other. When the new site has been created then you
                will all be invited to make your suggestions as to future
                policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, complaints like "I don't like what you are doing -
                close the site down now!" will be carefully studied before we
                all roll around laughing and throw it in the trash can. If you
                do not like this site then you are free to go elsewhere. We do
                not have to close the site down simply because you are unhappy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nobody on the staff has a problem with receiving a genuine
                complaint if it is intended to improve the site or the
                community's enjoyment of it. But that enjoyment has to be
                applicable to the majority of the site, not simply to one or two
                individuals or even a significant minority.

                    Strong high-altitude winds over the Mid-Atlantic sped up sky

                    greater than the speed of sound, it was still moving through

                    America has returned to the moon after a 52-year absence.
                    The unmanned Odysseus spacecraft touched down on the lunar

                The general tone of this story here and elsewhere seems to be
                that this heralds a new era of a commercial space industry, but
                until one can show that there is any commercial value to being
                on the Moon besides directly supporting NASA/ESA/etc., is this a
                watershed moment, or is this just slightly expanding the
                potential NASA/ESA/etc. contractor pool? --hubie

                    [...] The OpenAI team plans to draw on the safety testing it
                    did last year for DALL-E 3. Sora already includes a filter
                    that runs on all prompts sent to the model that will block
                    requests for violent, sexual, or hateful images, as well as
                    images of known people. Another filter will look at frames
                    of generated videos and block material that violates
                    OpenAI's safety policies.

                  <p>
                    OpenAI says it is also adapting a fake-image detector
                    developed for DALL-E 3 to use with Sora. And the company
                    will embed industry-standard C2PA tags, metadata that states
                    how an image was generated, into all of Sora's output. But
                    these steps are far from foolproof. Fake-image detectors are
                    hit-or-miss. Metadata is easy to remove, and most social
                    media sites strip it from uploaded images by default.

                    In April, a New York start-up called Runway AI unveiled
                    technology that let people generate videos, like a cow at a
                    birthday party or a dog chatting on a smartphone, simply by

                    The four-second videos were blurry, choppy, distorted and
                    disturbing. But they were a clear sign that artificial
                    intelligence technologies would generate increasingly
                    convincing videos in the months and years to come.

                    Just 10 months later, the San Francisco start-up OpenAI has
                    unveiled a similar system that creates videos that look as
                    if they were lifted from a Hollywood movie. A demonstration
                    included short videos — created in minutes — of woolly
                    mammoths trotting through a snowy meadow, a monster gazing
                    at a melting candle and a Tokyo street scene seemingly shot
                    by a camera swooping across the city.

                  <p>
                    OpenAI is launching a new video-generation model, and it's
                    called Sora. The
                    <a href="https://openai.com/sora">AI company says Sora</a>
                    "can create realistic and imaginative scenes from text
                    instructions." The text-to-video model allows users to
                    create photorealistic videos up to a minute long — all based
                    on prompts they've written.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sora is capable of creating "complex scenes with multiple
                    characters, specific types of motion, and accurate details
                    of the subject and background," according to OpenAI's
                    introductory blog post. The company also notes that the
                    model can understand how objects "exist in the physical
                    world," as well as "accurately interpret props and generate
                    compelling characters that express vibrant emotions."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The model can also generate a video based on a still image,
                    as well as fill in missing frames on an existing video or
                    extend it. The Sora-generated demos included in OpenAI's
                    blog post include an aerial scene of California during the
                    gold rush, a video that looks as if it were shot from the
                    inside of a Tokyo train, and others. Many have some telltale
                    signs of AI — like a suspiciously moving floor in a video of
                    a museum — and OpenAI says the model "may struggle with
                    accurately simulating the physics of a complex scene," but
                    the results are overall pretty impressive.

                    doctors say it only takes a few holdouts to fuel an
                    outbreak. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and

                    using a religious exemption to opt their children out of
                    traditional childhood vaccinations is trending upward.

                    time they enter kindergarten because parents are scared,
                    they're kind of feeding into this misinformation," said Dr.
                    Lisa Gwynn, a pediatrician who teaches pediatrics at the
                    University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. "It is
                    extremely unfortunate because it's all preventable, and the
                    measles vaccine has been around a long time and it's safe
                    and effective, so the fact that we are still seeing this in
                    modern times is really unfortunate, it's also dangerous for

                    The only way Microsoft or OpenAI would know this would be to
                    spy on chatbot sessions. I'm sure the terms of service—if I

                    course it's no surprise that Microsoft and OpenAI (and,
                    presumably, everyone else) are spying on our usage of AI,
                    but this confirms it.

                MIT engineers developed a tag that can reveal with near-perfect

                    A few years ago, MIT researchers invented a
                    <a
                      href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/cryptographic-tag-supply-chain-0220"

                    that is several times smaller and significantly cheaper than
                    the traditional radio frequency tags (RFIDs) that are often
                    affixed to products to verify their authenticity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This tiny tag, which offers improved security over RFIDs,
                    utilizes terahertz waves, which are smaller and travel much
                    faster than radio waves [SIC - er, no] . But this terahertz
                    tag shared a major security vulnerability with traditional
                    RFIDs: A counterfeiter could peel the tag off a genuine item
                    and reattach it to a fake, and the authentication system
                    would be none the wiser.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers have now surmounted this security
                    vulnerability by leveraging terahertz waves to develop an
                    antitampering ID tag that still offers the benefits of being
                    tiny, cheap, and secure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They mix microscopic metal particles into the glue that
                    sticks the tag to an object, and then use terahertz waves to
                    detect the unique pattern those particles form on the item's
                    surface. Akin to a fingerprint, this random glue pattern is
                    used to authenticate the item, explains Eunseok Lee, an
                    electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) graduate
                    student and lead author of a paper on the antitampering tag.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These metal particles are essentially like mirrors for
                    terahertz waves. If I spread a bunch of mirror pieces onto a
                    surface and then shine light on that, depending on the
                    orientation, size, and location of those mirrors, I would
                    get a different reflected pattern. But if you peel the chip
                    off and reattach it, you destroy that pattern," adds Ruonan
                    Han, an associate professor in EECS, who leads the Terahertz
                    Integrated Electronics Group in the Research Laboratory of
                    Electronics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This research project was partly inspired by Han's
                    favorite car wash. The business stuck an RFID tag onto his
                    windshield to authenticate his car wash membership. For
                    added security, the tag was made from fragile paper so it
                    would be destroyed if a less-than-honest customer tried to
                    peel it off and stick it on a different windshield.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But that is not a terribly reliable way to prevent
                    tampering. For instance, someone could use a solution to
                    dissolve the glue and safely remove the fragile tag.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rather than authenticating the tag, a better security
                    solution is to authenticate the item itself, Han says. To
                    achieve this, the researchers targeted the glue at the
                    interface between the tag and the item's surface.

                    Solar cell efficiency may get a bump from bumps. New
                    research suggests that building tiny domes into the surface
                    of organic solar cells could boost their efficiency by up to
                    two-thirds, while capturing light from a wider angle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Solar cells are usually flat, which maximizes how much of
                    the surface is exposed to sunlight at any given time. This
                    design works best when the Sun is within a certain angle, so
                    the panels are usually tilted between 15 and 40 degrees to
                    get the most out of the day.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists have toyed with other shapes for the surface,
                    including embedding
                    <a

                    which trap and circulate sunlight to allow the device to
                    capture more energy from it. For the new study, scientists
                    at Abdullah Gül University in Türkiye ran complex
                    simulations of how dome-shaped bumps might boost organic
                    solar surfaces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team studied photovoltaic cells made with an organic
                    polymer called P3HT:ICBA as the active layer, above a layer
                    of aluminum and a substrate of PMMA, capped off with a
                    transparent protective layer of indium tin oxide (ITO). This
                    sandwich structure was kept through the whole dome, or
                    "hemispherical shell" as the team calls it.<br />...<br />Compared
                    to flat surfaces, solar cells dotted with bumps showed 36%
                    and 66% improvements in light absorption, depending on the
                    polarization of the light. Those bumps also allowed light to
                    enter from a wider range of directions than a flat surface,
                    providing an angular coverage of up to 82 degrees.

                First seen in a Buffalo News story (paywalled?) which ends with
                this:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Khavis said even in areas where newspapers didn't completely
                    close, but downsized or merged to the point where "they were
                    open in name only," they saw the same effect on nonprofit
                    executive pay.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The number of papers closing does not bode well for
                    "misbehavior" by institutions, Khavis said. Between 2004 and
                    2015, the U.S. newspaper industry lost more than 1,800 print
                    outlets to closures and mergers. A study by Northwestern
                    University's Medill School of Journalism found that the rate
                    of local newspaper closings accelerated to 2.5 per week in
                    2023.
