                    Since introducing the App Store in 2008, Apple has run it
                    largely the same way across 175 countries, right down to the

                    more than seven million jobs and delivered Apple billions of

                    Apple – which said it contests the decision – behaved this

                    Apple's anti-steering rules have prevented developers from
                    directing users outside the App Store – thereby
                    circumventing Apple's 30 percent commission – for in-app
                    purchases and subscriptions. As part of the EC decision,
                    Apple is being forced to end the use of anti-steering
                    provisions in the bloc, but this restriction applies only to
                    music streaming apps, an EC spokesperson told The Register.

                    Vestager described Apple's anti-competitive conduct as
                    having gone on for nearly a decade, resulting in iOS users
                    paying "significantly higher prices for music streaming
                    subscriptions." The anti-steering provisions also led to a
                    "degraded user experience," Vestager said, as users were
                    forced to "engage in a cumbersome search" to find cheaper
                    prices outside the App Store because the anti-steering rule
                    also prevented developers from telling users about cheaper
                    prices available elsewhere.

                    Apple on Monday was fined 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion)
                    by European Union regulators for thwarting competition among
                    music streaming rivals, a severe punishment levied against
                    the tech giant in a long-simmering battle over the powerful
                    role it plays as gatekeeper of the App Store.

                  <p>
                    The penalty, announced by the E.U. antitrust regulator, is
                    the culmination of a five-year investigation set in motion
                    by one of its biggest rivals, Spotify. Regulators said Apple
                    illegally used its App Store dominance to box out rivals.

                    The European Commission decided to fine the company after
                    finding that its anti-steering rules may have led iOS users
                    to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming
                    subscriptions. Additionally, officials determined the
                    provisions caused "non-monetary harm in the form of a
                    degraded user experience." Because developers can't include
                    a link to external purchase options in their apps, users
                    have to search manually for those purchase options.

                So, in the background, the owners of the PBC have been working
                with staff to get the site moved over to a new legal entity and
                continue operations. This process is moving slowly, but it is
                moving, with the expectation that we should be able to fully
                hand off SN in the next month or so. However, the PBC has burned
                through its cash reserves, and we have an overdue Linode bill as
                is for $268 USD. I could write more, but the tl;dr, without
                money, SN will disappear off the Internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the subscriptions understandably stopped due to the
                uncertainty with site ownership and management. However, we're
                not able to pay the bills with the trickle coming in. At this
                point, everyone involved has agreed with and are working towards
                a solution to move SN to a not-for-profit and 501(c)3, but we do
                need the communities financial support to get there. If we can
                raise $500 USD via subscriptions, direct donations, or other
                means, that would keep the site up past May. As such, if you
                have let your subscription lapse, or otherwise are able to
                support SN, please do so now.

                    A daily fiber supplement improved brain function in people
                    over 60 in just 12 weeks. The study, published recently in
                    Nature Communications by researchers from the School of Life
                    Course &amp; Population Sciences showed that this simple and
                    cheap addition to diet can improve performance in memory
                    tests associated with early signs of Alzheimer's disease.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the prebiotic supplements inulin and FOS were found
                    to have no effect on muscle strength over this period.

                    "We are excited to see these changes in just 12 weeks. This
                    holds huge promise for enhancing brain health and memory in
                    our aging population. Unlocking the secrets of the gut-brain
                    axis could offer new approaches for living more healthily
                    for longer," says first author Dr. Mary Ni Lochlainn from
                    the Department of Twin Research.

                    As populations age globally, the prevalence of age-related
                    conditions such as cognitive decline and muscle loss is on
                    the rise. Researchers at TwinsUK, the U.K.'s largest adult
                    twin registry based at King's College London, sought to
                    understand how targeting the microbiota, the diverse
                    community of microorganisms residing in our intestines,
                    using two cheap, commercially available plant fiber
                    supplements inulin and FOS, could impact both muscle health
                    and brain function.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers assigned 36 twin pairs—72 individuals—over 60
                    years old to receive either a placebo or the supplement
                    every day for 12 weeks. Neither the analysis team, nor the
                    participants knew which they received until the analysis was
                    complete (double-blind). Alongside this, all study
                    participants did resistance exercises and ate a protein
                    supplement which was aimed at improving muscle function.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers monitored participants remotely via video,
                    online questionnaires and cognitive tests. They found the
                    fiber supplement led to significant changes in the
                    participants' gut microbiome composition, particularly an
                    increase in the numbers of beneficial bacteria such as
                    Bifidobacterium.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While there was no significant difference in muscle strength
                    between the groups, the group receiving the fiber supplement
                    performed better in tests assessing brain function,
                    including the Paired Associates Learning test which is an

                    Humpback whales have been observed having sex for the first
                    time, with this landmark moment having an interesting twist
                    – the two whales were male.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite decades of research on humpback whales, sightings of
                    the male's penis have been rare. Copulation by the species
                    had not been documented by people – until now, when two
                    photographers captured images of a sexual encounter between
                    two whales off the coast of Hawaii.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The sighting, confirmed by scientists in a newly published
                    study, occurred in January 2022 in waters west of the island
                    of Maui, where two whales approached and circled a boat
                    before engaging in sexual activity about three to five
                    meters below the vessel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Both of the whales were male, which makes the photos, taken
                    by Lyle Krannichfeld and Brandi Romano, the first evidence
                    of homosexual behavior in humpback whales as well as the
                    first sighting of sex in the species. Homosexual behavior is
                    common in the animal kingdom and has been spotted among
                    dolphins and orca whales, but never previously between
                    humpback whales.

                    The researchers showed that mechanical stresses induced on a
                    water strider's body were well below safe limits for a
                    strider, as determined by separate experiments in which they
                    compressed a strider's exoskeleton to the point of rupture.
                    These stresses come both from compression forces from the
                    falling drops and from inertial forces induced by
                    acceleration of the water around the point of impact. After
                    submersion, a strider quickly reemerges by using "power
                    strokes" to reach the surface and by grabbing onto floating
                    particles. While submerged, the strider can exploit its
                    plastron—a bubble the insect carries around its hydrophobic
                    body—as a temporary source of air. Thanks to the plastron,
                    striders can survive several minutes of submersion, says
                    Dickerson.

                    >, you're used to using Apple's iMessage, which is similar
                    to RCS in that it offers many features that traditional text
                    doesn't. However, Android users are probably familiar with
                    RCS chat through third-party messaging apps.

                    Understanding RCS messaging isn't difficult when you realize
                    what it includes. Since it's generally the more dynamic and
                    secure way to communicate via text compared to SMS and
                    multimedia messaging service (MMS), you'll want to know how
                    to take advantage of it going forward.

                    according to Abraham-James, will now be installed over the
                    hole to allow for additional sampling and testing. A crew
                    from Duluth Metals in 2011 first discovered helium in the
                    area when searching for platinum-palladium metals, the News

                    Visa – one of the world's two biggest payments processors –
                    appears to be moving into biometric data-based
                    authentication, at least according to a patent it has
                    applied for. And Visa claims that this would be fully
                    privacy-friendly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If Visa's patent – designed, according to the giant's
                    filing, to provide "biometric templates for privacy
                    preserving authentication" – is approved and implemented,
                    the end result would be replacement of PINs with biometric
                    identification.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The method would be used at ATMs, payment checkouts, and
                    Visa made sure to note that the technology's use can be
                    extended to unlocking apartments or letting people into
                    venues like theaters, amusement parks, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These latter, non-payment scenarios would allow Visa to
                    monetize the patent via licensing to other companies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rationale for using such a system is said to be to
                    improve security of user information in physical spaces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The patent states that the system would work by customers
                    enrolling into the program which means creating "a biometric
                    template" on their device.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This data is encrypted and signed, and that signature,
                    rather than the biometric information, is used by "access
                    device" to verify the signature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This, Visa said in the filing, is what preserves privacy,
                    since the templates are stored on the user device rather
                    than "in some giant database."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This appears to be the key point the company is trying to
                    make with the proposed patent, and was careful to stress
                    that security breaching of such databases results in
                    "disastrous" consequences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's because the use of biometrics is at once safer than
                    that of PINs and passwords, but also much riskier, given
                    that unauthorized access provides those behind a hack to a
                    large amount of personal information.

                    Studies at MIT and elsewhere are producing mounting evidence
                    that light flickering and sound clicking at the gamma brain
                    rhythm frequency of 40 Hz can reduce Alzheimer's disease
                    (AD) progression and treat symptoms in human volunteers as
                    well as lab mice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new study in Nature using a mouse model of the disease,
                    researchers at The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory
                    of MIT reveal a key mechanism that may contribute to these
                    beneficial effects: clearance of amyloid proteins, a
                    hallmark of AD pathology, via the brain's glymphatic system,
                    a recently discovered "plumbing" network parallel to the
                    brain's blood vessels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Ever since we published our first results in 2016, people
                    have asked me how does it work? Why 40 Hz? Why not some
                    other frequency?" said study senior author Li-Huei Tsai,
                    Picower Professor of Neuroscience and director of The
                    Picower Institute and MIT's Aging Brain Initiative.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These are indeed very important questions we have worked
                    very hard in the lab to address."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new paper describes a series of experiments, led by
                    Mitch Murdock when he was a Brain and Cognitive Sciences
                    doctoral student at MIT, showing that when sensory gamma
                    stimulation increases 40 Hz power and synchrony in the
                    brains of mice, that prompts a particular type of neuron to
                    release peptides.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study results further suggest that those short protein
                    signals then drive specific processes that promote increased
                    amyloid clearance via the glymphatic system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We do not yet have a linear map of the exact sequence of
                    events that occurs," said Murdock, who was jointly
                    supervised by Tsai and co-author and collaborator Ed Boyden,
                    Y. Eva Tan Professor of Neurotechnology at MIT, a member of
                    the McGovern Institute for Brain Research and an affiliate
                    member of The Picower Institute. "But the findings in our
                    experiments support this clearance pathway through the major
                    glymphatic routes."

                    >, as a slog. Running a demo of the 1995 game on a Gateway
                    system with an Intel 486DX at 33 MHz, I trudged through
                    seemingly endless gray hallways. I shot at a steady trickle
                    of Stormtroopers with one of their own (intentionally)
                    semi-accurate blaster rifles. After a while, I would ask
                    myself a pertinent, era-specific question: Why was I playing
                    this low-energy nostalgia trip instead of actual Doom?<br />[...]<br />Nightdive
                    Studios continues its streak of providing spiffed-up but
                    eminently faithful remasters of classic titles with Dark
                    Forces Remastered. The studio's leaders
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/interview-how-system-shock-balanced-faithful-recreation-and-modern-design/"
                      >told Ars last year</a
                    >
                    that their goal was games that "play the way you remember
                    them playing. Not the way they actually did on your 486
                    [computer], but in an evocative manner." For me, Dark Forces
                    Remastered feels far, far better than I remember, and so
                    I've gotten a chance to absorb a lot more of the world it's
                    trying to evoke.<br />[...]<br />The little voice
                    stings—"Stop!" "You're not authorized!"—were a delight, if
                    often cut short by the quick dispatching of their speaker.
                    For the first few levels, I felt like the Rebellion could
                    have destroyed five Death Stars in just two movies if they
                    had a few more Kyles like me. But Dark Forces does ramp up
                    as you go on.

                  <p>
                    All the same cheat codes from the original game
                    work—Nightdive even gives you places to type them in and
                    then activate them in menus—and I had to lean on a couple
                    level skips and resupplies to get through the first seven
                    levels.<br />[...]<br />There are new lighting effects, much
                    nicer menus and options, gamepad support (including rumble),
                    and polished cutscenes, in addition to the gameplay that now
                    tilts a bit more toward Motörhead than Rush in speed and
                    feel. But, really, what sells Dark Forces Remastered is the
                    game beneath the upgrades. If you have any interest in
                    hopping on Jabba the Hutt's barge again, this is the way to
                    do it.

                Nostalgia, guaranteed to cause "irregular heartbeat, fever, and
                [...] death". Okay, this isn't the 17th century, so none of
                those apply.<br /><a

                I've tried to replay Dark Forces II (the sequel to the game
                mentioned in the article) and the experience was pretty
                terrible. Game design has really advanced since those dark ages
                and you really feel it on most older titles. For another
                example, the nostalgia of Wing Commander is real. However, the
                interface is beyond atrocious.

                it that you can't compete with nostalgia and the past is best
                left in the past? --hubie]

                    subscription before its end date up to $270 plus taxes (the
                    amount decreases to as little as $60, depending on the
                    printer rented and the length of the subscription). After
                    two years, users won't see a cancellation fee if they return
                    the rental printer and ink cartridges within 10 days after
                    canceling their subscription. With these tactics, HP is
                    creating the same type of subscription reliance that has

                    "never own a printer again," "say goodbye to your tech
                    troubles," and enjoy "hassle-free printing." The problem is
                    that tech troubles and hassle-filled printing aren't the
                    products of merely owning a printer; they're connected to

                    Using a combination of high-speed video, micro-computed
                    tomography, gene expression analysis, and finite difference
                    methods, the researchers show that the males of the
                    Danionella species possess a unique sound-generating
                    apparatus that includes drumming cartilage, a specialized
                    rib, and a fatigue-resistant muscle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This apparatus accelerates the drumming cartilage with a
                    force of over 2,000 g and shoots it against the swim bladder
                    to produce a rapid, loud pulse. These pulses are strung

                    The permanently transparent fish, which serve as a model
                    organism for biomedical research, are native to shallow and
                    turbid waters in Myanmar. "We assume that the competition
                    between the males in this visually restrictive environment
                    contributed to the development of the special mechanism for

                    "There is a difference between emulating a 30-year-old
                    system vs. a current one that's actively making money,"
                    Parsifal said.<br />[...]<br />Many emulator makers also
                    largely agreed with Nintendo's arguments that Yuzu
                    developers were too explicit about guiding users on how to
                    play copyrighted games through channels like their Quick
                    Start Guide and Discord channel. "I think Yuzu definitely
                    crossed some line when they started explaining how to
                    actually pirate games," one anonymous emulator developer
                    told Ars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I've personally experienced how strict most emulator
                    communities/discord servers/forums are regarding copyright
                    and piracy, so it's really weird to me that Yuzu devs
                    wouldn't be like that," Lycoder added.<br />[...]<br />Emulator
                    developers I talked to also pointed out the fact that the
                    Yuzu development team
                    <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yuzuteam"

                    >
                    through a Patreon campaign. That could imply "that their
                    goal is profit-making and not educational," ZJoyKiller said,
                    which is at the very least a suspect look in parts of the
                    community.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The fact that they are making money is a big no-no,
                    definitely how you can get on the [legal] radar," Parsifal
                    said.<br />[...]<br />Among the developers I talked to, it
                    doesn't seem like Nintendo's new lawsuit has had much of a
                    chilling effect on the work they're continuing to do on a
                    wide array of emulation projects. "It's more of a reminder
                    to keep up best practices that I already try to follow," one
                    anonymous developer told me. "It's not going to stop me from
                    making emulators," StrikerX3 added.<br />[...]<br />For the
                    most part, though, a healthy fear of
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/the-solid-legal-theory-behind-nintendos-new-emulator-takedown-effort/"
                      >Nintendo's litigiousness</a
                    >
                    seems to have been baked in well before this week's legal
                    developments. "From a personal standpoint, it just
                    reinforces that if I were to write a Nintendo emulator, even
                    of an old system, I'd probably keep my repo completely
                    private," ZJoyKiller said. "Or if public, I'd do so under a
                    different account. But I've always thought this anyway.
                    So... no, this ruling doesn't change much on how I see
                    this."

                    Penn Engineers have developed a new chip that uses light
                    waves, rather than electricity, to perform the complex math
                    essential to training AI. The chip has the potential to
                    radically accelerate the processing speed of computers while
                    also reducing their energy consumption.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The interaction of light waves with matter represents
                    one possible avenue for developing computers that supersede
                    the limitations of today's chips, which are essentially
                    based on the same principles as chips from the earliest days
                    of the computing revolution in the 1960s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Instead of using a silicon wafer of uniform height,
                    explains Engheta, "you make the silicon thinner, say 150
                    nanometers," but only in specific regions. Those variations
                    in height -- without the addition of any other materials --
                    provide a means of controlling the propagation of light
                    through the chip, since the variations in height can be
                    distributed to cause light to scatter in specific patterns,
                    allowing the chip to perform mathematical calculations at
                    the speed of light.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] this design is already ready for commercial
                    applications, and could potentially be adapted for use in
                    graphics processing units (GPUs), the demand for which has
                    skyrocketed with the widespread interest in developing new
                    AI systems. "They can adopt the Silicon Photonics platform
                    as an add-on," says Aflatouni, "and then you could speed up
                    training and classification."

                purchase. The company reconfigured and modernized its SM-2
                missile factory to increase production efficiencies. It also
                signed new agreements with several suppliers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The missile was originally made in the 1960s, while the newest
                re-design is from the 1970s. I assume the production restart has
                newish SMT equivalent of the original parts. Probably not going
                too well.

                  <p>
                    An experimental new forensic spray allows latent
                    fingerprints to be made visible in just 10 seconds, plus it
                    doesn't require the use of any messy powders. What it does
                    incorporate, however, is a glowing protein that's obtained
                    from jellyfish.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Current methods of lifting fingerprints from crime scenes
                    utilize fine powders or fuming chemical reagents. In both
                    cases, obtaining a usable print takes at least a few
                    minutes. Additionally, compounds in the powders or reagents
                    may damage DNA in the sweat or skin oil that makes up the
                    print.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists from Britain's University of Bath and China's
                    Shanghai Normal University have now come up with an
                    alternative, in the form of the new non-toxic, water-soluble
                    spray.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As soon as the spray has been applied to a surface, the
                    positively-charged dye molecules bind with
                    negatively-charged fatty or amino acid molecules in the
                    fingerprint sweat or oil. The dye molecules are then "locked
                    in place" along all the telltale whorls and ridges of the
                    print.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Both dyes are derived from a substance produced by
                    jellyfish, called Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). That
                    protein is already widely used in scientific studies to
                    visualize biological processes, without affecting those
                    processes. It likewise doesn't affect the DNA which may be
                    present in fingerprints.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When exposed to blue light, those molecules fluoresce in
                    their yellow or red color within no more than 10 seconds. A
                    smartphone camera can then be used to record their images
                    for subsequent reference.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are actually two versions of it containing two
                    different dyes, namely LFP-Yellow and LFP-Red. Users choose
                    one or the other depending on the color of the surface from
                    which they're lifting prints, so that the prints really
                    stand out against their background when made visible.

                    At least 100 instances of malicious AI ML models were found
                    on the Hugging Face platform, some of which can execute code
                    on the victim's machine, giving attackers a persistent
                    backdoor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hugging Face is a tech firm engaged in artificial
                    intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), and
                    machine learning (ML), providing a platform where
                    communities can collaborate and share models, datasets, and
                    complete applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    JFrog's security team found that roughly a hundred models
                    hosted on the platform feature malicious functionality,
                    posing a significant risk of data breaches and espionage
                    attacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This happens despite Hugging Face's security measures,
                    including malware, pickle, and secrets scanning, and
                    scrutinizing the models' functionality to discover behaviors
                    like unsafe deserialization.

                    Today is February 29, an unusual day in that it is added to
                    the common 28 in years that are multiples of four to keep
                    the calendar in sync with the astronomical year.

                    This kludge prevents our seasons from drifting out of whack,
                    but it presents a problem for computers and software, which
                    have to be programmed to account for the extra day to avoid
                    error conditions and incorrect data.

                    We are all using a computer of one sort or another to read
                    this and hopefully nothing has caught fire, yet every leap
                    year, something somewhere falls over hard.

                    it was payment systems at fuel pumps that have just
                    staggered back to their feet after a nationwide outage
                    lasting more than ten hours.

                    OpenAI said in a filing in Manhattan federal court on Monday
                    that the Times caused the technology to reproduce its
                    material through "deceptive prompts that blatantly violate
                    OpenAI's terms of use."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The allegations in the Times's complaint do not meet its
                    famously rigorous journalistic standards," OpenAI said. "The
                    truth, which will come out in the course of this case, is
                    that the Times paid someone to hack OpenAI's products."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    OpenAI did not name the "hired gun" who it said the Times
                    used to manipulate its systems and did not accuse the
                    newspaper of breaking any anti-hacking laws.

                    whether AI training qualifies as fair use under copyright
                    law. So far, judges have dismissed some infringement claims
                    over the output of generative AI systems based on a lack of
                    evidence that AI-created content resembles copyrighted

                    Evolution has produced a wondrously diverse variety of
                    lifeforms here on Earth. It just so happens that talking
                    primates with opposable thumbs rose to the top and are
                    building a spacefaring civilization. And we're
                    land-dwellers. But what about other planets? If the dominant
                    species on an ocean world builds a technological
                    civilization of some sort, would they be able to escape
                    their ocean home and explore space?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A new article in the Journal of the British Interplanetary
                    Society examines the idea of civilizations on other worlds
                    and the factors that govern their ability to explore their
                    solar systems. Its title is "<a

                      >Introducing the Exoplanet Escape Factor and the Fishbowl
                      Worlds (Two conceptual tools for the search of
                      extra-terrestrial civilizations)</a
                    >." The sole author is Elio Quiroga, a professor at the
                    Universidad del Atlántico Medio in Spain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We have no way of knowing if other Extraterrestrial
                    Intelligences (ETIs) exist or not. There's at least some
                    possibility that other civilizations exist, and we're
                    certainly in no position to say for sure that they don't.
                    The Drake Equation is one of the tools we use to talk about
                    the existence of ETIs. It's a kind of structured thought
                    experiment in the form of an equation that allows us to
                    estimate the existence of other active, communicative ETIs.
                    Some of the variables in the Drake Equation (DE) are the
                    star formation rate, the number of planets around those
                    stars, and the fraction of planets that could form life and
                    on which life could evolve to become an ETI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In his new research article, Quiroga comes up with two new
                    concepts that feed into the DE: the Exoplanet Escape Factor
                    and Fishbowl worlds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Quiroga's Exoplanet Escape Factor (Fex) can help us
                    imagine what kinds of worlds could host ETIs. It can help us
                    anticipate the factors that prevent or at least inhibit
                    space travel, and it brings more complexity into the Drake
                    Equation. It leads us to the idea of Fishbowl Worlds,
                    inescapable planets that could keep a civilization
                    planet-bound forever.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Without the ability to ever escape their planet and explore
                    their solar systems, and without the ability to communicate
                    beyond their worlds, could entire civilizations rise and
                    fall without ever knowing the Universe they were a part of?
                    Could it happen right under our noses, so to speak, and we'd
                    never know ?

                  <p>
                    At a time when one viral video can damage a business, some
                    companies are turning to their own commenting platforms
                    rather than letting social media be the main outlet for
                    customer feedback. Only one wrinkle: in this context,
                    customers appear to prefer writing a message rather than
                    leaving a video.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a recent study, more participants indicated they would
                    likely leave written compliments or complaints about service
                    on a restaurant-provided tablet powered by artificial
                    intelligence. A video message option appeared to discourage
                    leaving feedback.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With more restaurants and hotels turning to AI to enhance
                    their service, the findings indicate that methods that
                    require "low self-disclosure" would work better, meaning
                    ones that don't require customers to provide very much
                    identifiable information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Some restaurants and hotels actually ask customers to
                    create video testimonials that they can share, but for
                    general customers, it seems they still feel more comfortable
                    with low self-disclosure. This is probably because people
                    still do not trust AI to that level," said lead author
                    Ruiying Cai, a researcher in Washington State University's
                    Carson College of Business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With a lot of hype around AI technology, many people have
                    misperceptions about what it can do, Cai pointed out,
                    perhaps believing it is capable of a lot more than simply
                    recording a message.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study participants reported being concerned about what
                    would be done with their information in all the scenarios,
                    but this was heightened with the option to leave a video.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers found that the participants were more
                    willing to give feedback using text, whether positive or
                    negative.

                    harmony with local melodies from the Middle East, India, and
                    other parts of the world. That can be more or less
                    successful, but one problem is that notes can sound
                    dissonant if you play them with Western instruments."

                    The dump of scores of documents late last week and
                    subsequent investigation were confirmed by two employees of
                    I-Soon, known as Anxun in Mandarin, which has ties to the
                    powerful Ministry of Public Security. The dump, which
                    analysts consider highly significant even if it does not
                    reveal any especially novel or potent tools, includes
                    hundreds of pages of contracts, marketing presentations,

                    A day after American fast food chain Wendy's announced plans
                    to test dynamic pricing and AI menu features in 2025, the
                    company clarified its plans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wendy's said it will not dynamically raise menu prices based
                    on demand after reports about the experiment, which was set
                    to roll out in 2025, caused a stir online. In a statement to
                    <a
                      href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/wendys-will-not-implement-surge-pricing-ceo-comment-causes-online-stir-2024-02-28/"
                      >Reuters</a
                    >, a Wendy's spokesperson said it "would not raise prices
                    when our customers are visiting us most." Instead, the
                    company framed experimental price changes as discounts
                    during "slower times of day."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We said these menuboards would give us more flexibility to
                    change the display of featured items. This was misconstrued
                    in some media reports as an intent to raise prices when
                    demand is highest," the company told Reuters. "We have no
                    plans to do that."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Presuming that lowered prices during slow times will
                    eventually rise again, it appears some sort of dynamic
                    pricing will still be taking place.

                    throughout the day depending on demand, similar to "surge
                    pricing" in rideshare apps like Uber and Lyft. The
                    initiative was disclosed by Kirk Tanner, the CEO and
                    president of Wendy's, in a recent discussion with analysts.

                  <p>
                    [...] In conversation with Food &amp; Wine, a spokesperson
                    for Wendy's confirmed the company's commitment to this
                    pricing strategy, describing it as part of a broader effort
                    to grow its digital business. "Beginning as early as 2025,
                    we will begin testing a variety of enhanced features on
                    these digital menuboards like dynamic pricing, different
                    offerings in certain parts of the day, AI-enabled menu
                    changes and suggestive selling based on factors such as
                    weather," they said. "Dynamic pricing can allow Wendy's to
                    be competitive and flexible with pricing, motivate customers
                    to visit and provide them with the food they love at a great
                    value. We will test a number of features that we think will
                    provide an enhanced customer and crew experience."

                potential user how it will work, and in this role it does a
                reasonable job. But there is not a great deal to explain why
                they think it is a game changer, or why it will appeal to many
                users. If it is necessary to use Lisp to extend the browser then
                perhaps it will not have the impact that they seem to believe it
                will have. But what do you think? Will it gain a foothold, or
                simply fade away to be forgotten except perhaps for a few

                    senior management and other members of the organization on
                    safety culture. Interviewees, including ODA [Organization

                    questioned whether Boeing's safety reporting systems would
                    function in a way that ensures open communication and
                    non-retaliation. The Expert Panel also observed inadequate

                    not structured in a way that ensures all employees
                    understand their role in the company's SMS. The procedures
                    and training are complex and in a constant state of change,
                    creating employee confusion especially among different work
                    sites and employee groups. The Expert Panel also found a
                    lack of awareness of safety-related metrics at all levels of
                    the organization; employees had difficulty distinguishing
                    the differences among various measuring methods, their
                    purpose, and outcomes.

                  <p>
                    Boeing's restructuring of the management of the ODA unit
                    decreased opportunities for interference and retaliation
                    against UMs, and provides effective organizational messaging
                    regarding independence of UMs. However, the restructuring,
                    while better, still allows opportunities for retaliation to
                    occur, particularly with regards to salary and furlough
                    ranking. This influences the ability of UMs to execute their
                    delegated functions effectively.

                    rocket that launched a climate satellite in 2009. Weighing
                    three metric tons and as big as a bus, it orbits our planet
                    at an altitude of 600 kilometers (373 miles). If left
                    untended it will remain in orbit for decades, says Lewis,
                    before the atmospheric drag of our planet is able to pull it
                    back into the atmosphere. At that point it will burn up,
                    with any remnants most likely falling into the ocean.

                    ADRAS-J's mission is to figure out how to pull it back into
                    the atmosphere before that happens. Sidling up to the
                    rocket, the spacecraft will use cameras and sensors to
                    inspect it from as near as

                    it is intact or if pieces have broken off and are drifting
                    nearby, and also look for grapple points where a future
                    spacecraft could attach.

                    "Designing a servicer to go up and grapple a three-ton piece
                    of debris comes with a lot of challenges," says Mike
                    Lindsay, Astroscale's chief technology officer. "The biggest
                    challenge is dealing with the amount of uncertainty. The
                    object has been up there for 15 years. It's uncontrolled.
                    We're not communicating with it. So we don't know how it's
                    moving, how it looks, and how it's aged."

                    $800 million worth of revenue in 2023, up from $666.7
                    million in 2022.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the company remains unprofitable on both a GAAP and
                    adjusted basis, and continues to consume cash to fund its
                    operations. Scale has not yet solved the profitability
                    question for Reddit, which could limit its potential
                    valuation when it does list its shares.

                  <p>
                    In 2022, Reddit generated a net loss of $158.6 million and
                    had an adjusted EBITDA of negative $108.4 million. In 2023,
                    those figures improved to a $90.8 million net loss and $69.3
                    million worth of negative adjusted EBITDA. The company's
                    free cash flow improved from –$100.3 million to –$84.8
                    million over the same timeframe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company may be making progress toward stemming the red
                    ink that is missed in its annual figures. In the final
                    quarter of 2023, Reddit not only posted what was at least a
                    local maximum in revenue terms — $249.8 million — but also a
                    net profit of $18.5 million. While the GAAP profit is
                    notable for the fourth quarter, the company's free cash flow
                    was still negative in the period, ending the three-month
                    period at –$22 million.

                    while its Series F took it to a roughly $10 billion

                  <p>
                    Both of those bubble-era valuations will be tested in
                    Reddit's now quickly forthcoming IPO. But the company's
                    debut will be more than a test for certain private-market
                    startup valuations. Reddit is reportedly trying something
                    novel in its own flotation.

                    In what is broadly viewed as an unorthodox move, Reddit
                    reportedly plans to reserve an undetermined number of shares
                    for 75,000 of its users, according to the

                    will be given the chance to scoop up shares of Reddit at its
                    IPO price before the stock even begins trading — something
                    typically reserved only for large investors.

                    [....] In seeking ways to optimize classical computing, Sels
                    and his colleagues at the Simons Foundation focused on a
                    type of tensor network that faithfully represents the
                    interactions between the qubits. Those types of networks
                    have been notoriously hard to deal with, but recent advances
                    in the field now allow these networks to be optimized with
                    tools borrowed from statistical inference.

                    The authors compare the work of the algorithm to the
                    compression of an image into a JPEG file, which allows large
                    images to be stored using less space by eliminating
                    information with barely perceivable loss in the quality of
                    the image.

                    Altermagnets have a special combination of the arrangement
                    of spins and crystal symmetries. The spins alternate, as in
                    antiferromagnets, resulting in no net magnetisation. Yet,
                    rather than simply cancelling out, the symmetries give an
                    electronic band structure with strong spin polarization that
                    flips in direction as you pass through the material's energy
                    bands -- hence the name altermagnets. This results in highly
                    useful properties more resemblant of ferromagnets, as well
                    as some completely new properties.

                Spintronics has promised to revolutionise IT. Typically,
                ferromagnets have been used as they offer highly desirable,
                strong, spin-dependent physical phenomena. Yet the macroscopic
                net magnetisation that is useful in so many other applications
                poses practical limitations on the scalability of these devices
                as it causes crosstalk between bits. Instead, Antiferromagnets
                have been investigated for spintronics, as they have no net
                magnetisation and thus offer ultra-scalability and energy
                efficiency. However, the strong spin-dependent effects are
                lacking, again hindering their practical applicability.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enter altermagnets with the best of both: zero net magnetisation
                together with the coveted strong spin-dependent phenomena
                typically found in ferromagnets -- merits that were regarded as
                principally incompatible.

                    The researchers believe that this new fundamental discovery
                    in magnetism will enrich our understanding of
                    condensed-matter physics, with impact across diverse areas
                    of research and technology. As well as its advantages to the
                    developing field of spintronics, it also offers a promising
                    platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity,
                    through new insights into superconducting states that can
                    arise in different magnetic materials.

                    "Altermagnetism is actually not something hugely
                    complicated. It is something entirely fundamental that was
                    in front of our eyes for decades without noticing it," says
                    Jungwirth. "And it is not something that exists only in a
                    few obscure materials. It exists in many crystals that
                    people simply had in their drawers. In that sense, now that
                    we have brought it to light, many people around the world
                    will be able to work on it, giving the potential for a broad
                    impact."

                    People who quit smoking see major gains in life expectancy
                    after just a few years, according to a new study by

                    >, published in <em>NEJM Evidence</em>, shows that smokers
                    who quit smoking before age 40 can expect to live almost as
                    long as those who never smoked. Those who quit at any age
                    return close to never-smoker survival 10 years after
                    quitting, and about half that benefit occurs within just
                    three years.

                  <p>
                    [...] Former smokers lowered their risk of death to 1.3-fold
                    (or 30 per cent higher) compared to never smokers. Stopping
                    smoking at any age was associated with longer survival, and
                    even those who quit for less than three years gained up to
                    six years in life expectancy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Many people think it's too late to quit smoking, especially
                    in middle age," said Jha. "But these results counter that
                    line of thought. It's never too late, the impact is fast and
                    you can reduce risk across major diseases, meaning a longer
                    and better quality of life."

                  <p>
                    The researchers found that quitting smoking reduced the risk
                    of dying from vascular disease and cancer, in particular.
                    Former smokers also reduced their risk of death from
                    respiratory disease, but slightly less so, likely due to
                    residual lung damage.

                    It may not be super easy to get to: "Most hydrogen is likely
                    inaccessible," Ellis told the <em>Financial Times</em>. "But
                    a few per cent recovery would still supply all projected
                    demand – 500 million tonnes a year – for hundreds of years."

                  <p>
                    Gold hydrogen won't won't hog renewable energy like
                    electrolyzers, or divert it away from other decarbonization
                    opportunities. In that sense, you could argue it'll have the
                    potential to be significantly greener than green hydrogen.
                    On the other hand, if tapping it releases methane into the
                    atmosphere, that's a serious issue; methane is around 85
                    times more powerful a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide

                    To comply with looming rules that ban tech giants from

                    products in Europe. The

                    is supposed to help smaller companies get more traffic from
                    Google, but reviews service Yelp says that when it tested
                    Google's design tweaks with consumers it had the opposite
                    effect—making people <i>less</i> likely to click through to
                    Yelp or another Google competitor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results, which Yelp shared with European regulators in
                    December and WIRED this month, put some numerical backing
                    behind complaints from Google rivals in travel, shopping,
                    and hospitality that its efforts to comply with

                    are insufficient—and potentially more harmful than the
                    status quo. Yelp and thousands of others have been demanding
                    that the EU hold a firm line against the giant companies
                    including Apple and Amazon that are subject to what's widely
                    considered the world's strictest antitrust law, violations
                    of which can draw fines of up to 10 percent of global annual
                    sales.

                  <p>
                    "All the gatekeepers are trying to hold on as long as
                    possible to the status quo and make the new world
                    unattractive," says Richard Stables, CEO of shopping
                    comparison site Kelkoo, which is unhappy with how Google has
                    tweaked shopping results to comply with the DMA. "That's
                    really the game plan."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google spokesperson Rory O'Donoghue says the more than 20
                    changes made to search in response to the DMA are providing
                    more opportunities for services such as Yelp to show up in
                    results. "To suggest otherwise is plain wrong," he says.
                    Overall, Google's tests of various DMA-inspired designs show
                    clicks to review and comparison websites are up, O'Donoghue
                    says—at the cost of users losing shortcuts to Google tools
                    and individual businesses like airlines and restaurants
                    facing a drop in visits from Google search. "We've been
                    seeking feedback from a range of stakeholders over many
                    months as we try to balance the needs of different types of
                    websites while complying with the law," he says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google, which generates 30 percent of its sales from Europe,
                    the Middle East, and Africa, views the DMA as disrespecting
                    its expertise in what users want. Critics such as Yelp argue
                    that Google sometimes siphons users away from the more
                    reliable content they offer. Yelp competes with Google for
                    advertisers but generated less than 1 percent of its record
                    sales of $1.3 billion last year from outside the US. An
                    increase in European traffic could significantly boost its
                    business.

                    part of Invenda's expansion into North America. It was only

                    Invenda could push for expansive global growth that
                    seemingly vastly expands its smart vending machines' data

                    "The funding round indicates confidence among Invenda's core

                    Twitter employees prevented Elon Musk from violating the

                    according to Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan.

                    FTC staff deposed former Twitter employees and "learned that

                    out to be more limited than the individuals' tweets and

                    sent today to US Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). Khan's letter
                    said the access was limited because employees refused to
                    comply with Musk's demands:

                        The deposition testimony revealed that in early December
                        2022, Elon Musk had reportedly directed staff to grant
                        an outside third-party individual "full access to
                        everything at Twitter... No limits at all." Consistent
                        with Musk's direction, the individual was initially
                        assigned a company laptop and internal account, with the
                        intent that the third-party individual be given
                        "elevated privileges" beyond what an average company
                        employee might have.

                      <p>
                        However, based on a concern that such an arrangement
                        would risk exposing nonpublic user information in
                        potential violation of the FTC's Order, longtime
                        information security employees at Twitter intervened and
                        implemented safeguards to mitigate the risks. Ultimately
                        the third-party individuals did not receive direct
                        access to Twitter's systems, but instead worked with
                        other company employees who accessed the systems on the
                        individuals' behalf.

                    that "the FTC harassed Twitter in the wake of Mr. Musk's
                    acquisition." Khan's letter to Jordan today argues that the
                    FTC investigation was justified.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The FTC's investigation confirmed that staff was right to
                    be concerned, given that Twitter's new CEO had directed
                    employees to take actions that would have violated the FTC's
                    Order," Khan wrote. "Once staff learned that the FTC's Order
                    had worked to ensure that Twitter employees took appropriate
                    measures to protect consumers' private information,
                    compliance staff made no further inquiries to Twitter or
                    anyone else concerning this issue."

                  <p>
                    Khan also wrote that deep staff cuts following the Musk
                    acquisition, and resignations of Twitter's top privacy and
                    compliance officials, meant that "there was no one left at
                    the company responsible for interpreting and modifying data
                    policies and practices to ensure Twitter was complying with
                    the FTC's Order to safeguard Americans' personal data." The

                    Occasionally when Signal is in the press and getting a lot
                    of favorable discussion, I feel the need to step into
                    various forums, IRC channels, and so on, and explain why I
                    don't trust Signal. Let's do a blog post instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Off the bat, let me explain that I expect a tool which
                    claims to be secure to actually be secure. I don't view "but
                    that makes it harder for the average person" as an
                    acceptable excuse. If Edward Snowden and Bruce Schneier are
                    going to spout the virtues of the app, I expect it to
                    <em>actually</em> be secure when it matters - when
                    vulnerable people using it to encrypt sensitive
                    communications are targeted by smart and powerful
                    adversaries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Making promises about security without explaining the
                    tradeoffs you made in order to appeal to the average user is
                    unethical. Tradeoffs are necessary - but self-serving
                    tradeoffs are not, and it's your responsibility to clearly
                    explain the drawbacks and advantages of the tradeoffs you
                    make. If you make broad and inaccurate statements about your
                    communications product being "secure", then when the
                    political prisoners who believed you are being tortured and
                    hanged, it's on you. The stakes are serious. Let me explain
                    why I don't think Signal takes them seriously.

                    Amphisbaenians are strange creatures. Like worms with
                    vertebrae, scales, a large central tooth and sometimes small
                    forearms, these reptiles live underground, burrowing tunnels
                    and preying on just about anything they encounter, not
                    unlike a miniature version of the monstrous sandworms from

                    they cannot be observed while in their natural habitat under
                    sand and soil. But thanks to two papers published in the

                    like little snakes in the way that they move and interact.
                    It's just surprising for something that's so tiny. You just
                    don't expect that behavior," Lewis said.

                    Some of the most striking imagery to come from these CT
                    scans highlights sutures within the skull: deep, thin waves
                    that "grab" on to each other, Lewis described. The images
                    also render in exquisite details the amphisbaenians' strange
                    singular central tooth, which interlocks with two bottom
                    teeth.

                    "Combined with the powerful jaw muscles in amphisbaenians,
                    it gives them a ferocious bite for an animal of their size.
                    They can bite and tear out pieces of their prey," Bell said.

                    I've written before about my nostalgia for the Windows XP-
                    or Windows 7-era "clean install," when you could
                    substantially improve any given pre-made PC merely by taking
                    an official direct-from-Microsoft Windows install disk and
                    blowing away the factory install, ridding yourself of 60-day
                    antivirus trials, WildTangent games, outdated drivers, and
                    whatever other software your PC maker threw on it to help
                    subsidize its cost.

                    You can still do that with Windows 11—in fact, it's
                    considerably easier than it was in those '00s versions of
                    Windows, with multiple official Microsoft-sanctioned ways to
                    download and create an install disk, something you used to
                    need to acquire on your own. But the resulting Windows
                    installation is a lot less "clean" than it used to be, given
                    the continual creep of new Microsoft apps and services into
                    more and more parts of the core Windows experience. [...]

                I am a long-time macOS user, and willingly pay the hefty Apple
                "tax" to use it because macOS behaves itself, but I am forced to
                use Windows 11 at work and I hate it for many of the reasons
                outlined in this article. Windows, like DOS before it decades
                ago, has become a boot-sector virus. Windows delenda est!

                    ...<br />"The DRD4/7R allele has been linked to greater food
                    and drug cravings, novelty-seeking, and ADHD symptoms,"
                    explained study leader Dan Eisenberg back in 2008. "It is
                    possible that in the nomadic setting, a boy with this allele
                    might be able to more effectively defend livestock against
                    raiders or locate food and water sources, but that the same
                    tendencies might not be as beneficial in settled pursuits
                    such as focusing in school, farming or selling goods."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So a fascinating hypothesis emerged. Could the genetic
                    traits of ADHD be somewhat beneficial to a tribe by pushing
                    some people to be 'explorers'? What manifests in modern
                    times as fidgety restlessness could actually have been
                    useful to tribes foraging the countryside for food.<br />...<br />Around
                    450 people participated in the experiment, and all were
                    simultaneously screened for ADHD symptoms. Unsurprisingly,
                    the researchers found those with higher ADHD scores moved on
                    to new bushes sooner than others but more importantly, those
                    with ADHD also tended to collect higher volumes of berries
                    overall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Writing in the newly published study, Barack and colleagues
                    noted that participants without ADHD characteristics tended
                    to over-harvest single patches. Looking at what would be an
                    optimal harvest strategy for the game it was discovered that
                    players with high ADHD scores were more successful overall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In addition, we discovered that participants that screened
                    positive for ADHD more readily abandoned patches and
                    achieved higher reward rates than did participants who
                    screened negative," the researchers concluded. "Given the
                    over-staying displayed by participants overall, those with
                    elevated ASRS scores made exploratory decisions that were
                    more closely aligned with the predictions of optimal
                    foraging theory, and, in this sense, behaved more
                    optimally."

                OS/2 was a joint operating system project by IBM and Microsoft,
                which was intended for IBM's own Personal System/2 (PS/2) PCs.
                (If you've ever seen the old circular ports used by keyboards
                and mice on old PCs, those are also called PS/2 ports— because
                they're inherited from this.)
              </p>
              <p>
                While OS/2 comes after the original IBM PC DOS and MS-DOS, we
                know today that the partnership between IBM and Microsoft would
                not last in that form. Microsoft eventually stopped working with
                IBM in 1992 when it dropped Windows 3.1, a direct competitor of
                the OS/2 software IBM paid it to make.
              </p>
              <p>
                OS/2 was intended as a protected-mode successor of PC DOS
                targeting the Intel 80286 processor. Notably, basic system calls
                were modeled after MS-DOS calls; their names even started with
                "Dos" and it was possible to create "Family Mode" applications –
                text mode applications that could work on both systems. Because
                of this heritage, OS/2 shares similarities with Unix, Xenix, and
                Windows NT.
              </p>
              <p>
                Up to $990 million per year was spent developing OS/2 and its
                replacement. OS/2 sales were largely concentrated in networked
                computing used by corporate professionals; however, by the early
                1990s, it was overtaken by Microsoft Windows NT. While OS/2 was
                arguably technically superior to Microsoft Windows 95, OS/2
                failed to develop much penetration in the mass market consumer
                and stand-alone desktop PC segments.
              </p>
              <p>
                IBM discontinued its support for OS/2 on December 31, 2006.
                Since then, OS/2 has been developed, supported and sold by two
                different third-party vendors under license from IBM – first by
                Serenity Systems as eComStation since 2001, and later by Arca
                Noae LLC as ArcaOS since 2017.
              </p>

                If you're reading this before April 15, 2024, and wish to dig
                into OS/2 computing history, you're also advised to check out
                the Hobbes OS/2 Archive while it still exists. The Hobbes OS/2
                Archive is the longest-lived host of OS/2 software, but the
                decades have finally caught up to it, and it's set to close in
                April.<br />

                and like 10 diskettes. I didn't have a CD drive at the time, so
                had to install from the many diskettes, which didn't always
                install failure free. Finally got it installed and tried it out
                some, but, again if memory serves, had so little hard-drive
                space that i couldn't install much else to fool with to test
                compatibility.

                Then Windows Whatever came along (remember "Start me up" from
                the Rolling Stones?) and then finally found Linux and never
                looked back.

                    If you're swiping on dating apps for hours, you're not alone

                    Dating apps such as Tinder and Hinge are intentionally
                    addictive, a class-action lawsuit filed in federal court in
                    California on Valentine's Day claims.

                    Hidden algorithms push users to stay on the apps and "gamify
                    dating" — counterintuitive to the apps' intended purpose to
                    help people find connections and form relationships, six

                    For the supermassive black hole's size, the researchers
                    propose two possible estimates: one at 17 billion solar
                    masses, and the other at 19 billion solar masses. That's not
                    the most massive one known, but there are only about a dozen
                    thought to be larger. (For comparison, the one at the center
                    of the Milky Way is "only" about 4 million solar masses.)
                    The data is best fit by a moderate spin, with us viewing it
                    from about 45 degrees off the pole of the black hole. The
                    accretion disk would be roughly seven light-years across.
                    Meaning, if the system were centered on our Sun, several
                    nearby stars would be within the disk.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The accretion rate needed to power the brightness is just
                    below the Eddington limit and works out to roughly 370 solar
                    masses of material per year. Or, about a Sun a day. At that
                    rate, it would take about 30 million years to double in
                    size.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The whole accretion disk is also large enough that it
                    should be possible to image it with the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/"
                      >Very Large Telescope</a
                    >, which would allow us to track the disk's rotation and
                    estimate the black hole's mass.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The system's extreme nature, then, may actually help us
                    figure out its details despite its immense distance.
                    Meanwhile, the researchers wonder whether other unusual
                    systems might remain undiscovered simply because we haven't
                    considered that an object might be a quasar instead of a
                    star.

                    Bianchini was a professor of mathematics and astronomy at
                    the University of Ferrara, but he also had a background in
                    what we'd now call finance – he was a merchant, and managed
                    assets and investments for a wealthy ruling family of the
                    time. That real-world experience seems to have influenced
                    his mathematical work, since Bianchini was known to have
                    created his own system of dividing measurement units like
                    feet into 10 equal parts to make them easier to work with.
                    As fundamental as it feels to modern sensibilities, it
                    didn't catch on with the 15th century crowd who were used to
                    a base-60 system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, Dr. Glen Van Brummelen, a professor at Trinity Western
                    University in Canada, has discovered that Bianchini
                    illustrated this system with a decimal point, the first
                    ever. Van Brummelen found that in a manuscript called
                    Tabulae primi mobilis B, Bianchini was using numbers with
                    dots in the middle – the first one being 10.4 – and showing
                    how to multiply them, something that was tricky in a base-60
                    system.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    jump in AI-video quality over the past year compared to the

                    We have not yet seen a model with the capability of Sora
                    attempt to create a new Will-Smith-eating-spaghetti AI
                    video, but the result would likely be far better than what
                    we saw last year, even if it contained obvious glitches.
