                    The misinformation campaign was carried out by a group of
                    conspirators, prosecutors said, including a man in his 20s
                    who called himself Ricky Vaughn. On Monday he will go on
                    trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn under his real
                    name, Douglass Mackey, after being charged with conspiring
                    to spread misinformation designed to deprive others of their
                    right to vote.

                  <p>
                    Prosecutors have said that Mr. Mackey, who went to
                    Middlebury College in Vermont and said he lived on the Upper
                    East Side of Manhattan, used hashtags and memes as part of
                    his deception and outlined his strategies publicly on
                    Twitter and with co-conspirators in private Twitter group
                    chats.

                    [...] Mr. Mackey's trial is expected to provide a window
                    into a small part of what the authorities have described as
                    broad efforts to sway the 2016 election through lies and
                    disinformation. While some of those attempts were
                    orchestrated by Russian security services, others were said
                    to have emanated from American internet trolls.

                    This week, NASA announced it has selected the company
                    Firefly Aerospace to develop a commercial lander for the far
                    side of the moon. The lander, called Blue Ghost, will be
                    used to deliver several NASA payloads to the moon, including
                    a radio observation mission which is placed on the far side
                    of the moon to minimize the radio noise coming from Earth.
                    This natural radio quiet zone will let the Lunar Surface
                    Electromagnetics Experiment-Night (LuSEE-Night) telescope
                    detect faint radio waves from an early period of the
                    universe known as the cosmic dark ages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As well as LuSEE-Night, Firefly will also be tasked
                    with carrying a communications and data relay satellite
                    called Lunar Pathfinder, which is a collaboration between
                    NASA and the European Space Agency, and which will be
                    deployed into orbit before the lander sets down on the
                    moon's surface. In addition, the NASA User Terminal payload
                    will assist with communications, and there will be up to
                    seven other payloads from private companies included as
                    well.

                    [...] Firefly had a troubled start to its orbital ambitions
                    when its first attempt to reach orbit with its Alpha rocket
                    in September 2021
                    <a
                      href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/space/watch-fireflys-alpha-rocket-explode-just-after-liftoff/"
                      >ended in an explosive failure</a
                    >. But a year later, its second attempt at orbital launch
                    was
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2022/10/firefly-to-the-black/"

                    >
                    and the rocket was able to deploy its orbital payloads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The aim is for Firefly to launch its lunar mission, Blue
                    Ghost Mission 1, in 2024.

                  <p>
                    Air pollution is a major public health problem: The World
                    Health Organization has estimated that it leads to over 4
                    million premature deaths worldwide annually. Still, it is
                    not always extensively measured. But now an MIT research
                    team is rolling out an open-source version of a low-cost,
                    mobile pollution detector that could enable people to track
                    air quality more widely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The detector, called Flatburn, can be made by 3D printing or
                    by ordering inexpensive parts. The researchers have now
                    tested and calibrated it in relation to existing
                    state-of-the-art machines, and are publicly releasing all
                    the information about it - how to build it, use it, and
                    interpret the data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Flatburn concept at Senseable City Lab dates back to
                    about 2017, when MIT researchers began prototyping a mobile
                    pollution detector, originally to be deployed on garbage
                    trucks in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The detectors are
                    battery-powered and rechargable, either from power sources
                    or a solar panel, with data stored on a card in the device
                    that can be accessed remotely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In both cases, the detectors were set up to measure
                    concentrations of fine particulate matter as well as
                    nitrogen dioxide, over an area of about 10 meters. Fine
                    particular matter refers to tiny particles often associated
                    with burning matter, from power plants, internal combustion
                    engines in autos and fires, and more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The goal is for community groups or individual citizens
                    anywhere to be able to measure local air pollution, identify
                    its sources, and, ideally, create feedback loops with
                    officials and stakeholders to create cleaner conditions,"
                    says Carlo Ratti, director of MIT's Senseable City Lab.

                    [...] Living in the Swedish capital Stockholm, the
                    33-year-old regularly travels by rail, not only to visit her
                    family in Luxembourg, but also to her holiday destinations.

                    She favours train travel over flying mainly for
                    environmental reasons. Yet she adds that trains are simply
                    more enjoyable, especially sleeper services.

                  <p>
                    [...] The carbon footprint is just a fraction of a flight.
                    Flying from Stockholm to Hamburg results in around 250kg of
                    carbon dioxide emissions per passenger,

                    By contrast, the C02 released by travelling via
                    electric-powered train is just 26kg.

                    The SJ night train has nine coaches, and capacity to carry
                    400 passengers. Dan Olofsson, head of tendered services at
                    SJ, says the new service was proposed by the Swedish
                    government, "as they wanted to move more people towards
                    climate-friendly travelling, and one of the solutions was
                    the night train between Sweden and Germany".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The service is powered by renewable energy, and Mr Olofsson
                    says it is typically being used by Swedes to connect them to
                    other rail services from Hamburg.

                  <p>
                    "Hamburg isn't the main destination for most travellers, but
                    is an important hub for people to reach more destinations in
                    Germany and France and so on," he says.

                    [...] However, depending on the location, and especially if
                    starting from the UK, travelling by train can often be more
                    expensive than flying. Trains fares in the UK can in fact be
                    50% more costly than flights,

                    in particular should be taken with a grain of salt since AMD
                    has loads of products in the pipeline.

                    The alleged Phoenix 2 processor with two Zen 4 cores and
                    four Zen 4c cores has been running MilkyWay@Home client
                    since early March, which indicates that someone within AMD
                    or even outside of the company is test driving the chip.
                    This may be a sign that the CPU will be released in the
                    foreseeable future, though it is unclear when exactly.
                    Meanwhile, based on unofficial information, AMD is set to
                    release its Phoenix 2 APUs in the second half of 2023.

                    Whether we're night owls or morning larks, our body clocks
                    are set by the sun. Theoretically, changing day length and
                    light exposure over the course of the year could affect the
                    duration and quality of our sleep. But figuring out how this
                    applies in practice is difficult. Although studies where
                    people assess their own sleep have suggested an increase in
                    sleep duration during winter, objective measures are needed
                    to determine how exactly the seasons affect sleep.
                    Scientists studying sleep difficulties have now published
                    data in
                    <em
                      ><a

                    that shows that, even in an urban population experiencing
                    disrupted sleep, humans experience longer REM sleep in
                    winter than summer and less deep sleep in autumn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Possibly one of the most precious achievements in human
                    evolution is an almost invisibility of seasonality on the
                    behavioral level," said Dr Dieter Kunz, corresponding author
                    of the study, based at the Clinic of Sleep &amp;
                    Chronomedicine at the St Hedwig Hospital, Berlin. "In our
                    study we show that human sleep architecture varies
                    substantially across seasons in an adult population living
                    in an urban environment."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Even though the patients were based in an urban
                    environment with low natural light exposure and high light
                    pollution, which should affect any seasonality regulated by
                    light, the scientists found subtle but striking changes
                    across the seasons. Although total sleep time appeared to be
                    about an hour longer in the winter than the summer, this
                    result was not statistically significant. However, REM sleep
                    was 30 minutes longer in the winter than in summer. REM
                    sleep is known to be directly linked to the circadian clock,
                    which is affected by changing light. Although the team
                    acknowledged that these results would need to be validated
                    in a population which experiences no sleep difficulties, the
                    seasonal changes may be even greater in a healthy
                    population.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Seasonality is ubiquitous in any living being on this
                    planet," said Kunz. "Even though we still perform unchanged,
                    over the winter human physiology is down-regulated, with a
                    sensation of 'running-on-empty' in February or March. In
                    general, societies need to adjust sleep habits including
                    length and timing to season, or adjust school and working
                    schedules to seasonal sleep needs."

                    The tricky issue is that there is no simple way to read out
                    how much fuel remains, so engineers use methods like heating
                    up the tank and seeing how long it takes to reach a
                    temperature, which indicates how much mass is inside. This
                    method had been used to calculate the low amount of
                    remaining fuel, so either there was a leak in the spacecraft
                    or else the measurement was wrong.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "First, we had to verify the spacecraft was OK," said Joseph
                    Hunt, Odyssey's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion
                    Laboratory, in a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/engineers-keep-an-eye-on-fuel-supply-of-nasas-oldest-mars-orbiter"
                      >statement</a
                    >. "After ruling out the possibility of a leak or that we
                    were burning more fuel than estimated, we started looking at
                    our measuring process."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After examining the systems, the team found that the issue
                    was to do with how the spacecraft heats up and cools down.
                    Because electronics need to be kept warm to operate properly
                    in the cold space environment, Odyssey uses heaters to keep
                    parts including the fuel tanks warm. But these heaters were
                    also warming the fuel within the tanks, so when the team
                    performed their thermal measurements to estimate remaining
                    fuel, it looked like there was less fuel inside than there
                    actually was.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our method of measurement was fine. The problem was that
                    the fluid dynamics occurring on board Odyssey are more
                    complicated than we thought," Jared Call, Odyssey's mission
                    manager, said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The good news is that with the heat accounted for, Odyssey
                    has at least 9 pounds of fuel left, which should last until
                    at least the end of 2025. So Odyssey will be able to
                    continue observing Mars and may even make it to a 25-year
                    anniversary.

                I just bought my second Haas CNC mill. I use them primarily to
                make parts for implantable medical devices, but they could just
                as easily make parts for small arms, guided missiles, or
                aircraft. Most big names in CNC machine tools are Eastern;
                Japanese, Taiwanese, or Chinese, with a few European. Haas, the
                biggest and most well known Western manufacturer of CNC machine
                tools, stands accused of continuing to supply Russian companies
                involved in military manufacturing, long after the beginning of
                the Russo-Ukrainian war.

                    Swear words across different languages may tend to lack
                    certain sounds such as <em>l</em>, <em>r</em>, and
                    <em>w</em>, suggests research published in
                    <em>Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review</em>. This common
                    pattern in profanity indicates that these sounds, called
                    approximants, may appear less offensive to listeners.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Swear words are thought to have sounds that help facilitate
                    the expression of emotion and attitude, but no study to date
                    has investigated if there is a universal pattern in the
                    sound of swearing across different languages.

                    [...] The authors asked 215 participants (from across six
                    different languages) to rate pairs of pseudo-words
                    (imaginary words created by the authors), one of which
                    included an approximant. For example, in Albanian, the
                    authors took the word "<em>zog</em>", meaning
                    "<em>bird</em>", and changed this to "<em>yog</em>" to
                    include an approximant and "<em>tsog</em>" without an
                    approximant. The authors found that participants were
                    significantly less likely to judge that words with
                    approximants were swear words and selected words without
                    approximants as swear words 63% of the time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a following study, the authors also looked at minced
                    oaths – which are variations of swear words deemed less
                    offensive, for example "<em>darn</em>" instead of
                    "<em>damn</em>". The authors found that approximants were
                    significantly more frequent in minced oaths than swear
                    words. The authors propose that this introduction of
                    approximants is part of what makes minced oaths less
                    offensive than swear words.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The authors conclude that their work suggests a potential
                    universal pattern to swear words across different languages,
                    with the lack of approximants a common feature when
                    perceiving swear words.

                    PCIe, also known as PCI-Express, is a highly powerful
                    interface. So let's see what it takes to hack on something
                    that powerful. PCIe is be a bit intimidating at first,
                    however it is reasonably simple to start building PCIe
                    stuff, and the interface is quite resilient for
                    hobbyist-level technology. There will come a time when we
                    want to use a PCIe chip in our designs, or perhaps, make use
                    of the PCIe connection available on a certain Compute
                    Module, and it's good to make sure that we're ready for
                    that.

                    PCIe is everywhere now. Every modern computer has a bunch of
                    PCIe devices performing crucial functions, and even iPhones
                    use PCIe internally to connect the CPU with the flash and
                    WiFi chips. You can get all kinds of PCIe devices: Ethernet
                    controllers, high-throughput WiFi cards, graphics, and all
                    the cheap NVMe drives that gladly provide you with heaps of
                    storage when connected over PCIe. If you're hacking on a
                    laptop or a single-board computer and you'd like to add a
                    PCIe device, you can get some PCIe from one of the
                    PCIe-carrying sockets, or just tap into an existing PCIe
                    link if there's no socket to connect to. It's been two
                    decades since we've started getting PCIe devices – now, PCIe
                    is on its 5.0 revision, and it's clear that it's here to
                    stay.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    PCIe is a point-to-point bus that connect two devices
                    together – as opposed to PCI, an older bus, that could
                    connect a chain of devices on your mainboard. One side of a
                    PCIe link is a device, and another is a host. For instance,
                    in a laptop, your CPU will have multiple PCIe ports – some
                    used to connect the GPU, some used to connect a WiFi card,
                    some used for Ethernet, and some used for a NVMe drive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each PCIe link consists of at least three differential pairs
                    – one is a 100 MHz clock, REFCLK, that is (almost) always
                    required for a link, and two pairs that form a PCIe lane –
                    one for transmit and another for receive. This is an x link
                    – you can also have 2x, 4x, 8x and 16x links, with four,
                    eight sixteen and thirty-two differential pairs
                    respectively, plus, again, REFCLK. The wider the link, the
                    higher its throughput!

                  <p>
                    There are four key ways to ensure the effectiveness of such
                    training and education. First, we must be able to detect
                    foreign cyber influence operations. No individual
                    organization will be able to do this on its own. Instead, we
                    will need the support of academic institutions, nonprofit
                    organizations, and other entities to better analyze and
                    report on cyber influence operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, defenses must be strengthened to account for the
                    challenges and opportunities that technology has created for
                    the world's democracies — especially when it comes to the
                    disruption of independent journalism, local news, and
                    information accuracy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another element in combating this widespread deception is
                    radical transparency. We recommend increasing both the
                    volume and dissemination of geopolitical analysis,
                    reporting, and threat intelligence to better inform
                    effective responses and protection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, there have to be consequences when nation-states
                    violate international rules. While it often falls on state,
                    local, and federal governments to enforce these penalties,
                    multistakeholder action can be leveraged to strengthen and
                    extend international norms. For example, Microsoft recently
                    signed onto the European Commission's Code of Practice on
                    Disinformation along with more than 30 online businesses to
                    collectively tackle this growing challenge. Governments can
                    build on these norms and laws to advance accountability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, threat actors are only going to continue getting
                    better at evading detection and influencing public opinion.
                    The latest nation-state threats and emerging trends show
                    that threat actors will keep evolving their tactics.
                    However, there are things organizations can do to improve
                    their defenses. We just need to create holistic policies
                    that public and private entities alike can use to combat
                    digital propaganda and protect our collective operations
                    against false narratives.

                  <p>
                    There has been an expectation that ChatGPT could assist in
                    creating database queries, just as it can assist in creating
                    computer programs. However, creating database queries
                    requires an understanding of the database itself, and there
                    is no conventional way to represent database semantics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We present a solution to this problem by developing a set of
                    syntax that can represent database semantics, such as table
                    structure and relationships, in natural language. This
                    allows for the creation of semantic representations of
                    databases that can be understood by ChatGPT and enable it to
                    perform database management tasks.

                    Experiment 2:<br />A SQL query needs to properly join four
                    tables: careplans, providers, patients, and encounters. The
                    encounters table plays a critical role here as it connects
                    the patients table with the careplans table. This
                    information is typically contained in an Entity Relationship
                    schema.

                  <p>

                    If you want a spacecraft that can explore beyond the solar
                    system—and you don't want to wait decades for it to get
                    there—you need one that can really <em>move</em>. Today's
                    chemical rockets and solar-powered probes are downright poky
                    on interstellar scales. Artur Davoyan has a completely
                    different idea for how to accelerate a spacecraft to extreme
                    speeds: pellet-beam propulsion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here's the gist of how it would work: First, you actually
                    need <em>two</em> spacecraft. A probe blasts off on a
                    one-way trip to deep space, while a second vehicle remains
                    locked in an Earth orbit and fires thousands of tiny
                    metallic pellets at its partner every second. The orbiting
                    craft also either fires a 10-megawatt laser beam at the
                    retreating probe, or aligns a laser fired from the ground at
                    it. The laser hits the pellets, heats them, and ablates
                    them, so that part of their material melts and becomes
                    plasma—a hot cloud of ionized particles. That plasma
                    accelerates the pellet remnants, and this pellet beam
                    provides thrust to the spacecraft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Alternatively, Davoyan thinks the probe could get thrust
                    from the pellet beam if the craft were to deploy an on-board
                    magnetic field-generating device to deflect the pellets. In
                    this case, that magnetic action would push the craft
                    forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such a system could boost a 1-ton probe to speeds up to
                    300,000 miles per hour. That's slow compared to the speed of
                    light, but more than 10 times faster than conventional
                    propulsion systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's a theoretical concept, but realistic enough that <a
                      href="https://www.wired.com/story/its-not-sci-fi-nasa-is-funding-these-mind-blowing-projects/"
                      >NASA's Innovative Advanced Concepts program</a
                    >
                    has given Davoyan's group $175,000 to show that the
                    technology is feasible. "There's rich physics in there,"
                    says Davoyan, a mechanical and aerospace engineer at UCLA.
                    To create propulsion, he continues, "you either throw the
                    fuel out of the rocket or you throw the fuel <em>at</em> the
                    rocket." From a physics perspective, they work the same:
                    Both impart momentum to a moving object.

                    Globalization is over, at least for the chip industry, and
                    this will mean higher chip prices, according to
                    semiconductor contract manufacturer giant TSMC. Despite
                    this, the company's founder said he supports US actions to
                    slow the development of China's chip technology.

                    The Taiwanese chip company is caught up in the ongoing
                    semiconductor battle between the superpowers, where the US
                    is trying to prevent China from getting access to cutting
                    edge technology that might be used by its burgeoning
                    military. At least, that is the reason given.

                    At an event hosted by Taiwan's CommonWealth Magazine in
                    Taipei, retired TSMC founder Morris Chang said that efforts
                    to contain China were leading to a split in the global
                    supply chain that would likely increase prices and could
                    have an effect on chip availability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There's no question in my mind that, in the chip sector,
                    globalization is dead. Free trade is not quite that dead,
                    but it's in danger," Chang said.

                    [...] It has already been noted that US efforts to isolate

                    supply chain infrastructure that has built up over the past
                    few decades.

                    Giant frickin' laser beams get all the buzz and sci-fi love,
                    but it's our little laser bros that are putting in the work:

                    case of a Sony camera, helping people with vision problems
                    see clearly through an electronic viewfinder and take

                    projecting the camera's focused live view image into the
                    user's eye. The low-power laser projection is designed to
                    effectively bypass the focusing of the eye, helping users
                    with visual impairments like shortsightedness,
                    farsightedness, or astigmatism see a clear image.

                    It uses Sony's existing DSC-HX99 compact camera, which is a
                    somewhat middling model from 2018 with an 18-megapixel
                    sensor and equivalent zoom lens of 24-720mm (30x
                    magnification), combined with QD Laser's Retissa Neoviewer
                    projector. According to
                    <a
                      href="https://retissa.biz/en/retissa-neoviewer#:~:text=discover%20your%20life.-,RETISSA%20NEOVIEWER,-Name"
                      >QD Laser's specs</a
                    >, the Retissa Neoviewer uses an RGB semiconductor laser to
                    display an image with an equivalent of 720p resolution and
                    8-bit color depth. This beamed image has an approximate
                    60-degree horizontal field of view with 60Hz refresh, and
                    the housing's battery has an estimated four hours of battery
                    life. Tragically, it charges via Micro USB instead of USB-C.

                    Remember Second Life? The virtual world launched on the
                    desktop web back in 2003 with 3D avatars and spaces for
                    various social activities. Believe it or not, it has been
                    running continually this entire time—and now it's coming to
                    mobile for the first time.

                    In fact, this will be the first time that Second Life has
                    expanded beyond the PC (across Windows, macOS, and Linux) in
                    any form.

                    [...] Another interesting thing going on here is how people
                    expect that the robots want to be "fed" trash and recycling:

                      <p>
                        Occasionally, people thought the robots expected trash
                        from them and felt obligated to give the robots
                        something. As the robot passed and stopped by the same
                        person for the second time, she said: "I guess it knows
                        I've been sitting here long enough, I should give it
                        something." Some people would even find an excuse to
                        generate trash to "satisfy" and dismiss the trash barrel
                        by searching through a bag or picking rubbish up off the
                        floor.

                    [...] I wonder how much of this social interaction is
                    dependent on the novelty of meeting the trash barrel robots
                    for the first time, and whether (if these robots were to
                    become full-time staff) humans would start treating them
                    more like janitors. I'm also not sure how well these robots
                    would do if they were autonomous. If part of the magic comes
                    from having a human in the loop to manage what seems like
                    (but probably aren't) relatively simple human-robot
                    interactions, turning that into effective autonomy could be
                    a real challenge.

                    Yet in countless ways, scientists have done just that. In
                    some cases, the reasons for this have been well-meaning
                    ones, as with the priority to diversify the populations
                    involved in medical studies. In other cases, scientists have
                    carelessly allowed social views of race to influence
                    research that could otherwise have had a solid empirical
                    foundation. Finally, true believers in racial essentialism
                    have always twisted scientific results to support their
                    views.

                    The NIH, as the largest funder of biomedical research on the
                    planet, has been forced to navigate our growing
                    understanding of genetics while trying to diversify both the
                    researchers it funds and the participants who volunteer to
                    be part of these studies. NIH thus commissioned the National
                    Academies to generate this report, presumably in the hope it
                    would provide evidence-based guidelines on how to manage the
                    sometimes competing pressures.

                  <p>
                    The resulting report makes clear why racial thinking needs
                    to go. A summary of the mismatch between <em>race</em> and
                    <em>science</em> offers welcome clarity on the problem:

                      <p>
                        In humans, race is a socially constructed designation, a
                        misleading and harmful surrogate for population genetic
                        differences, and has a long history of being incorrectly
                        identified as the major genetic reason for phenotypic
                        differences between groups. Rather, human genetic
                        variation is the result of many forces—historical,
                        social, biological—and no single variable fully
                        represents this complexity. The structure of genetic
                        variation results from repeated human population mixing
                        and movements across time, yet the misconception that
                        human beings can be naturally divided into biologically
                        distinguishable races has been extremely resilient and
                        has become embedded in scientific research, medical
                        practice and technologies, and formal education.

                    The results of racial thinking are problematic in a variety
                    of ways. Historically, we've treated race as conveying some
                    essential properties, and thinking of populations in terms
                    of race tends to evoke that essentialist perspective—even
                    though it's clear that any population has a complicated
                    mixture of genetic, social, and environmental exposures.
                    Essentialist thinking also tends to undermine recognition of
                    the important role played by those environmental and social
                    factors in shaping the population.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The report also notes that science's racial baggage leads to
                    sloppy thinking. Scientists will often write in broad racial
                    terms when they're working with far more specific
                    populations, and they'll mention racial groups even when
                    it's not clear that the information is even relevant to
                    their results. These tendencies have grown increasingly
                    untenable as we've gotten far better at directly measuring
                    the things that race was meant to be a proxy for, such as
                    genetic distance between individuals.

                    Even if the White House selects a new nominee in the next
                    few weeks, it could take months for them to be vetted and
                    confirmed by the Senate. If the White House drags its feet
                    in finding a replacement, Biden could be without a fifth
                    commissioner when the 2024 election season begins. "The FCC
                    deadlock, now over two years long, will remain so for a long
                    time," Sohn said in a statement announcing her withdrawal
                    last week. "It is a sad day for our country and our
                    democracy when dominant industries, with assistance from
                    unlimited dark money, get to choose their regulators."

                    favoring or degrading the quality of specific services, was
                    one of Biden's big-ticket promises. But as it's an issue
                    that mostly splits down party lines, the FCC's stalemate has
                    left his hands tied — putting states in charge of issuing
                    their own patchwork rules.

                    His 2021 infrastructure package required the agency to craft
                    rules that would ensure all Americans, despite income
                    status, have equal access to the internet. The agency has
                    until November to draft these new digital discrimination
                    rules, but civil rights groups fear it may be impossible to

                    Without clocks or modern tools, ancient Mexicans watched the
                    sun to maintain a farming calendar that precisely tracked
                    seasons and even adjusted for leap years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before the Spanish arrival in 1519, the Basin of Mexico's
                    agricultural system fed a population that was
                    extraordinarily large for the time. Whereas Seville, the
                    largest urban center in Spain, had a population of fewer
                    than 50,000, the Basin, now known as Mexico City, was home
                    to as many as 3 million people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To feed so many people in a region with a dry spring and
                    summer monsoons required advanced understanding of when
                    seasonal variations in weather would arrive. Planting too
                    early, or too late, could have proved disastrous. The
                    failure of any calendar to adjust for leap-year fluctuations
                    could also have led to crop failure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Though colonial chroniclers documented the use of a
                    calendar, it was not previously understood how the Mexica,
                    or Aztecs, were able to achieve such accuracy. New UC
                    Riverside research, published in the Proceedings of the
                    National Academy of Sciences, demonstrates how they did it.
                    They used the mountains of the Basin as a solar observatory,
                    keeping track of the sunrise against the peaks of the Sierra
                    Nevada mountains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We concluded they must have stood at a single spot, looking
                    eastwards from one day to another, to tell the time of year
                    by watching the rising sun," said Exequiel Ezcurra,
                    distinguished UCR professor of ecology who led the research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To find that spot, the researchers studied Mexica
                    manuscripts. These ancient texts referred to Mount Tlaloc,
                    which lies east of the Basin. The research team explored the
                    high mountains around the Basin and a temple at the
                    mountain's summit. Using astronomical computer models, they
                    confirmed that a long causeway structure at the temple
                    aligns with the rising sun on Feb. 24, the first day of the
                    Aztec new year.

                    Shares of Baidu fell as much as 10 percent on Thursday after
                    the web search company showed only a pre-recorded video of
                    its AI chatbot Ernie in the first public release of China's
                    answer to ChatGPT.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Beijing-based tech company has claimed Ernie will remake
                    its business and for weeks talked up plans to incorporate
                    generative artificial intelligence into its search engine
                    and other products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But on Thursday, millions of people tuning in to the event
                    were left with little idea of whether Baidu's chatbot could
                    compete with ChatGPT.<br />[...]<br />"We can only explore
                    by ourselves. Training ChatGPT took OpenAI more than a year,
                    and it took them another year to tune GPT-4," said one Baidu
                    employee. "It means we're two years behind."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

                    The leading explanation for the origin of the moon proposes

                    (<em>SN: 5/2/22; SN: 6/5/19; SN: 1/2/18</em>). Yuan and his
                    colleagues chose to focus on two continent-sized blobs of
                    material in Earth's lower mantle known as

                    >
                    (<em>SN: 5/12/16</em>). These are regions through which
                    seismic waves are known to move anomalously slow.
                    Researchers had previously proposed these regions could have
                    formed from old, subducted plates<em>.</em> But in 2021,
                    Yuan and colleagues alternatively proposed that the
                    mysterious masses could be the dense, sunken

                    [...] While the simulations suggest the large low-shear
                    velocity provinces could have had a hand in starting
                    subduction, it's not yet clear whether these masses came
                    from Theia. "The features ... are a fairly recent
                    discovery," says geodynamicist Laurent Montési of the
                    University of Maryland in College Park. "They're very
                    fascinating structures, with a very unknown origin." As
                    such, he says, it's too early to say that Theia triggered
                    plate tectonics.

                  <p>
                    "It's provoking. This material down there is something
                    special," Montési says of the large low-shear velocity
                    provinces. "But whether it has to be originally
                    extraterrestrial, I don't think the case is made."

                    A data center about the size of a washing machine is being
                    used to heat a public swimming pool in England.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Data centers' servers generate heat as they operate, and
                    interest is growing in finding ways to harness it to cut
                    energy costs and offset carbon emissions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this latest example, the computing technology has been
                    placed inside a white box and surrounded by oil, which
                    captures the heat before being pumped into a heat exchanger,
                    according to a
                    <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64939558"
                      >BBC report</a
                    >.

                  <p>
                    The setup is effective enough to heat a council-run swimming
                    pool in Exmouth, about 150 miles west of London, to about 86
                    degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) for about 60% of the
                    time, saving the operator thousands of dollars. And with
                    energy costs rising sharply in the U.K., and councils
                    looking for ways to save money, an initiative like this
                    could be the difference between the pool staying open and
                    closing down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Behind the idea is U.K.-based tech startup Deep Green. In
                    exchange for hosting its kit, Deep Green installs free
                    digital boilers at pools and pays for the energy that they
                    use. Meanwhile, tech firms pay Deep Green to use its
                    computing power for various artificial intelligence and
                    machine learning projects.

                    Qualcomm on Monday began an attempt to convince the European
                    Union's Court of Justice that it should not pay a €242
                    million ($258 million) fine imposed on it for
                    anti-competitive behavior.

                    The fine — worth about two percent of Qualcomm's 2022
                    profits — was

                    against the US chipmaker in 2019. At the time, the European
                    Commission found that Qualcomm had sold 3G baseband chipsets
                    at a loss to harm British rival Icera's ability to compete.

                    [...] In order to prevent Nvidia-controlled Icera from
                    claiming a larger slice of the market, the European
                    Commission says Qualcomm began selling its UMTS chipsets to
                    the likes of Huawei and ZTE at prices its rival couldn't
                    match.

                  <p>
                    [...] The European Commission ultimately smacked Qualcomm
                    with a €242 million fine for its behavior. As Qualcomm's
                    profits reached $12.9 billion last year, the fine is
                    significant but not very damaging.

                  <p>
                    Qualcomm is nevertheless trying to avoid paying the fine. In

                    that Qualcomm Attorney, Miguel Rato claimed the European
                    Commission was on a "crusade" against the company. Rato also
                    called into question the basis for the Commission's
                    argument, arguing the specific market for 3G baseband chips
                    accounted for less than a percent of the overall UMTS market
                    at the time.

                    for anticompetitive behavior over the past few years, the

                    WR 124 was actually one of the first observations made by
                    JWST in June 2022, the space agency said, but the image has
                    been unveiled just now. The Wolf-Rayet phase is a brief
                    condition some stars go through during their lifetime before
                    turning into supernovae, which makes Webb's observations a
                    valuable asset to astronomers studying the life of stars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    WR 124 is 30 times the mass of our Sun, NASA said, and it
                    has "shed" 10 Suns' worth of material so far. The ejected
                    gas moves away from the central body and cools down, forming
                    cosmic dust and glowing in the infrared light that is
                    detectable by Webb's advanced instruments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Before Webb, astronomers investigating cosmic dust
                    simply had no way to capture detailed images and information
                    about a dust-rich environment like the WR 124 nebula. And
                    dust, NASA said, plays an essential role in the inner
                    working of the universe as it shelters forming stars, and
                    gathers together to help shape planets, molecules and even
                    the building blocks of life on Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dust is a fundamental element for our universe, and yet
                    scientists still have to explain why the universe seemingly
                    contains more dust than our current dust-formation theories
                    can justify. The universe is "operating with a dust budget
                    surplus," NASA remarked.

                    [...] In the new study, Deisseroth and his colleagues used a
                    light attached to a tiny vest over a mouse's genetically
                    engineered heart to change the animal's heart rate. When the
                    light was off, a mouse's heart pumped at about 600 beats per
                    minute. But when the team turned on a light that flashed at
                    900 beats per minutes, the mouse's heartbeat followed suit.
                    "It's a nice reasonable acceleration, [one a mouse] would
                    encounter in a time of stress or fear," Deisseroth explains.

                    When the mice felt their hearts racing, they showed
                    anxiety-like behavior. In risky scenarios — like open areas
                    where a little mouse might be someone's lunch — the rodents
                    slunk along the walls and lurked in darker corners. When
                    pressing a lever for water that could sometimes be coupled
                    with a mild shock, mice with normal heart rates still
                    pressed without hesitation. But mice with racing hearts
                    decided they'd rather go thirsty.

                    eventually factor into how doctors treat panic and anxiety,
                    Beyeler says. But the path between the lab and the clinic,
                    she notes, is much more convoluted than that of the heart to
                    the head.

                    It's not clear when lawmakers might get around to moving on
                    the issue, if ever, although Biden could issue an executive
                    order for parts of it.

                    [...] So, what does all this have to do with Microsoft?
                    Plenty. The feds have made clear they believe Microsoft has
                    a long way to go before it meets basic cybersecurity
                    recommendations. At least one top government security
                    official has already publicly called out Microsoft for poor
                    security practices.
                  </p>

                    enterprise customers use multifactor authentication, a
                    number she called "disappointing." That might not sound like
                    much of a condemnation, but remember, this is the federal
                    government we're talking about. It parses its words very
                    carefully. "Disappointing" to them is the equivalent of
                    "terrible job" anywhere else.

                    [...] Even without laws and executive orders, the company
                    could be in trouble. The US government spends billions of
                    dollars on Microsoft systems and services every year, a
                    revenue stream that could be endangered if Microsoft doesn't
                    adhere to the standards.

                    A second set of related chemicals (PFNA, PFHXs, PFBS, and
                    GenX Chemicals) will be regulated as a collective. Each will
                    have limits set on the levels allowable. The levels of each
                    will be calculated as a percentage of that limit, and the
                    percentages totalled; if they exceed 100 percent, then the
                    regulations will kick in.

                    As part of its earlier efforts, the EPA has already been

                    these chemicals. It also says that a variety of means of
                    extracting these chemicals from water are now available.

                    Of the skeletal remains of more than 2300 early farmers from
                    180 sites dating from around 8000 – 4000 years ago to, more
                    than one in ten displayed weapon injuries, bioarchaeologists
                    found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Contrary to the view that the Neolithic era was marked by
                    peaceful cooperation, the team of international researchers
                    say that in some regions the period from 6000BC to 2000BC
                    may be a high point in conflict and violence with the
                    destruction of entire communities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings also suggest the rise of growing crops and
                    herding animals as a way of life, replacing hunting and
                    gathering, may have laid the foundations for formalised
                    warfare.

                  <p>
                    [...] More than ten per cent showed damage potentially
                    caused by frequent blows to the head by blunt instruments or
                    stone axes. Several examples of penetrative injuries,
                    thought to be from arrows, were also found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some of the injuries were linked to mass burials, which
                    could suggest the destruction of entire communities, the
                    researchers say.

                    [...] The Department of Transportation is now accepting
                    applications for its $2.5 billion Charging and Fueling
                    Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program, which will hand
                    out funds to cities, counties, regional governments and
                    tribes to help deploy EV chargers, hydrogen fuel stations
                    and other reduced-emissions systems near their residents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Half of the program's funding will go to chargers and
                    stations in "publicly accessible" places like parking
                    facilities, parks and schools. The rest will install this
                    equipment in "alternative fuel corridors" along highways to
                    help with long-distance travel. The initial round of funding
                    will make $700 million available, with the rest coming over
                    the program's five-year span. Officials have to apply no
                    later than May 30th.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The initiative is part of [a] broader campaign to build
                    500,000 charging stations by 2030, or about five times as
                    many as there were in early 2022. The money, assigned as
                    part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is meant to
                    ensure charging access within 50 miles of someone's location
                    in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
                    While the effort is intended to spur overall EV adoption,
                    there's an added focus on underserved communities like some
                    urban and rural areas.

                  <p>
                    A strong charging infrastructure is widely considered vital
                    to successfully transitioning away from combustion engine
                    cars. Existing stations can

                    currently being stowed away by the Perseverance Rover on the

                    as 2030, an increase from $800 million originally assigned

                    They're not alone. The CEOs of Endeavor, Buzzfeed,
                    Microsoft, Spotify, Youtube, Snap, Sports Illustrated, and
                    CAA are all out there, pumping up the AI bubble with every
                    hour that god sends, declaring that the future is AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Google and Bing are locked in an arms-race to see
                    whose search engine can attain the speediest, most profound
                    enshittification via chatbot, replacing links to web-pages
                    with florid paragraphs composed by fully automated,
                    supremely confident liars:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Blockchain was a solution in search of a problem. So is AI.
                    Yes, Buzzfeed will be able to reduce its wage-bill by
                    automating its personality quiz vertical, and Spotify's "AI
                    DJ" will produce slightly less terrible playlists (at least,
                    to the extent that Spotify doesn't put its thumb on the
                    scales by inserting tracks into the playlists whose only
                    fitness factor is that someone paid to boost them).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But even if you add all of this up, double it, square it,
                    and add a billion dollar confidence interval, it still
                    doesn't add up to what Bank Of America analysts called "a
                    defining moment — like the internet in the '90s." For one
                    thing, the most exciting part of the "internet in the '90s"
                    was that it had incredibly low barriers to entry and wasn't
                    dominated by large companies – indeed, it had them running
                    scared.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The AI bubble, by contrast, is being inflated by massive
                    incumbents, whose excitement boils down to "This will let
                    the biggest companies get much, much bigger and the rest of
                    you can go fuck yourselves." Some revolution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AI has all the hallmarks of a classic pump-and-dump,
                    starting with terminology. AI isn't "artificial" and it's
                    not "intelligent." "Machine learning" doesn't learn. On this
                    week's Trashfuture podcast, they made an excellent (and
                    profane and hilarious) case that ChatGPT is best understood
                    as a sophisticated form of autocomplete – not our new robot
                    overlord.

                  <p>
                    On Monday, a three-judge panel at the appeals court ruled
                    that workers could be treated as independent contractors.
                    However it removed a clause, which put restrictions on
                    collective bargaining by workers, from Proposition 22.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shares in Uber and Lyft were almost 5% higher in after-hours
                    trading.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Today's ruling is a victory for app-based workers and
                    millions of Californians who voted for Prop 22," Tony West,
                    chief legal officer at Uber said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Tens of millions of people work in the global gig
                    economy across services like food delivery and transport.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gig workers are paid for individual tasks, such as a food
                    delivery or a car journey, rather than getting a regular
                    wage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most US federal and state labour laws, such as those
                    requiring a minimum wage or overtime pay, do not apply to
                    gig workers.

                    In some places, you can find extreme examples of how people
                    have been affected. Take the village of Coucouron in the
                    south of the country, where a truck <a

                    up to 10 times a day since July—without any hiatus during
                    the supposedly wetter months.

                    In the UK, also, many rivers are <a

                    the Alps and flows through multiple countries toward the
                    North Sea. It fell considerably last year, <a

                    for this time of year, according to some estimates. Lucie
                    Fahrner, a spokeswoman for the Central Commission for the
                    Navigation of the Rhine, denies that the river level is low
                    at present, despite its lower-than-average levels, adding
                    that various measures to help shipping cope with drought in
                    the future are currently being evaluated.

                    What happens during the next few months will really matter.
                    Abundant rainfall could ease the situation and stave off the
                    worst-case scenario. But Europe needs a lot. "We're talking
                    about a sea, a sea's worth of water," says Hannah Cloke at
                    the University of Reading in the UK. In terms of volume,
                    hundreds of millions of cubic liters of rain would have to
                    fall across the continent to fill the deficit, she
                    estimates. It would have to amount to higher-than-average
                    rainfall for France and certain other places, including
                    parts of the UK. The chances of that are, unfortunately, not
                    high.

                    [...] I suspect that many of these entrepreneurs will reach
                    a valuation of many millions of dollars (depending on the
                    type of cloud tech business) after a couple of years and
                    average growth. I've seen this personally a great many
                    times. Beats most 401(k)s.

                    This will have an overall positive effect on the technology
                    industry and cloud computing specifically, given that these
                    types of businesses drive more innovation. They are not
                    hindered by large corporate governance and company politics.
                    Creativity and innovation are directly rewarded with sales
                    and higher business value. This will also increase the
                    number of wealthy people in the technology industry since
                    this model will better disburse wealth among more technology

                    TikTok has a large science community, and the social network
                    wants everyone to know it on Pi Day (March 14). The company
                    is launching a dedicated STEM (science, technology,
                    engineering and math) feed that shows only these more
                    educational videos. You may learn to code or discuss
                    experiments without having to wade through TikTok's usual
                    entertainment-focused content.

                    study content to make sure it's relevant to the STEM feed,
                    while the fact-checkers at Poynter will gauge the accuracy.

                    Users in the US will start seeing the STEM feed in the
                    "coming weeks," TikTok says. The social media giant has
                    already been experimenting with a "Topic Feed" in some
                    regions to court fans of gaming, sports and other common
                    subjects. The science-oriented feed is considered an
                    expansion of this initiative.

                    HRL Laboratories, LLC, has published the first demonstration
                    of universal control of encoded spin qubits. This newly
                    emerging approach to quantum computation uses a novel
                    silicon-based qubit device architecture, fabricated in HRL's
                    Malibu cleanroom, to trap single electrons in quantum dots.
                    Spins of three such single electrons host energy-degenerate
                    qubit states, which are controlled by nearest-neighbor
                    contact interactions that partially swap spin states with
                    those of their neighbors.

                    [...] The encoded silicon/silicon germanium quantum dot
                    qubits use three electron spins and a control scheme whereby
                    voltages applied to metal gates partially swap the
                    directions of those electron-spins without ever aligning
                    them in any particular direction. The demonstration involved
                    applying thousands of these precisely calibrated voltage
                    pulses in strict relation to one another over the course of
                    a few millionths of a second.

                    of partial swap operations, and the configurable
                    insensitivity of the encoding to certain error sources
                    combine to offer a strong pathway toward scalable fault
                    tolerance and computational advantage, major steps toward a

                  <p>
                    Now, scientists have created just such a map for the most
                    advanced creature yet: a fruit fly larva. Called a
                    connectome, it diagrams the insect's 3016 neurons and
                    548,000 synapses,

                    >
                    has reported. The map will help researchers study better
                    understand how the brains of both insects and animals
                    control behavior, learning, body functions and more. The
                    work may even inspired improved AI networks.

                    annelid, all of which have several hundred neurons," said
                    professor Marta Zlatic from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular
                    Biology. "This means neuroscience has been mostly operating
                    without circuit maps. Without knowing the structure of a
                    brain, we're guessing on the way computations are
                    implemented. But now, we can start gaining a mechanistic
                    understanding of how the brain works."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As a next step, the team will investigate the
                    structures used for behavioural functions like learning and
                    decision making, and examine connectome activity while the
                    insect does specific activities. And while a fruit fly larva
                    is a simple insect, the researchers expect to see similar
                    patterns in other animals. "In the same way that genes are
                    conserved across the animal kingdom, I think that the basic
                    circuit motifs that implement these fundamental behaviours
                    will also be conserved," said Zlatic.
