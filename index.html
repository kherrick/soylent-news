              <p>
                From the "everything is ruined by advertising" comes this gem:

                <a href="https://www.vodxs.com/">https://www.vodxs.com/</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                Now some fool's decided to mount advertising screens to the tops
                of washroom faucets, because, well, I guess you got nothing
                better to do while washing your hands than look at a stupid ad
                at the same time.
              </p>
              <p>
                How long do you think these will last in the real world before
                the users break the screens so they no longer have to look at
                the stupid ads?
              </p>
              <p>
                I cannot imagine these lasting long in many public places.
                Perhaps in an office building or somewhere similar but elsewhere
                I would imagine their life will be measured in days. They will
                have to be powered so now each faucet will have to be wired up -
                never a good idea where water is involved. So what is the
                financial incentive for the place where they will be installed.
                Will somebody else will be getting free advertising from
                something that the installer has had to pay for? Who pays for
                their running costs? Does the manufacturer pay for the
                installation and upkeep? If so, how do they see this making them
                money?
              </p>

                    IBM is in the process of shutting down its research and
                    development (R&amp;D) departments in China, local media
                    outlets say, becoming the latest American tech giant to
                    scale back its presence in the increasingly restrictive
                    China-based market.

                    The decision by the Armonk, New York-based tech service
                    provider will affect its more than 1,000 employees across
                    China, local staff told multiple Chinese media outlets,

                    to invest in the Chinese market in the 1980s, according to

                    The dramatic drop in Antarctic sea ice over the last couple
                    of years makes these rafting connections particularly
                    concerning.

                    "Sea ice is very abrasive and so acts as a barrier for many
                    non-native species to successfully establish around
                    Antarctica," Dr. Dawson says.

                  <p>
                    "If the recent decline in Antarctic sea ice continues, then
                    living things floating at the surface, or attached to
                    floating objects, could have an easier time colonizing the
                    continent, which may have big impacts on ecosystems."

                    What you would do with a hulking mainframe system like this
                    in 2024 is harder to fathom. We mentioned that the IBM 7070
                    up for auction was used in some weapons research role. They
                    were also positioned as useful for research fields spanning
                    aerospace engineering, weather forecasting, and nuclear
                    sciences.

                    However, in 2024, the smartphone in your pocket or a humble
                    Raspberry Pi will comprehensively outgun this type of
                    machine in terms of processing power. Thus, it is probably
                    destined to be bought up by a museum, educational
                    institution, or exhibition space. It might also be a good
                    purchase for TV/Movie studios for some historical or
                    retro-science scenes.

                    The Dutch data protection authority (DPA) has hit Uber with
                    a €290mn fine for transferring personal European driver data
                    to the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the DPA, the transfers constituted a "serious
                    violation" of the EU's
                    <a
                      href="https://next.thenextweb.com/news/gdpr-turns-five-half-the-fines-have-gone-to-meta-facebook"
                      >GDPR</a
                    >, as they failed to provide the necessary safeguards for
                    data storage outside the block.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Following an investigation, the DPA found that, between
                    August 2021 and November 2023, Uber was transferring and
                    storing sensitive data to US servers without the additional
                    protection tools required by the GDPR.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The data included taxi licences, account and payment
                    details, IDs, photos, and even criminal or medical records.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The investigation was prompted by a complaint from
                    over 170 French drivers to local human rights organisation
                    Ligue des droits de l'Homme (LDH). LDH then filed a
                    complaint to France's data protection watchdog CNIL.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the GDPR, companies processing data across the
                    EU must answer to a single privacy authority, located in the
                    country where a business has its European headquarters. As
                    Uber's base is in the Netherlands, the DPA led the probe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The DPA said that Uber has now stopped the practice. It's
                    also going to appeal the decision.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is the third fine the Dutch watchdog imposes on Uber.
                    In 2018, the DPA hit the company with

                    for failing to notify the agency on time over a data breach
                    in 2016. And as of January this year, Uber is also facing a

                    on August 22 that the company was able to integrate Amazon
                    Q, its generative AI assistant, into its internal systems to
                    update its foundational software.
                  </p>
                  <p>The result has been a "game changer," Jassy said.</p>
                  <p>
                    "The average time to upgrade an application to Java 17
                    plummeted from what's typically 50 developer-days to just a
                    few hours," he wrote. "We estimate this has saved us the
                    equivalent of 4500 developer-years of work (yes, that number
                    is crazy but, real)."

                    The AI is not only fast but seems pretty accurate, too,
                    according to his post. Amazon developers shipped 79% of the
                    AI-generated code reviews without any additional changes,

                    describing the microbial portion of the Michigan Tech
                    project, and said that the group’s plans are feasible. But
                    he pointed out a significant challenge: At the moment, only
                    certain microorganisms are considered safe to eat, namely
                    “those we have been eating thorough fermented food and
                    beverages, such as lactic acid bacteria, bacillus, some
                    yeasts.” But these don’t degrade plastics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before using the plastic-eating microbes as food for humans,
                    the research team will submit evidence to regulators
                    indicating that the substance is safe. Joshua Pearce, an
                    electrical engineer at Western University in Ontario,
                    Canada, performed the initial toxicology screening, breaking
                    the microbes down into smaller pieces, which they compared
                    against known toxins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Even if the plastic-eating microbes turn out to be
                    safe for human consumption, Techtmann said, the public might
                    still balk at the prospect of eating something nourished on
                    plastic waste. For this reason, he said, this particular
                    group of microbes might prove most useful on remote military
                    bases or during disaster relief, where it could be consumed
                    short-term, to help people survive.

                    product after about only six months and then bricking the
                    device's exclusive feature only a year after release. The
                    short-lived Echo Show 8 Photos Edition and PhotosPlus

                    While NASA and Boeing maintain that Starliner is ready to

                    For one, Starliner's spacesuits aren't compatible with those

                    precaution inside spacecraft in case of cabin pressure loss,
                    they could still prove life-saving if an emergency were to
                    occur. They can also help with temperature regulation, and
                    in some cases collect data and pass it on to the

                    The spinal cord plays a critical role in controlling
                    movement and other vital functions, and the ability to
                    record spinal neurons with fine-grained spatial and temporal
                    resolution during unrestrained motion offers a window into
                    the mechanisms that make this possible. Using spinalNET,
                    researchers discovered that the spinal neurons in the
                    central pattern generator — the neuronal circuit that can
                    produce rhythmic motor patterns such as walking in the
                    absence of specific timing information — seem to be involved
                    with a lot more than rhythmic movement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Some of them are strongly correlated with leg movement, but
                    surprisingly, a lot of neurons have no obvious correlation
                    with movement,” Wu said. “This indicates that the spinal
                    circuit controlling rhythmic movement is more complicated
                    than we thought.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers said they hope to help unravel some of this
                    complexity in future research, tackling questions such as
                    the difference between how spinal neurons process reflex
                    motion ⎯ getting startled, for instance ⎯ versus volitional
                    action.

                    and is likely down between 75 and 85% from when Elon took
                    over. And now the Wall Street Journal has a piece
                    recognizing that the banks that financed about $13 billion
                    of the $44 billion Musk needed are admitting that it

                  <p>
                    The headline of the article actually underplays the story,
                    calling it “the worst buyout for banks since the financial
                    crisis.” But that’s just based on the “hang” — the length of
                    time the deal has remained on their books. You see, the way
                    this <em>normally</em> works is that the big banks lend the
                    money and then almost immediately turn around and sell off
                    the debt to other suckers to deal with.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, in the case of Musk and Twitter, the banks immediately
                    rubber-stamped it on the basis of “Ooooh, that Elon, doesn’t
                    he always make money?” and without doing much (if any) due
                    diligence. The entities who would buy the debt actually care
                    about the return (or lack thereof) and were quick to
                    recognize that Musk was going to tank Twitter’s revenue
                    potential.

                  <p>
                    Some of this was known before. Just as Musk was about to
                    officially gain control of Twitter, it was reported that the
                    banks were regretting their decision as they realized they

                  <p>
                    To make matters worse for all involved, it has been reported
                    that the banks agreed to a
                    <a
                      href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/06/elon-musk-twitter-x-financing-wall-street-banks/"

                    >, preventing any bank from taking a deal that isn’t offered
                    to the rest of them. But to make matters even worse for Elon
                    specifically, he apparently
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/elon-musk-told-bankers-they-wouldnt-lose-any-money-on-twitter-purchase/"
                      >promised the bankers they wouldn’t lose money</a
                    >
                    on this deal. It’s unclear how binding that promise is, and
                    Musk is somewhat infamous for breaking promises. But it
                    certainly could impact his ability to borrow in the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That said, the WSJ article highlights that the banks have
                    had to hang on to the (greatly devalued) loans for a record
                    length of time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Maybe the banks will think about due diligence next time? I
                    mean, it was no secret that the basic ideas Musk laid out
                    for how he was going to run Twitter were absolute nonsense
                    from Day One.

                    But, while the headline and the beginning of the piece
                    compare the performance of this deal to the financial
                    crisis, they admit deeper in the article that it may just be
                    one of the worst of all time...[.]

                    Durov, 39, was said to have been arrested at 8pm French
                    time, having flown in from Azerbaijan. The warrant on Durov
                    was only valid if he was on French soil. As a result, TF1
                    reported that Durov traveled via the UAE, former Soviet
                    countries and South America to avoid arrest in Europe. He
                    also reportedly avoided traveling through countries where
                    Telegram is under surveillance.

                    flight just a stopover? In any case, he's in custody."

                    refused to comply with a court order to grant state security

                    Locking up merchandise at drugstores and discount retailers
                    hasn't curbed retail theft but is driving frustrated
                    consumers to shop online more, retail experts tell Axios.
                    Retail crime is eating into retailers' profits and high
                    theft rates are also leading to a rise in store closures.
                    Secured cases can cause sales to drop 15% to 25%, Joe
                    Budano, CEO of anti-theft technology company Indyme,
                    previously told Axios. Barricading everything from razors to
                    laundry detergent has largely backfired and broken shopping

                    Aisles full of locked plexiglass cases are common at many
                    CVS and Walgreens stores where consumers have to wait for an
                    employee to unlock them. Target, Walmart, Dollar General and
                    other retailers have also pulled back on self-checkout to
                    deter shoplifting. "Locking up products worsens the shopping
                    experience, and it makes things inconvenient and difficult,"
                    GlobalData retail analyst Neil Saunders said, adding it
                    pushes shoppers to other retailers or to move purchases
                    online.

                    Driving the news: Manmohan Mahajan, Walgreens global chief
                    financial officer, said in a June earnings call that the
                    retailer was experiencing "higher levels of shrink." Amazon
                    CEO Andy Jassy spoke of the "speed and ease" of ordering
                    online versus walking into pharmacies on a call with
                    investors last week. "It's a pretty tough experience with
                    how much is locked behind cabinets, where you have to press
                    a button to get somebody to come out and open the cabinets
                    for you," Jassy said.

                    The historical review and experiment may help solve a puzzle
                    that has fueled decades of debate in archaeology circles:
                    How did communities in North America actually use Clovis
                    points, which are among the most frequently unearthed items
                    from the Ice Age?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Clovis points are often the only recovered part of a
                    spear. The intricately designed bone shafts at the end of
                    the weapon are sometimes found, but the wood at the base of
                    the spear and the pine pitch and lacing that help make them
                    function as a complete system have been lost to time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Plus, research silos limit that kind of systems thinking
                    about prehistoric weaponry, Jun said. And if stone
                    specialists aren't experts in bone, they might not see the
                    full picture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "You have to look beyond the simple artifact," he said. "One
                    of the things that's key here is that we're looking at this
                    as an engineered system that requires multiple kinds of
                    sub-specialties within our field and other fields."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "People who are doing metal military artifact analysis
                    know all about it because it was used for stopping horses in
                    warfare," Byram said. "But prior to that, and in other
                    contexts with boar hunting or bear hunting, it wasn't very
                    well known. It's a theme that comes back in literature quite
                    a bit. But for whatever reason, it hasn't been talked about
                    too much in anthropology."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Sometimes in archaeology, the pieces just start
                    fitting together like they seem to now with Clovis
                    technology, and this puts pike hunting front and center with
                    extinct megafauna," Byram said. "It opens up a whole new way
                    of looking at how people lived among these incredible
                    animals during much of human history."

                    Although Boeing did not make an official statement Saturday
                    on its long-term plans for Starliner, NASA Administrator
                    Bill Nelson told reporters he received assurances from
                    Boeing's new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, that the company remains
                    committed to the commercial crew program. And it will take a
                    significant commitment from Boeing to see it through. Under
                    the terms of its fixed price contract with NASA, the company
                    is on the hook to pay for any expenses to fix the thruster
                    and helium leak problems and get Starliner flying again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Boeing has already reported $1.6 billion in charges on its
                    financial statements to pay for delays and cost overruns on
                    the Starliner program. That figure will grow as the company
                    will likely need to redesign some elements in the
                    spacecraft's propulsion system to remedy the problems
                    encountered on the Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission. NASA has
                    committed $5.1 billion to Boeing for the Starliner program,
                    and the agency has already paid out most of that funding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Boeing managers had previously declared Starliner was
                    safe enough to bring Wilmore and Williams home. Mark Nappi,
                    Boeing's Starliner program manager, regularly appeared to
                    downplay the seriousness of the thruster issues during press
                    conferences throughout Starliner's nearly three-month
                    mission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So why did NASA and Boeing engineers reach different
                    conclusions? "I think we're looking at the data and we view
                    the data and the uncertainty that's there differently than
                    Boeing does," said Jim Free, NASA's associate administrator,
                    and the agency's most senior civil servant. "It's not a
                    matter of trust. It's our technical expertise and our
                    experience that we have to balance. We balance risk across
                    everything, not just Starliner."

                    Across different cultures and countries, people perceive the
                    wisest people to be logical and reflective as well as able
                    to consider other people's feelings and perceptions.

                    What makes someone seem wise? People view wisdom through the
                    lens of applying knowledge and thinking logically as well as
                    considering others' feelings and perceptions, finds a new
                    study led by University of Waterloo researchers who looked
                    at perceptions of wisdom across 12 countries and five
                    continents.

                    Researchers examined the underlying principles guiding who
                    we perceive as wise in political leadership, science, and
                    daily life. Across different cultures, participants'
                    judgements converged on two dimensions: reflective
                    orientation and socio-emotional awareness. Reflective
                    orientation includes characteristics such as thinking
                    logically, emotion control and application of knowledge.
                    Socio-emotional awareness includes characteristics like care
                    for other's feelings and attention to social context.

                    "To our surprise, the two dimensions emerged across all
                    cultural regions we studied, and both were associated with
                    explicit attribution of wisdom," said Dr. Maksim Rudnev, a
                    postdoctoral research associate in psychology at Waterloo
                    and lead author.

                    The study suggests how people around the world might judge,
                    support and trust leaders, educators and others in positions
                    of influence. One example is how people view U.S. former
                    president Donald Trump and current president Joe Biden.

                Ben Hawkes over at Isoceles has a review of the
                <a href="https://blog.isosceles.com/openssh-backdoors/"
                  >two OpenSSH Backdoor attempts</a
                >. One, the XZ backdoor, was attempted this year in early 2024.
                The other, in 2002, was a matter of attempting to trojanize some
                distribution files.
              </p>

                <div>
                  <p>
                    Inserting an exploitable bug (a "bugdoor"), one that's
                    subtle enough that developers might not even notice during
                    code review, is probably the winning move. However, it's
                    interesting to note that in both 2002 and 2024 we got a
                    backdoor rather than a bugdoor. That's probably because
                    exploits are hard, and server-side exploits are really hard.
                    Given how much work it is to be in a position to change the
                    source code in the first place, it's not entirely surprising
                    that attackers want to go with a reliable option. The
                    counter-argument is that we may just never get to see any
                    bugdoors because they never get caught (or if they do, they
                    don't get flagged as subterfuge), so we're biased towards
                    the events that we can actually detect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are other similarities. Both the 2002 and 2024 events
                    targeted the build system, for example. This also makes
                    sense, because build systems are a perfect mix of
                    inscrutability and expressiveness. There's really no
                    constraints on what you can do with most build systems. They
                    have to be like this in order to make everything work
                    everywhere that it's supposed to. Making something compile
                    on Linux, MacOS, and Windows simultaneously is no easy feat.
                    Add in support for multiple architectures and legacy
                    versions, and well... you see where I'm going with this. The
                    guiding design principle for build systems has been "just
                    make it work", and so they end up being a complicated mess
                    of directives, rules, variables, and command invocations. As
                    long as they're working correctly, I suspect very few people
                    are paying close attention to the contents of their build
                    scripts, and that includes the developers/maintainers
                    themselves. It's the ideal place to insert the first hook
                    for a backdoor, hiding in plain sight.

                    with California lawmakers to fund local news in the state
                    after previously protesting a proposed law that would have
                    required it to pay media outlets. Under the terms of the
                    deal, Google will commit tens of millions of dollars to a
                    fund supporting local news as well as an AI “accelerator
                    program” in the state.

                  <p>
                    The agreement ends a months-long dispute between lawmakers
                    and Google over the California Journalism Preservation Act,
                    a bill that would have required Google, Meta and other large
                    platforms to pay California publishers in exchange for
                    linking to their websites. Google strongly opposed the
                    measure, which was similar to laws passed in Canada and
                    Australia.

                    The agreement also includes funding for a “National AI
                    Innovation Accelerator.” Details of that program are
                    unclear, but <em>Cal Matters</em>

                    and other organizations, including newsrooms. That aspect of
                    the deal, which is so far unique to Google's agreement in

                    certainly didn't think it was aliens. But he realized that
                    if the signals they were identifying had blazed brighter,
                    even momentarily, they would be very much like the Wow!
                    signal. As for the mechanism that caused such a brightening,
                    Mendez et al. propose that a

                    (a highly magnetic neutron star) passing behind a cloud of
                    atomic hydrogen could have flared up with sufficient energy
                    to produce

                    in the form of a tightly focused beam of microwave
                    radiation—a cosmic maser. (Masers are akin to lasers, except
                    they emit microwave radiation rather than visible
                    radiation.)

                    Proving their working hypothesis will be much more
                    challenging, although there have been rare sightings of such
                    naturally occurring masers from hydrogen molecules in space.
                    But nobody has ever spotted an atomic hydrogen cloud with an
                    associated maser, and that's what would be needed to explain
                    the intensity of the Wow! signal. That's why other
                    astronomers are opting for cautious skepticism. “A magnetar
                    is going to produce [short] radio emissions as well. Do you
                    really need this complicated maser stuff happening as well
                    to explain the Wow! signal?” Michael Garrett of the

                    and closes by saying, “SB 1047 is a highly reasonable bill
                    that asks large AI labs to do what they’ve already committed
                    to doing, namely, test their large models for catastrophic

                    Apple device users recently discovered a minor bug that
                    causes the Settings screen and home screen to crash. While
                    no serious issues have been reported so far, a fix in a
                    future firmware update would not be surprising.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Swiping right on the iOS home screen until the app library
                    appears, and then typing the characters "::" into the search
                    bar, causes Springboard – the software that handles the main
                    menu – to crash. A black screen with a loading icon briefly
                    appears before the device returns to the lock screen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, entering the same characters into the search
                    bar at the top of the Settings menu crashes the app,
                    immediately sending users back to the home screen. However,
                    the bug can be triggered by variations of this character
                    combination as well.
                  </p>

                    that nearly any combination involving two quotation marks,
                    one colon, and any other character can trigger the same
                    effect. For example, typing "X":X also causes the issue.
                    TechSpot confirmed that the bug occurs on iPhones and iPads
                    running firmware version 17.6.1, but Macs remain unaffected.

                    resembles more serious incidents from the past.

                    For example, particles ejected at velocities below 500 m/s
                    could reach Mars in about 13 years, whereas those ejected at
                    velocities exceeding 1.5 km/s (5,400 km/h; 3,355 mph) could
                    reach Earth in as little as seven years. However, their
                    simulations indicated that it will likely be up to 30 years
                    before any of this ejecta is observed on Earth.

                    observing campaigns in the coming decades will have the last

                    will not pose any risk. Their small size and high speed will

                After all eventually you'll be cut from the loop, cause you are
                a cost. Perhaps coders in Germany are just better then the
                coders in America and India?

                That appears more and more to be the fantasy that they want to

                    sort of "general, exploratory rummaging" that the drafters
                    of the Fourth Amendment intended to outlaw. EFF applauds
                    this decision because it is essential that every person
                    feels like they can simply take their cell phone out into
                    the world without the fear that they might end up a criminal
                    suspect because their location data was swept up in
                    open-ended digital dragnet.

                    The new Fifth Circuit case, <em>United States v. Smith</em>,
                    involved an armed robbery and assault of a US Postal Service
                    worker at a post office in Mississippi in 2018. After
                    several months of investigation, police had no identifiable
                    suspects, so they obtained a geofence warrant covering a
                    large geographic area around the post office for the hour
                    surrounding the crime. Google responded to the warrant with
                    information on several devices, ultimately leading police to
                    the two defendants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On appeal, the Fifth Circuit reached several important
                    holdings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, it determined that under the Supreme Court's landmark
                    ruling in <em>Carpenter v. United States</em>, individuals
                    have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the location
                    data implicated by geofence warrants. As a result, the court
                    broke from the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/eff-tells-minnesota-supreme-court-strike-down-geofence-warrant-fourth-circuit"
                      >Fourth Circuit's deeply flawed decision last month</a
                    >
                    in <em>United States v. Chatrie</em>, noting that although
                    geofence warrants can be more "limited temporally" than the
                    data sought in <em>Carpenter</em>, geofence location data is
                    still highly invasive because it can expose sensitive
                    information about a person's associations and allow police
                    to "follow" them into private spaces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, the court found that even though investigators seek
                    warrants for geofence location data, these searches are
                    inherently unconstitutional. As the court noted, geofence
                    warrants require a provider, almost always Google, to search
                    "the entirety" of its reserve of location data "while law
                    enforcement officials have no idea who they are looking for,
                    or whether the search will even turn up a result."
                    Therefore, "the quintessential problem with these warrants
                    is that they <em>never</em> include a specific user to be
                    identified, only a temporal and geographic location where
                    any given user <em>may</em> turn up post-search. That is
                    constitutionally insufficient."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unsurprisingly, however, the court found that in 2018,
                    police could have relied on such a warrant in "good faith,"
                    because geofence technology was novel, and police reached
                    out to other agencies with more experience for guidance.
                    This means that the evidence they obtained will not be
                    suppressed in this case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nevertheless, it is gratifying to see an appeals court
                    recognize the fundamental invasions of privacy created by
                    these warrants and uphold our constitutional tradition
                    prohibiting general searches. Police around the country have
                    increasingly relied on geofence warrants and other reverse
                    warrants, and this opinion should act as a warning against
                    narrow applications of Fourth Amendment precedent in these
                    cases.

                    Facebook, X, YouTube and other social media platforms rely
                    on a 1996 law to insulate themselves from legal liability
                    for user posts. The protection from this law,

                    rein in the power of those social media giants?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That idea is at the heart of a lawsuit filed in May against
                    Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The
                    plaintiff has asked a federal court to declare that a
                    little-used part of Section 230 makes it permissible for him
                    to release his own software that lets users automatically
                    unfollow everyone on Facebook.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit, filed by Ethan Zuckerman, a public policy
                    professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, is the
                    first to use Section 230 against a tech giant in this way,
                    his lawyers said. It is
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/technology/section-230-explainer.html"

                    >
                    legal maneuver that could turn a law that typically protects
                    companies like Meta on its head. And if Mr. Zuckerman
                    succeeds, it could mean more power for consumers to control
                    what they see online.<br />[...]<br />Mr. Zuckerman has
                    focused on a part of Section 230 that spells out protection
                    for blocking objectionable material online. In 2021, after a
                    developer released software to purge users' Facebook feeds
                    of everyone they follow, Facebook threatened to shut it
                    down. But Section 230 says it is possible to restrict access
                    to obscene, excessively violent and other problematic
                    content. The language shields companies from liability if
                    they censor disturbing content, but lawyers now say it could
                    also be used to justify scrubbing any content users don't
                    want to see.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meta said it had asked U.S. District Court for the Northern
                    District of California, where the lawsuit was filed, to
                    dismiss the case because Mr. Zuckerman had not released a
                    software tool to clean up people's Facebook pages. It also
                    argued that Mr. Zuckerman had not shown that Section 230
                    should apply in his case.

                    AP reported yesterday that "Disney drops bid to have
                    allergy-death lawsuit tossed because plaintiff signed up for
                    Disney+."
                  </p>

                    I'm not a lawyer but the initial legal argument being made
                    by Disney seems to me to be pure bad faith horseshit. This
                    piece in New York Magazine looks at the lawsuit stemming
                    from the allergic reaction death of a doctor named Amy
                    Tangsuan at a Disney World Resort restaurant:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        Tangsuan was allergic to dairy and nuts, and before she
                        and her husband ordered, (they) asked a waiter whether
                        any of the allergens were in her order... The waiter
                        consulted with the chef, and then assured her that they
                        could be made dairy- and nut-free.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        About 45 minutes after Tangsuan ate, she went into an
                        anaphylactic shock so severe her EpiPen was useless. She
                        died soon after at a nearby hospital. In February, her
                        husband filed a wrongful-death suit against the
                        restaurant and Disney's theme-parks division, seeking
                        money damages.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    [...] Did they try this now abandoned tactic to save money?
                    Of course. But it sounds like they're really doing it to
                    save face — by moving cases to arbitration, it's permanently
                    out of the public's view; however the case is settled, the
                    general public will almost certainly be in the dark. PR
                    problem of killing guests thus solved.

              </blockquote>
              <p>
                So they will not try that again until next time that they do ...

                    the astronaut duo have been working with the Expedition 71
                    crew, performing scientific research and maintenance

                    NASA now plans to conduct two reviews – a Program Control
                    Board and an Agency Flight Readiness Review – before
                    deciding how it will safely return Wilmore and Williams from
                    the station. NASA expects to decide on the path forward by

                    the International Space Station with astronauts. The flight
                    test aims to prove the system is ready for rotational
                    missions to the space station. NASA wants two American
                    spacecraft, in addition to the Roscosmos Soyuz spacecraft,
                    capable of carrying astronauts to help ensure a permanent
                    crew aboard the orbiting complex.

                  <p>
                    This flight test aims to demonstrate Starliner’s ability to
                    execute a six-month rotational mission to the space station.
                    The flight test objectives were developed to support NASA’s
                    certification process and gather the performance data needed
                    to evaluate readiness ahead of long-duration flights.

                    During Starliner’s flight to the space station, some of the
                    spacecraft’s thrusters did not perform as expected and
                    several leaks in Starliner’s helium system were observed.
                    While the initial mission duration was planned for about a
                    week, there is no rush to bring crew home, so NASA and
                    Boeing are taking additional time to learn about the
                    spacecraft. This is a lesson learned from the space shuttle
                    Columbia accident. Our NASA and Boeing teams are poring over
                    data from additional in-space and ground testing and
                    analysis, providing mission managers data to make the best,
                    safest decision on how and when to return crew home.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Starliner remains the primary option for Butch and Suni if
                    an emergency occurs and they need to rapidly depart the
                    station. There is no urgent need to bring them home, and
                    NASA is using the extra time to understand the spacecraft’s
                    technical issues before deciding on a return plan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If NASA decides to return Starliner uncrewed, Butch and Suni
                    would remain aboard station until late-February 2025. NASA
                    would replan the agency’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission by launching
                    only two crew members instead of four in late September.
                    Butch and Suni would then return to Earth after the
                    regularly scheduled Crew-9 increment early next year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No decisions have been made. NASA continues to evaluate all
                    options as it learns more about Starliner’s propulsion
                    system. Butch and Suni may return home aboard Starliner, or
                    they could come back as part of the agency’s SpaceX Crew-9
                    mission early next year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yes, Starliner can undock and deorbit autonomously, if NASA
                    decides to return the spacecraft uncrewed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If NASA decides to return them aboard a SpaceX Dragon, NASA
                    will replan its SpaceX Crew-9 mission by launching only two
                    crew members in late September instead of four. Butch and
                    Suni would then return to Earth after the regularly
                    scheduled Crew-9 increment early next year.

                  <p>
                    The main goal of the agency’s Commercial Crew Program is
                    two, unique human spaceflight systems. Should any one system
                    encounter an issue, NASA still has the capability to launch
                    and return crew to ensure safety and a continuous human
                    presence aboard the International Space Station.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No, Butch and Suni are safe aboard the space station working
                    alongside the Expedition 71 crew. They also have been
                    actively involved in Starliner testing and technical
                    meetings. Butch and Suni could return home aboard Starliner
                    if an emergency arises. The agency also has other return
                    options available, if needed, for both contingency and
                    normal returning planning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Butch and Suni each have previously completed two
                    long-duration stays aboard the station. NASA astronauts
                    embark on missions fully aware of the various scenarios that
                    may become reality. This mission is no different, and they
                    understood the possibilities and unknowns of this test
                    flight, including being aboard station longer than planned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A typical stay aboard the International Space Station is
                    about six months, and NASA astronauts also have remained on
                    the space station for

                    long-duration spaceflight and its effects on the human body,
                    which the agency applies to any crew mission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yes. The International Space Station is well-stocked with
                    everything the crew needs, including food, water, clothing,
                    and oxygen. Additionally, NASA and its space station
                    partners frequently launch resupply missions to the orbiting
                    complex carrying additional supplies and cargo.

                    science experiments, maintenance tasks, and assisted with
                    spacewalk preparations. Some of the science they’ve recently
                    completed includes new ways to

                    Butch and Suni enjoy many of the same comforts we have here

                    NASA has two unique American space transportation systems
                    capable of carrying crew to and from station. Although no
                    decisions have been made, NASA is considering several
                    options to return Butch and Suni from the space station,
                    including returning aboard Starliner, if cleared, or as part
                    of the agency’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission in February 2025.

                    Crewed test flights are inherently risky, and although
                    rotation missions may seem routine, they also are not
                    without risk. It is NASA’s job to evaluate that risk and
                    determine whether it is acceptable for the crew ahead of
                    each flight.

                    finalize Starliner return plans. NASA also is looking at
                    crew assignments to ensure Butch and Suni can return with
                    Crew-9, if needed.

                    Microsoft's Patch Tuesday for August 2024 includes a fix for
                    a security vulnerability in the Grub2 boot loader, which is
                    used by many Linux operating systems. Tracked as

                    out-of-bounds write with a potential bypass of

                    protection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Grub2 boot loader provides compatibility with the Secure
                    Boot technology on PCs running Linux systems. After
                    installing the new patch, Windows applies a Secure Boot
                    Advanced Targeting (SBAT) policy to block vulnerable Linux
                    boot loaders that could compromise OS security.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft explained that the SBAT value would not be applied
                    to dual-boot systems with both Windows and Linux on the boot
                    drive, so the patch was expected not to impact these
                    systems. However, many users with dual-boot configurations
                    have reported that the CVE-2022-2601 update still rendered
                    booting into a Linux OS impossible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The issue appears to affect various Linux distributions,
                    including popular ones such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin OS,
                    Puppy Linux, and others. Affected systems typically display
                    a "Security Policy Violation" error at boot, indicating a
                    failed check on "shim SBAT data." Boot problems have been
                    reported on both dual-boot systems and on Windows devices
                    running Linux from an
                    <a href="https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/issues/2947"
                      >ISO image</a
                    >, USB drive, or optical media.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft's bulletin noted that only older Linux distros'
                    ISOs were expected to experience boot issues following the
                    CVE-2022-2601 patch. However, users with systems released in
                    2024 also seem to be affected. The only reliable way to
                    restore a bootable state appears to be disabling Secure Boot
                    entirely. Alternatively, users can

                    week.

                    Microsoft will begin sending a revised version of its
                    controversial Recall feature to Windows Insider PCs
                    beginning in October, according to an update published today
                    to the company's original blog post about the Recall
                    controversy. The company didn't elaborate further on
                    specific changes it's making to Recall beyond what it
                    already announced in June.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For those unfamiliar, Recall is a Windows service that runs
                    in the background on compatible PCs, continuously taking
                    screenshots of user activity, scanning those screenshots
                    with optical character recognition (OCR), and saving the OCR
                    text and the screenshots to a giant searchable database on
                    your PC. The goal, according to Microsoft, is to help users
                    retrace their steps and dig up information about things they
                    had used their PCs to find or do in the past.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem was that other users on the same PC, or
                    attackers with physical or remote access to your PC, could
                    easily access, view, and export those screenshots and the
                    OCR database since none of the information was encrypted at
                    rest or protected in any substantive way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft had planned to launch Recall as one of the
                    flagship features of its Copilot+ PC launch in July, along
                    with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered Surface devices,
                    but its rollout was bumped back and then paused entirely so
                    that Recall could be reworked and then sent out to Windows
                    Insiders for testing like most other Windows features are.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among the changes Microsoft has said it will make: The
                    database will be encrypted at rest and will require
                    authentication (and periodic reauthentication) with Windows
                    Hello before users will be allowed to access it. The feature
                    will also be off by default, whereas the original plan was
                    to turn it on by default and make users go into Settings to
                    turn it off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Security continues to be our top priority and when Recall
                    is available for Windows Insiders in October we will publish
                    a blog with more details," reads today's update to Microsoft
                    Windows and Devices Corporate Vice President Pavan
                    Davuluri's blog post.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the preview is released, Windows Insiders who want to
                    test the Recall preview will need to do it on a PC that
                    meets Microsoft's Copilot+ system requirements. Those
                    include a processor with a neural processing unit (NPU)
                    capable of at least 40 trillion operations per second
                    (TOPS), 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The x86 builds of
                    Windows for Intel and AMD processors don't currently support
                    any Copilot+ features regardless of whether the PC meets
                    those requirements, but that should change later this year.

                    Chen says that similar reactors have been tested before, but
                    the electrodes could not shuffle charges at a sufficient
                    voltage for the reaction to work – unless

                    were added to the wastewater. He and his colleagues made
                    their device more practical by filling its middle chamber
                    with a porous material that plays the role of those salts,
                    so wastewater can be fed directly into the reactor without
                    additives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In experiments with water samples that had realistic
                    concentrations of nitrates, the reactor processed 100
                    millilitres in about an hour, and it kept working well when
                    it ran for 10 days straight. Its performance is similar to
                    that of previous, more complicated reactor designs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team has only tested the reactor in the lab using
                    nitrate-rich water, not real wastewater samples, which
                    contain more than just nitrates, says Chen. But the
                    researchers eventually envision local businesses and farms
                    using these reactors to recycle wastewater, instead of
                    sending it to far-away treatment plants that waste its
                    ammonia-making potential.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the best-case scenario, a farm might have its own
                    reactor, powered by solar or wind power. Farmers could run
                    local wastewater through the device and immediately

                    GRAS ingredients support the safety of our food supply,”
                    said Pomeranz. “The court only ruled that the FDA’s practice

                    “As a result of the FDA’s policy, the food industry has been
                    free to ‘self-GRAS’ new substances they wish to add to
                    foods, without notifying FDA or the public,” said study
                    senior author Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is
                    Medicine Institute and distinguished professor at the
                    Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts
                    University. “There are now hundreds, if not thousands, of
                    substances added to our foods for which the true safety data
                    are unknown to independent scientists, the government, and

                    According to the researchers, the FDA also lacks a formal
                    approach and adequate resources to review those food
                    additives and GRAS substances already on the market. After
                    an ingredient is added to foods, if research later suggests

                    in March that it would be reviewing 21 chemicals found in

                    the thousands of food additives and GRAS substances used
                    today.

                  <p>
                    An example of the 21 food additives to be reviewed is
                    potassium bromate, a chemical added to baked goods and
                    drinks with evidence that it may cause cancer. Potassium
                    bromate is banned in Europe, Canada, China, and Japan;

                    “This is a stark example of the FDA’s regulatory gap,” said
                    Pomeranz. “We’re seeing states starting to act to fill the
                    regulatory void left by the FDA’s inaction over substances
                    increasingly associated with harm.”

                  <p>
                    The FDA’s oversight of GRAS ingredients on the market is
                    also limited. The agency rarely revokes GRAS designation (<a
                      href="https://www.fda.gov/food/generally-recognized-safe-gras/post-market-determinations-use-substance-not-gras"

                    only shows 15 substances that were considered GRAS and then
                    later determined to not be), nor does the FDA review foods
                    on an ongoing basis with GRAS ingredients that can be safe
                    when added at low levels but not in large quantities—for
                    instance, caffeine, salt, and sugar.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “In 1977, the FDA approved caffeine as a GRAS substance for
                    use in sodas at a low level: 0.02 percent,” said Pomeranz.
                    “But today, caffeine is added to energy drinks at levels far
                    exceeding this, which is causing caffeine-related
                    hospitalizations and even deaths. Given that the FDA
                    regulates the use of GRAS substances, the agency could set
                    limits on the amount of caffeine in energy drinks.”

                    find more opportunities for efficiency, a GM spokesperson
                    told the DCNF [Daily Caller News Foundataion]. Monday's job
                    cuts followed a decision by the two new GM executives from
                    Apple, Baris Cetinok and Dave Richardson, to streamline the
                    service and software business, sources familiar with the

                    would be affected at the company's global technical center
                    in Warren, Michigan.

                    Earlier this year, several authors sued NVIDIA over alleged
                    copyright infringement. The class action lawsuit alleged
                    that the company's AI models were trained on copyrighted
                    works and specifically mentioned Books3 data. Since this
                    happened without permission, the rightsholders demand
                    compensation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit was followed up by a near-identical case a few
                    weeks later, and NVIDIA plans to challenge both in court by
                    denying the copyright infringement allegations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In its initial response, filed a few weeks ago, NVIDIA did
                    not deny that it used the Books3 dataset. Like many other AI
                    companies, it believes that the use of copyrighted data for
                    AI training is a prime example of fair use; especially when
                    the output of the model doesn't reproduce copyrighted works.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The authors clearly have a different take. They allege that
                    NVIDIA willingly copied an archive of pirated books to train
                    its commercial AI model, and are demanding damages for
                    direct copyright infringement.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    [...] NVIDIA also shared its early outlook on the case. The
                    company believes that AI companies should be allowed to use
                    copyrighted books to train their AI models, as these books
                    are made up of "uncopyrightable facts and ideas" that are
                    already in the public domain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The argument may seem surprising at first; the authors own
                    copyrights and as far they're concerned, use of pirated
                    copies leads to liability as a direct infringer. However,
                    NVIDIA goes on to explain that their AI models don't see
                    these works that way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AI training doesn't involve any book reading skills, or even
                    a basic understanding of a storyline. Instead, it simply
                    measures statistical correlations and adds these to the
                    model.

                An interesting article about why legalese is written the way it
                is:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    A new study shows lawyers find simplified legal documents
                    easier to understand, more appealing, and just as
                    enforceable as traditional contracts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's no secret that legal documents are notoriously
                    difficult to understand, causing headaches for anyone who
                    has had to apply for a mortgage or review any other kind of
                    contract. A new MIT study reveals that the lawyers who
                    produce these documents don't like them very much either.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers found that while lawyers can interpret and
                    recall information from legal documents better than
                    nonlawyers, it's still easier for them to understand the
                    same documents when translated into "plain English." Lawyers
                    also rated plain English contracts as higher-quality
                    overall, more likely to be signed by a client, and equally
                    enforceable as those written in "legalese."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings suggest that while impenetrable styles of legal
                    writing are well-entrenched, lawyers may be amenable to
                    changing the way such documents are written.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "No matter how we asked the questions, the lawyers
                    overwhelmingly always wanted plain English," says Edward
                    Gibson, an MIT professor of brain and cognitive sciences and
                    the senior author of the study. "People blame lawyers, but I
                    don't think it's their fault. They would like to change it,
                    too."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eric Martínez, an MIT graduate student and licensed
                    attorney, is the lead author of the new study, which appears
                    this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
                    Sciences. Frank Mollica, a former visiting researcher at MIT
                    who is now a lecturer in computational cognitive science at
                    the University of Edinburgh, is also an author of the
                    <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2302672120"

                    Finding a total of 332 instances of identifying information
                    profiles on those sites, Consumer Reports found that only
                    117 profiles were removed within four months using all the
                    services, or 35 percent. The services varied in efficacy,
                    with EasyOptOuts notably performing the second-best at a 65
                    percent removal rate after four months. But if your goal is
                    to remove entirely others' ability to find out about you, no
                    service Consumer Reports tested truly gets you there.

                    Manual opt-outs were the most effective removal method, at
                    70 percent removed within one week, which is both a higher
                    elimination rate and quicker turn-around than all the
                    automated services.

                    [...] As Chicken Soup sorts through its debts and
                    liquidation, customers are left without guidance about what
                    to do with their rental DVDs or how they can access
                    movies/shows they purchased. But when it comes to purchases
                    made via streaming services, it's more accurate to consider
                    them rentals, despite them not being labeled as such and
                    costing more than rentals with set time limits. As we've
                    seen before, streaming companies can quickly yank away
                    content that people feel that they paid to own, be it due to

                    [...] The researchers said the findings, published in the
                    journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science, suggests horses
                    have the ability to form an internal model of the world
                    around them to make decisions and predictions, a technique
                    known as model-based learning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was previously thought that model-based learning was too
                    complex for horses because they have an underdeveloped
                    pre-frontal cortex, a part of the brain associated with
                    strategic thinking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr Ijichi said this suggests that the hoses "must be using
                    another area of the brain to achieve a similar result".

                    She said: "This teaches us that we shouldn't make
                    assumptions about animal intelligence or sentience based on
                    whether they are 'built' just like us."

                    bad news for uBlock Origin.

                      >PCWorld</a

                    certain features that the popular ad-blocker relies on. The
                    Chrome update "aims to... improve the privacy, security, and
                    performance of extensions," by changing the way it manages
                    API requests. That means with the upcoming Chrome update,
                    uBlock Origin will be automatically disabled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The popular ad-blocker, which has over 30 million
                    users, reportedly still works. But a disclaimer at the top
                    of extension page says, "This extension may soon no longer
                    be supported because it doesn't follow best practices for
                    Chrome extensions."

                    Developer Raymond Hill who makes uBlock Origin has scrambled

                      >uBlock Origin Lite</a

                    200,000 users, and still has standard ad-blocking
                    capabilities, but is less dynamic in the sense that it
                    requires the user to allow or block permissions on a
                    "per-site basis." In a GitHub

                    >
                    about the new extension, Hill explained that it isn't
                    intended to be a replacement for the original.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I consider uBO Lite to be too different from uBO to be an
                    automatic replacement," said the developer. "You will have
                    to explicitly find a replacement to uBO according to what
                    you expect from a content blocker. uBO Lite may or may not
                    fulfill your expectations."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    uBlock Origin still works on other browsers, so you could
                    always switch to a Chrome alternative like Firefox or Edge.
                    But if you want to stick with Chrome, you have to play by
                    Chrome's rules, and that means getting a different
                    ad-blocker.

                    Typically, the ratio between high alcohol groups and lager
                    ester amounts ranges between 3-4:1, with higher ratios
                    offering a drier, less aromatic beer. The team recorded
                    their control samples as having a ratio of 1.4:1, while
                    their microgravity beer measured 4.6:1, implying the latter
                    was "less aromatic by this measure." Meanwhile, two esters
                    in particular, isoamyl acetate and 2-phenethyl acetate,
                    showed "significant differences" between microgravity and
                    controls. Higher concentrations of these esters produce a
                    fruity, banana-like flavor in beers that many drinkers often
                    consider undesirable. In the microgravity brews, a
                    "multiple-fold decrease" in ester concentration compared to
                    the standard examples.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Depending upon the brewery, these compounds may be
                    desirable; however, the presence of these compounds above a
                    detection threshold would usually be considered a defect,"
                    the team writes. Given this, their microgravity results
                    offered a final product "that would be considered higher
                    quality due to the reduced esters.

                    "Operation of the 2×2 prototype in a neutrino beam will
                    usher in a new era of high-fidelity, inherently 3D LArTPC
                    images for neutrino interaction measurements," Russell said.

                    The final version of the DUNE near detector will feature 35
                    liquid argon modules, each larger than those in the
                    prototype. The modules will help navigate the enormous flux
                    of neutrinos expected at the near site.

                  <p>
                    The 2×2 prototype implements novel technologies that enable
                    a new regime of detailed, cutting-edge neutrino imaging to
                    handle the unique conditions in DUNE. It has a
                    millimeter-sized pixel readout system, developed by a team
                    at Berkeley Lab, that allows for high-precision 3D imaging
                    on a large scale. This, coupled with its modular design,
                    sets the prototype apart from previous neutrino detectors
                    like ICARUS and MicroBooNE.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, the 2×2 prototype provides the first
                    accelerator-neutrino data to be analyzed and published by
                    the DUNE collaboration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    DUNE is split between two locations hundreds of miles apart:
                    A beam of neutrinos originating at Fermilab, close to
                    Chicago, will pass through a particle detector located on
                    the Fermilab site, then travel 800 miles through the ground
                    to several huge detectors at the Sanford Underground
                    Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The DUNE detector at Fermilab will analyze the neutrino beam
                    close to its origin, where the beam is extremely intense.
                    Collaborators expect this near detector to record about 50
                    interactions per pulse, which will come every second,
                    amounting to hundreds of millions of neutrino detections
                    over DUNE's many expected years of operation. Scientists
                    will also use DUNE to study neutrinos' antimatter
                    counterpart, antineutrinos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This unprecedented flux of accelerator-made neutrinos and
                    antineutrinos will enable DUNE's ambitious science goals.
                    Physicists will study the particles with DUNE's near and far
                    detectors to learn more about how they change type as they
                    travel, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. By
                    looking for differences between neutrino oscillations and
                    antineutrino oscillations, physicists will seek evidence for
                    a broken symmetry known as CP violation to determine whether
                    neutrinos might be responsible for the prevalence of matter
                    in our universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The DUNE collaboration is made up of more than 1,400
                    scientists and engineers from over 200 research
                    institutions. Nearly 40 of these institutions work on the
                    near detector. Specifically, the hardware development of the
                    2×2 prototype was led by the University of Bern in
                    Switzerland, DOE's Fermilab, Berkeley Lab, and SLAC National
                    Accelerator Laboratory, with significant contributions from
                    many universities.

                    There's many legends in computer history. But a legend is
                    nothing but a story. Someone tells it, someone else
                    remembers it, and everybody passes it on. And the Apple IIGS
                    has a legend all its own. Here, in Userlandia, we're going
                    to bust some megahertz myths.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I love the Apple IIGS. It's the fabulous home computer you'd
                    have to be crazy to hate. One look at its spec sheet will
                    tell you why. The Ensoniq synthesizer chip brings 32 voices
                    of polyphonic power to the desktop. Apple's Video Graphics
                    Controller paints beautiful on-screen pictures from a
                    palette of thousands of colors. Seven slots and seven ports
                    provide plenty of potential for powerful peripherals. These
                    ingredients make a great recipe for a succulent home
                    computer. But you can't forget the most central ingredient:
                    the central processing unit. It's a GTE 65SC816 clocked at
                    2.8 MHz—about 2.72 times faster than an Apple IIe. When the
                    IIGS launched in September 1986 its contemporaries were
                    systems like the Atari 1040ST, the Commodore Amiga 1000, and
                    of course Apple's own Macintosh Plus. These machines all
                    sported a Motorola 68000 clocked between 7 and 8 MHz. If I
                    know anything about which number is bigger than the other
                    number, I'd say that Motorola's CPU is faster.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Now hold on there," you say! "Megahertz is just the clock
                    speed of the chip—it says nothing about how many
                    instructions are actually executed during those cycles, let
                    alone the time spent reading and writing to RAM!" And you
                    know what, that's true! The Apple II and Commodore 64 with
                    their 6502 and 6510 CPUs clocked at 1 MHz could trade blows
                    with Z80 powered computers running at three times the clock
                    speed. And the IIGS had the 6502's 16-bit descendant: the
                    65C816. Steve Wozniak thought Western Design Center had
                    something special with that chip.

                    Crucially, said Fischer-Gödde, the result is different to
                    the composition generally found on Earth, ruling out a
                    theory that the presence of ruthenium and other metals such
                    as osmium and platinum, are down to past eruptions of the
                    Deccan Traps volcanoes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team also cast doubt on the possibility that the
                    impactor was a comet, saying the ruthenium isotope
                    composition of the samples is different to that of
                    meteorites thought to be fragments of comets that have lost
                    their ice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Fischer-Gödde said C-type asteroids can today be found
                    in the asteroid belt that sits between Mars and Jupiter
                    because, not long after the formation of the solar system,
                    Jupiter migrated, scattering asteroids in the process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result, he suggests the ill-fated space rock probably
                    came from there.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Maybe there was a collision of two asteroid bodies in the
                    belt, and then this chunk kind of went on an Earth-crossing
                    orbit. That could be one scenario," he said, although he
                    noted there are other possibilities, including that it came
                    from the Oort cloud that is thought to surround the solar
                    system.
