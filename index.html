                    At first we were wondering whether these options would be
                    enabled by default before the new release. We did not have
                    to wait long. This

                    PerSourcePenalties will be enabled by default, and admins
                    who do not themselves run PF or other network translation
                    mechanisms will need to keep the consequences of
                    inconsiderate NAT use in mind.

                    Microsoft is revamping how Recall works amid its PR
                    nightmare<br />By<br />Rich Woods
                  </p>
                  <p>Key Takeaways</p>
                  <p>
                            -Microsoft promised groundbreaking features with
                    Copilot+, including Cocreator and Live Captions, but Recall
                    has become a PR nightmare.<br />
                            -Concerns about Recall being a security risk have
                    led to backlash and panic among users due to data access
                    vulnerabilities.<br />
                            -Microsoft has been silent on Recall issues but is
                    finally taking action to address the security concerns and
                    ensure user control.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <p>
                    One of the key complaints about Recall is that it was
                    opt-out. In the setup experience, Windows just tells you
                    that it's on, and lets you check a box to open settings
                    after setup is complete. Now, you'll have to choose to turn
                    it on during the out-of-box experience, so it's totally
                    opt-in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Secondly, you'll have to use Windows Hello in order to turn
                    on Recall. The idea is that in order to access it, Windows
                    will have to know it's you.<br />
                      Finally, Windows is going to use just-in-time decryption,
                    meaning everything will be encrypted until you've been
                    authenticated. Microsoft also confirmed that it's encrypted
                    the search index database, which was one of the key
                    call-outs in the report from earlier this week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft also noted that all Copilot+ PCs are Secured-core,
                    so they're designed to be secure. They have Microsoft Pluton
                    security chips, so there's hardware-level protection going
                    on there.<br />

                And, all of this makes sense because we know that security chips
                can't be hacked, because they are secure chips, right? /sarcasm

                Oh yeah, the data never leaves your PC. Unless, of course, you
                do a backup to the cloud, right? In which case your data may be
                in Sri Lanka, Timbuktu, Israel, or, maybe even Ireland. And,
                police forces in third world banana republics never get warrants
                for whatever might be on the server.
              </p>
              <p>
                The best thing Microsoft can do with CoPilot, is to deep six it.
                Better yet, deep six all of their "telemetry" along with
                CoPilot.

                It isn't favorable to the car companies, which (historically) is

                I tried it on a 10 year old car and it pretty much matched what
                I expected -- no Wi-Fi, no linking to phones, but possible data
                collected if satellite radio was used (it's not).

                    Of all the data that car companies can potentially capture,
                    one of the most eye-opening from the Mozilla report was
                    people having sex in vehicles. "One of the things that
                    everybody latched onto was Nissan and Kia saying they could
                    collect information on your sex life or your sexual
                    activity," Caltrider said. "That really freaked people out."
                    While the researchers couldn't determine exactly how the
                    automakers would gather data on sexual activity in cars, the
                    educated guess is it wouldn't be that hard for cameras and
                    sensors to gather the information necessary.

                  <p>
                    After the Mozilla Foundation report was released, Kia
                    Connect Services (a suite of services Kia extends to its
                    vehicle owners) and Nissan USA removed wording about
                    collecting information on sexual activity from their online
                    privacy policies, Caltrider said. She sent us a PDF of the
                    original wording on the Nissan site, and under Types of
                    Personal Data collected, it read: "Sensitive personal
                    information, including ... sexual orientation, sexual
                    activity, precise geolocation, health diagnosis data, and
                    genetic information." On Kia's broader corporate privacy
                    page under Sensitive Personal Information as of press time,
                    it still read, "This category may include ... sex life or

                Historically, high-speed rail travel by
                <i>Train a Grande Vitesse</i> (TGV) in France was the monopoly
                of the French national rail service, SNCF.

                Under EU rules, all national operators have to make their rail
                system available to other willing operators. So in 2021,
                Trentalia, a unit of Italy's state rail operator, decided to
                offer high-speed train rides in France too.

                It might be noteworthy that earlier this year, the EU decided to
                speed-up the implementation of the TEN-T network. The TEN-T is
                an EU-wide network of rail, inland waterways, short-sea shipping
                routes, and roads. It connects 424 major cities with ports,
                airports and railway terminals. When the TEN-T is complete, it
                will cut travel times between these cities. For example,
                passengers will be able to travel between Copenhagen and Hamburg
                in 2.5 hours by train, instead of the 4.5 hours required today.

                    During an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,
                    comedian Larry David explained that his New Year's
                    Resolution was "make two trips" (episode 857, January 8,
                    2020).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, when carrying groceries into the house, it is
                    tempting to carry everything at once, but then you drop the
                    cantaloupe, and now you have to clean up that mess. While it
                    seemed like one trip would have been faster, if you include
                    the time it takes to clean up the mess, it would have been
                    faster to simply make two trips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This "make two trips" strategy isn't an
                    earth-shattering breakthrough. It won't cure cancer, end
                    world hunger, or fix the climate crisis. However, I have
                    adopted this philosophy, and it has had many benefits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The immediate benefit is that I am now more likely to have a
                    free hand to open my house door. Pulling keys out of my
                    pocket no longer involves smashing a grocery bag between my
                    chest and the house.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The larger benefit has come from adopting this philosophy in
                    both coding and operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The other day, I was adding a feature to some old code. The
                    code reported results of an earlier calculation with various
                    formatting options that could be enabled or disabled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The code was quite complex because certain options affected
                    the format in ways that had downstream implications for
                    other options. The code was able to satisfy all the various
                    options and controls in one pass over the data, printing a
                    report along the way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I struggled in earnest to add my new feature to this
                    ever-growing complicated loop.
                  </p>
                  <p>Then I remembered Larry's advice: Make two trips.</p>
                  <p>
                    The code would be significantly simpler if it made two
                    passes over the data. One pass would collect data, count
                    things that needed to be counted, sum subtotals, and so on.
                    The second pass would take all this information and output
                    the report, and would be much easier because it had all the
                    information it needed from the start. No Schrödinger's cat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It was a classic complexity vs. memory engineering
                    decision: Suffer from complexity or suffer from potential
                    memory exhaustion.

                    [...] The implications of this technology extend beyond
                    lunar rovers to broader applications in spacecraft thermal
                    management. Integrating EHD technology into thermal fluid
                    control systems could improve heat transfer efficiency and
                    mitigate operational challenges. In the future, this could
                    play an important role in space exploration.

                    The development of this heat-switch device marks an
                    important milestone in developing technology for long-term
                    lunar missions and other space exploration endeavors. All of
                    which means that, in the future, lunar rovers and other
                    spacecraft should be better equipped to operate in the
                    extreme environments of space.

                    social sciences (HSS) and 81 in science, technology,
                    engineering, art/design, and mathematics (STEAM). The data

                    are used 3.75 times more and receive 21 percent more
                    citations than their paywalled counterparts. Open-access
                    books in STEAM fields are used 2.67 times more and receive
                    15 percent more citations than their non-open counterparts,
                    on average. Regardless of their field, D2O books are making

                    Programming style is not a matter of efficiency in a
                    program. It is a matter of how easy it is to write or read a
                    program, how easy it is to explain the program to someone
                    else, how easy it is to figure out what the program does a
                    year after you've written it; and above all, style is a
                    matter of taste, of aesthetics, of what you think looks
                    nice, of what you think is elegant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although style is mainly a matter of taste, a programmer
                    with a "good" style will find his programs easy to write,
                    easy to read, and easy to explain to others. ...

                  <p>
                    In particular, you may have acquired special programming
                    tricks that you are very fond of, and that aren't used by
                    other programmers, but that don't make your programs much
                    more efficient. I urge you to stop using those tricks. As
                    Samuel Johnson once said, "Read over your compositions, and
                    when you meet with a passage which you think is particularly
                    fine, strike it out."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In other words, make your style simple, not complicated,
                    even though the complicated style may seem to have some
                    abstract virtues. ...

                So contestants from all over the world can gather and compete
                for the title of "Miss AI".

                Excerpt from RT:<br />------------------<br />The event, called
                'Miss AI', is being organized by the World AI Creator Awards
                (WAICA) in collaboration with Fanvue – an OnlyFans-like
                subscription-based platform that already hosts a number of
                virtual models, including those who offer adult content.
              </p>
              <p>
                The digital contestants hoping to secure the Miss AI crown will
                be judged on their beauty, underlying tech, as well as their
                social media pull, according to WAICA's official website. The AI
                creator's "social media clout" will also be assessed based on
                their engagement numbers with fans, rate of audience growth, and
                ability to utilize social media platforms such as Instagram.<br />---------------------

                I don't quite know what to make of this. There are so many
                viewpoints and I hope to see what others feel about it. One
                thing, it's an inevitable outcome of combining our technology
                and artistic expression, even done on ancient cave walls. Soon
                our digital presence can be tailored to anything we want it to
                be. Work from home. Zoom calls ( with your AI proxy, of course,
                which would handle as many simultaneous interactions as your
                server technology can handle ).

                    The Devcore writeup said that the researchers have confirmed
                    that XAMPP is vulnerable when Windows is configured to use
                    the locales for Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, or
                    Japanese. In Windows, a locale is a set of user preference
                    information related to the user's language, environment,
                    and/or cultural conventions. The researchers haven't tested
                    other locales and have urged people using them to perform a
                    comprehensive asset assessment to test their usage
                    scenarios.

                Interested in a career selling virtual meatballs at IKEA? I
                guess it's some kind of gimmick between IKEA and Roblox but it
                seems somewhat weird, selling virtual products in a virtual

                    These decryption keys were uncovered by the FBI after a
                    massive joint operation disrupted LockBit earlier this year,
                    though the gang appears to still be operational.

                    The US FBI has revealed that it has more than 7,000
                    decryption keys to help victims of the notorious LockBit
                    ransomware gang.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These decryption keys were recovered by the FBI as a result
                    of a

                    >
                    international law enforcement conducted against LockBit
                    earlier this year. This gang provides
                    ransomware-as-a-service to a global network of ‘affiliates’,
                    giving criminals tools to carry out their own cyberattacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In February, the joint operation managed to take down
                    LockBit’s data leak website and managed to uncover a large
                    amount of data about the gang and its activities.
                    Authorities also seized the decryption keys that the FBI is
                    now offering to victims.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a recent statement, the FBI’s cyber assistant director
                    Bryan Vorndran claimed LockBit was the most deployed
                    ransomware variant in the world by 2022 and that the gang
                    has caused “billions of dollars in damages to victims”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “We are reaching out to known LockBit victims and
                    encouraging anyone who suspects they were a victim to visit
                    our Internet Crime Complaint Center,” Vorndran said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Raj Samani, SVP and chief scientist at Rapid7, said
                    the release of these decryption keys is “another kick in the
                    teeth” for the LockBit gang and “a great win for law
                    enforcement”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The likes of LockBit survive and thrive on victims paying
                    ransom demands, therefore, it’s great to see the US
                    government be proactive and prevent this by releasing the
                    decryption keys for free,” Samani said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Ever since law enforcement took down LockBit’s
                    infrastructure in February 2024, they’ve engaged in PR and
                    damage control in order to show strength and maintain the
                    confidence of affiliates. However, such announcements by the
                    FBI damages this confidence, and hopefully we’ll soon see
                    the end of the LockBit ransomware group.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not everyone is so optimistic however. Ricardo Villadiego,
                    the founder and CEO of cybersecurity firm Lumu, told
                    SiliconRepublic.com recently that gangs such as LockBit are

                      >prepared for these potential risks</a
                    > – evident by the fact that the gang was offering its
                    services again in “less than four days”.

                    While most algorithms operate near perfectly on their own,
                    Peter Grantcharov explains that the OR black box is still
                    not fully autonomous. For example, it's difficult to capture
                    audio through ceiling mikes and thus get a reliable
                    transcript to document whether every element of the surgical
                    safety checklist was completed; he estimates that this
                    algorithm has a 15% error rate. So before the output from
                    each procedure is finalized, one of the Toronto analysts
                    manually verifies adherence to the questionnaire. "It will
                    require a human in the loop," Peter Grantcharov says, but he
                    gauges that the AI model has made the process of confirming
                    checklist compliance 80% to 90% more efficient. He also
                    emphasizes that the models are constantly being improved.

                  <p>
                    In all, the OR black box can cost about $100,000 to install,
                    and analytics expenses run $25,000 annually, according to
                    Janet Donovan, an OR nurse who shared with
                    <em>MIT Technology Review</em> an estimate given to staff at
                    Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital in Massachusetts.
                    (Peter Grantcharov declined to comment on these numbers,
                    writing in an email: "We don't share specific pricing;
                    however, we can say that it's based on the product mix and
                    the total number of rooms, with inherent volume-based
                    discounting built into our pricing models.")

                    [...] At some level, the identity protections are only half
                    measures. Before 30-day-old recordings are automatically
                    deleted, Grantcharov acknowledges, hospital administrators
                    can still see the OR number, the time of operation, and the
                    patient's medical record number, so even if OR personnel are
                    technically de-identified, they aren't truly anonymous. The
                    result is a sense that "Big Brother is watching," says
                    Christopher Mantyh, vice chair of clinical operations at
                    Duke University Hospital, which has black boxes in seven
                    ORs. He will draw on aggregate data to talk generally about
                    quality improvement at departmental meetings, but when
                    specific issues arise, like breaks in sterility or a cluster
                    of infections, he will look to the recordings and "go to the
                    surgeons directly."

                    In many ways, that's what worries Donovan, the Faulkner
                    Hospital nurse. She's not convinced the hospital will
                    protect staff members' identities and is worried that these
                    recordings will be used against them—whether through
                    internal disciplinary actions or in a patient's malpractice
                    suit. In February 2023, she and almost 60 others sent a
                    letter to the hospital's chief of surgery objecting to the
                    black box. She's since filed a grievance with the state,
                    with arbitration proceedings scheduled for October.

                    for nearly a year and a half now, following the late 2022
                    release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But despite transformative
                    effects on companies’ share prices, generative AI tools
                    powered by large language models (LLMs) still have major
                    drawbacks that have kept them from being as useful as many
                    would like them to be. Retrieval augmented generation, or
                    RAG, aims to fix some of those drawbacks.

                    (also called “hallucination”), which is a statistical
                    gap-filling phenomenon AI language models produce when they
                    are tasked with reproducing knowledge that wasn’t present in
                    the training data. They generate plausible-sounding text
                    that can veer toward accuracy when the training data is
                    solid but otherwise may just be completely made up.

                    Relying on confabulating AI models gets people and companies

                    by blending the LLM process with a web search or other
                    document look-up process” to help LLMs stick to the facts,
                    according to Noah Giansiracusa, associate professor of
                    mathematics at Bentley University.

                    [...] Although RAG is now seen as a technique to help fix
                    issues with generative AI, it actually predates ChatGPT.

                    University.

                    As we've mentioned, LLMs struggle with facts. Google’s entry
                    into the generative AI race, Bard,

                      >made an embarrassing error</a

                    on its first public demonstration back in February 2023
                    about the James Webb Space Telescope. The error wiped around
                    $100 billion off the value of parent company Alphabet. LLMs
                    produce the most statistically likely response based on
                    their training data and don’t understand anything they
                    output, meaning they can present false information that
                    seems accurate if you don't have expert knowledge on a
                    subject.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    LLMs also lack up-to-date knowledge and the ability to
                    identify gaps in their knowledge. “When a human tries to
                    answer a question, they can rely on their memory and come up
                    with a response on the fly, or they could do something like
                    Google it or peruse Wikipedia and then try to piece an
                    answer together from what they find there—still filtering
                    that info through their internal knowledge of the matter,”
                    said Giansiracusa.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But LLMs aren’t humans, of course. Their training data can
                    age quickly, particularly in more time-sensitive queries. In
                    addition, the LLM often can’t distinguish specific sources
                    of its knowledge, as all its training data is blended
                    together into a kind of soup.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In theory, RAG should make keeping AI models up to date far
                    cheaper and easier. “The beauty of RAG is that when new
                    information becomes available, rather than having to retrain
                    the model, all that’s needed is to augment the model’s
                    external knowledge base with the updated information,” said
                    Peterson. “This reduces LLM development time and cost while
                    enhancing the model’s scalability.”

                    MDMA, sometimes called Molly or ecstasy, has been banned in
                    the United States for more than three decades. Now this
                    potent mind-altering drug is poised to become a badly needed
                    therapy for PTSD.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On June 4, the Food and Drug Administration's advisory
                    committee will meet to discuss the risks and benefits of
                    MDMA therapy. If the committee votes in favor of the drug,
                    it could be approved to treat PTSD this summer. The approval
                    would represent a momentous achievement for proponents of
                    mind-altering drugs, who have been working toward this goal
                    for decades. And it could help pave the way for FDA approval
                    of other illicit drugs like psilocybin. But the details
                    surrounding how these compounds will make the transition
                    from illicit substances to legitimate therapies are still
                    foggy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, for drugs that carry a risk of serious side
                    effects, the FDA can add a risk evaluation and mitigation
                    strategy to its approval. For MDMA that might include
                    mandating that the health-care professionals who administer
                    the medication have certain certifications or specialized
                    training, or requiring that the drug be dispensed only in
                    licensed facilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, Spravato, a nasal spray approved in 2019 for
                    depression that works much like ketamine, is available only
                    at a limited number of health-care facilities and must be
                    taken under the observation of a health-care provider.
                    Having safeguards in place for MDMA makes sense, at least at
                    the outset, says Matt Lamkin, an associate professor at the
                    University of Tulsa College of Law who has been following
                    the field closely.: "Given the history, I think it would
                    only take a couple of high-profile bad incidents to
                    potentially set things back."

                    This summer Compass Pathways will release the first results
                    from one of its phase 3 trials of psilocybin to treat
                    depression. Results from the other trial will come in the
                    middle of 2025, which—if all goes well—puts the company on
                    track to file for approval in the fall or winter of next
                    year. With the FDA review and the DEA rescheduling, "it's
                    still kind of two to three years out," Nath says.

                    Some states are moving ahead without formal approval. Oregon

                  <p>
                    While initially this looked like good news, almost three
                    months later, this has turned into a complete and utter
                    disaster.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the past months, the Linux Kernel team has issued
                    thousands of CVE identifiers, with the vast majority being
                    for trivial bug fixes and not just security flaws.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Just in May alone, the Linux team issued over 1,100 CVEs,
                    according to

                    Ironically, this was a disaster waiting to happen, with the

                    for issuing CVEs right after the moment it received its CNA
                    status.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We say weird because they are quite unique among all CNAs.
                    The Linux kernel team argues that because of the deep layer
                    where the kernel runs, bugs are hard to understand, and
                    there is always a possibility of them becoming a security
                    issue later down the line. Direct quote below:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        "Note, due to the layer at which the Linux kernel is in
                        a system, almost any bug might be exploitable to
                        compromise the security of the kernel, but the
                        possibility of exploitation is often not evident when
                        the bug is fixed. Because of this, the CVE assignment
                        team is overly cautious and assign CVE numbers to any
                        bugfix that they identify. This explains the seemingly
                        large number of CVEs that are issued by the Linux kernel
                        team."
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    [...] Instead, the Linux Kernel team appears to have adopted
                    a simpler approach where it puts a CVE on everything and
                    lets the software and infosec community at large confirm
                    that an issue is an authentic security flaw. If it's not,
                    it's on the security and vulnerability management firms to
                    file CVE revocation requests with the precise Linux Kernel
                    team that runs the affected component.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new Linux CNA rules also prohibit the issuance of CVEs
                    for bugs in EOL Linux kernels, which is also another weird
                    take on security. Just because you don't maintain the code
                    anymore, that doesn't mean attackers won't exploit it and
                    that people wouldn't want to track it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Linux team will also refuse to assign CVEs until a patch
                    has been deployed, meaning there will be no CVEs for
                    zero-days or vulnerabilities that may require a longer
                    reporting and patching timeline.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And if this isn't bad enough, the Linux kernel team
                    appears to be
                    <a
                      href="https://mastodon.social/@cadey@pony.social/112507861868449128"
                      >backfiling CVEs</a
                    >
                    for fixes to last year's code, generating even more noise
                    for people who use CVEs for legitimate purposes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Unfortunately, all of this CVE spam also could have
                    not happened at a worse time. Just as the Linux Kernel team
                    was getting its CNA status, NIST was
                    <a
                      href="https://news.risky.biz/risky-biz-news-nist-nvd-stopped-enriching-cves-last-month/"
                      >slowing down</a
                    >
                    its management of the NVD database—where all CVEs are
                    compiled and enriched.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NIST cited a staff shortage and a sudden rise in the number
                    of reported vulnerabilities—mainly from the IoT space.
                    Having one of every fifth CVE being a Linux non-security bug
                    isn't helping NIST at all right now.

                    In a burnished-oak corridor outside the committee room at
                    IBM's headquarters in August 1980, two engineers pace
                    nervously. Eventually, a door opens. Their boss, Bill Lowe,
                    emerges from the board room next door. Before they can say
                    anything, he smiles and nods. They laugh. They can't quite
                    believe it. It's official. IBM is going to try and build a
                    home computer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bill Lowe kicked off this ambitious project, but he wouldn't
                    be the person who would finish it. That role would fall to
                    his successor, a humble, cowboy boot-wearing mid-level
                    executive, out of favor and kicking his heels in the IBM
                    corporate backwater of Boca Raton, Florida. He would take
                    Lowe's project forward, one nobody else in the company
                    wanted. Just 12 months later, on August 15, 1981, a computer
                    would launch that would change the world: the IBM PC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is the story of Don Estridge, the man who brought the
                    IBM PC to market and changed business and home computing
                    forever. In just five years he created an IBM division that
                    almost nobody else in the company wanted to exist. By 1983,
                    it had seized 70 percent of the microcomputer market and was
                    valued at over $4 billion ($12 billion today). Under
                    Estridge, IBM's PC division sold over 1 million machines a
                    year, making it the third largest computer manufacturer in
                    the world on its own. This story is based on contemporary
                    accounts in publications such as InfoWorld, PC magazine,
                    Time, and the New York Times, as well as books such as Blue
                    Magic by James Chposky and Ted Leonsis; Big Blues by Paul
                    Carroll; and Fire in the Valley by Michael Swaine and Paul
                    Frieberger.

                    A study carried out by the University of Helsinki's DogRisk
                    research group, the University of Eastern Finland and Wise
                    Nose – Scent Discrimination Association in Finland
                    investigated the threshold for scent detection in dogs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study revealed that dogs can learn to identify
                    concentrations of eucalyptus hydrolate that are clearly
                    below the detection threshold of sophisticated analytical
                    instruments used today. The concentrations were also far
                    below previously reported levels. Dogs' extraordinary sense
                    of smell can be exploited, for example, in search and rescue
                    operations and in medical detection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 15 dogs that participated in the study had different
                    training backgrounds. Some dogs had experience of nose work,
                    which is a hobby and competitive dog sport, while some had
                    been trained to identify diseases, mould or pests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the study, the dogs were to differentiate samples
                    containing low concentrations of eucalyptus hydrolate from
                    samples containing only water. The focus was on determining
                    the lowest concentration that the dogs could detect for
                    certain. The study included three different tests where the
                    concentrations of the hydrolate were diluted gradually until
                    the dogs could no longer identify the scent. This determined
                    the threshold for their scent detection ability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The dogs' scent detection threshold initially varied from
                    1:10⁴–1:10²³ but narrowed down to 1:10¹⁷–1:10²¹ after a
                    training period. In other words, the dogs needed 1 to 10
                    molecules per millilitre of water to detect the right
                    sample. For perspective, a single yeast cell contains 42
                    million molecules," describes the principal investigator of
                    the study, Anna Hielm-Björkman from the University of
                    Helsinki.

                    The indigenous Marubo people, who for hundreds of years have
                    existed in small huts along the Itui River in the Amazon,
                    were connected to the billionaire's satellite network in
                    September.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The community embraced the technology, marvelling at the
                    life-saving ability to call for immediate help when
                    grappling with venomous snake bites as well as being able to
                    remain in contact with faraway relatives.

                  <p>
                    But, since a group of men arrived at the camp with antennas
                    strapped to their backs to connect the remote tribe of 2,000
                    people to the internet, there have been some less desirable
                    consequences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Critics warn tribe members have become "lazy", reclining in
                    hammocks all day glued to their phones to gossip on WhatsApp
                    or chat to strangers on Instagram.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And there have already been reports of young men engaging in
                    aggressive sexual behaviour after being exposed to
                    pornography, Alfredo Marubo, leader of a Marubo association
                    of villages, told The New York Times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Young men brought up in a culture where kissing in public is
                    seen as scandalous have been sharing explicit videos with
                    one another in group chats, he said, adding: "We're worried
                    young people are going to want to try it."<br />...<br />Kâipa
                    Marubo, a father of three, said he was concerned about his
                    children playing first-person shooter video games, fearing
                    they might want to mimic the attacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another leader, Enoque Marubo, 40, said the tribe has
                    started limiting the hours members could access the internet
                    because its introduction had "changed the routine so much
                    that it was detrimental".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Members can browse the internet for two hours in the morning
                    and five hours in the afternoon and all day on Sundays.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In the village, if you don't hunt, fish and plant, you
                    don't eat," Enoque said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Enoque worked with Brazilian activist Flora Dutra to bring
                    the internet to the tribe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They contacted American philanthropist Allyson Reneau, who
                    reportedly donated 20 Starlink units to the Marubo tribe.

                I wonder what ads they'll be shown based on their geolocation?
                Given how fast they learn, it shouldn't take long to figure out
                that content creation could be more lucrative than just
                consumption. Does Amazon deliver WebCams and lights in the

                    The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission
                    have reached a deal that clears the way for potential
                    antitrust investigations into the dominant roles that
                    Microsoft (MSFT.O), OpenAI and Nvidia (NVDA.O) , play in the
                    artificial intelligence industry, according to a source
                    familiar with the matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The agreement between the two agencies shows regulatory
                    scrutiny is gathering steam amid concerns over concentration
                    in the industries that make up AI. Microsoft and Nvidia not
                    only dominate their industries but are also the world's two
                    biggest companies by market capitalization.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The move to divvy up the industry mirrors a similar
                    agreement between the two agencies in 2019 to divide
                    enforcement against Big Tech, which ultimately saw the FTC
                    bring cases against Meta (META.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O), and
                    the DOJ sue Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) for alleged
                    violations. Those cases are ongoing and the companies have
                    denied wrongdoing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While OpenAI's parent is a nonprofit, Microsoft has invested
                    $13 billion in a for-profit subsidiary, for what would be a
                    49% stake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Justice Department will take the lead in investigating
                    whether Nvidia violated antitrust laws, while the FTC will
                    examine the conduct of OpenAI and Microsoft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The regulators struck the deal over the past week, and it is
                    expected to be completed in the coming days, the person
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nvidia has roughly 80% of the AI chip market, including the
                    custom AI processors made by the cloud computing companies

                    A multi-institutional team of plant specialists,
                    microbiologists and paleontologists in the Czech Republic
                    and the University of Minnesota, in the U.S., has found
                    evidence of a hot spring oasis during the last ice age in a
                    part of central Europe.
                  </p>

                    <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ado6611"
                      >study</a
                    >, reported in the journal <i>Science Advances</i>, the
                    group found and analyzed bits of leaves, wood and pollen in
                    the area around a modern freshwater spring.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Environmental scientists have long suggested that temporary
                    hot springs in parts of Europe may have helped trees and
                    other types of plants survive during the last ice age, but
                    there has been little evidence to prove the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this new effort, the research team ventured to freshwater
                    springs in the Vienna Basin looking for evidence of ancient
                    plant life. They suspected an oasis could have existed in
                    the area during the last ice age, as the weight of glaciers
                    sliding down the nearby Alps set off tectonic activity,
                    releasing geothermally heated water from deep within the
                    Earth's crust.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The release of warm water, the researchers reasoned, would
                    have formed an oasis, keeping the ground around the hot
                    springs warm enough for trees and other plants to survive
                    even though they would have been surrounded by ice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During their search, the research team found bits of wood,
                    pollen and fossilized bits of leaves from trees that should
                    not have been able to survive in the area during the last
                    ice—yet, they were dated to between 19,000 and 26,000 years
                    ago, a span of time that correlated to the last ice age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The findings strongly support the presence of an oasis
                    during the last ice age—one that helped some types of trees
                    survive despite the cold.

                    When you think about games written for the Atari Video
                    Computer System (or 2600) today, what do you picture? Likely
                    a home version of an arcade game, or some kind of shooter, a
                    maze game, something that takes place entirely on a single
                    screen. This is not the entirety of the 2600 library, though
                    – major releases such as
                    <i>Pitfall!, Adventure, E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial</i>, or
                    <i>Smurfs: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle</i> were built around
                    worlds that extended beyond the screen's borders, where you
                    didn't necessarily know what was coming next or how you'd
                    need to approach that challenge. And among the most
                    ambitious of these titles announced was <i>Tarzan</i>, to be
                    published by Coleco for the 2600 and the ColecoVision
                    console in 1984.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <i>Tarzan</i> was initially announced for as a 1983
                    ColecoVision release at the 1983 Winter Consumer Electronics
                    Show, held in Las Vegas, with a 2600 port announced later
                    that year during the summer CES for a November release.
                    These dates slipped, with the ColecoVision
                    <i>Tarzan</i> finally shipping in August, and the 2600 game
                    announced as a second quarter release before being quietly
                    canceled. The released ColecoVision version was fairly
                    well-reviewed, with the newsletter
                    <i>Computer Entertainer</i> praising the graphics and the
                    varied action, noting strategy is required to clear the
                    game. But the 2600 version faded into obscurity, considered
                    just another project canceled due to the 1983 North American
                    market collapse and its yearslong aftermath. In 2011 a
                    manual for the game turned up, but the game itself remained
                    lost. Lost, that is, until collector Rob "AtariSpot" managed
                    to purchase a working copy of the game off of a former
                    Coleco employee in 2022 and successfully worked with
                    longtime Atari homebrew programmer Thomas Jentzsch to get it
                    dumped. All 2600 games bigger than 4 kilobytes in size
                    utilize an approach called "bankswitching" to get around
                    hardware limitations by inserting code that gets the console
                    to look at a separate 4-kilobyte chunk of data. This allowed

                            remembered fallen friends. They relived horrors they
                            experienced in combat. They blessed their good
                            fortune for surviving. And they mourned those who

                    Adult content has always proliferated on Twitter, but the
                    platform now called X recently clarified its
                    <a

                  <p>
                    X's rules seem simple. As long as content is "properly
                    labeled and not prominently displayed," users can share
                    material—including AI-generated or animated content—"that is
                    pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We believe that users should be able to create, distribute,
                    and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it
                    is consensually produced and distributed," X's policy said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The policy update seemingly reflects X's core mission to
                    defend all legal speech. It protects a wide range of sexual
                    expression, including depictions of explicit or implicit
                    sexual behavior, simulated sexual intercourse, full or
                    partial nudity, and close-ups of genitals, buttocks, or
                    breasts.

                of my installations are on a <b>-STABLE</b> branch.

              <p>
                I suppose though, it might be a good time to

                    The social media platform currently allows people to swipe
                    or scroll past adverts that appear in its main feed of
                    images and videos, as well as in its Stories and Reels
                    feeds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it is now trialling a feature called "ad break", which
                    users say they can not flick past as usual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Images shared online show a timer, which counts down to zero
                    before normal functionality can resume.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Sometimes you may need to view an ad before you can keep
                    browsing," the Meta-owned platform tells those who click for
                    more information.

                    Instagram has confirmed to the BBC that a trial is under
                    way.

                    "We're always testing formats that can drive value for
                    advertisers," it said in a statement, adding that it would
                    provide further updates if the test resulted in permanent
                    format changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It remains to be seen if the trial pleases advertisers - but
                    it certainly does not appear to have gone down well with
                    users.

                    [...] Meta is not the first big tech firm to force people to
                    watch adverts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    YouTube is known for showing non-skippable ads to users
                    watching videos on its platform or TV app who do not pay for
                    its ad-free premium tier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Some users have responded by turning to ad blocking
                    tools and browser extensions as a way around adverts that
                    interrupt videos on the platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google, YouTube's parent company, is in turn trying to clamp
                    down on ad blockers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However it is not clear that forcing users to watch more ads
                    actually helps companies' bottom lines.

                    Cerebrovascular accidents, or strokes, are the most common
                    cause of aphasia, a speech disorder of cerebral origin.
                    People with aphasia have a reduced ability to understand or
                    produce speech or written language. An estimated 40% of
                    people who have had a stroke have aphasia. As many as half
                    of them experience aphasia symptoms even a year after the
                    original attack.

                    that sung music helps in the language recovery of patients
                    affected by strokes. Now, the researchers have uncovered the
                    reason for the rehabilitative effect of singing. The
                    recently completed study was published in the eNeuro
                    journal.

                  <p>
                    According to the findings, singing, as it were, repairs the
                    structural language network of the brain. The language
                    network processes language and speech in our brain. In
                    patients with aphasia, the network has been damaged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For the first time, our findings demonstrate that the
                    rehabilitation of patients with aphasia through singing is
                    based on neuroplasticity changes, that is, the plasticity of
                    the brain," says University Researcher

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The language network encompasses the cortical regions of the
                    brain involved in the processing of language and speech, as
                    well as the white matter tracts that convey information
                    between the different end points of the cortex.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the study results, singing increased the volume
                    of grey matter in the language regions of the left frontal
                    lobe and improved tract connectivity especially in the
                    language network of the left hemisphere, but also in the
                    right hemisphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These positive changes were associated with patients'
                    improved speech production," Sihvonen says.

                    Zen 5 is different from the XDNA 2 NPU architecture. You can
                    break up the TOPS speed in the NPU into a whole bunch of
                    other categories, but AMD claims XDNA 2 is two times as
                    power efficient and many times the total neural computing
                    capacity of the previous gen’s 10 or 16 TOPS.

                    For those who could not care less about the productivity
                    machines centering on the AI 300 chips, all you want to know
                    is how the Ryzen 9000 series stacks up compared to the last
                    generation and Intel’s latest. That includes the Ryzen 5
                    9600X, Ryzen 7 9700X, Ryzen 9 9900X, and at the tippy top
                    end is the Ryzen 9 9950X. Most boast slightly higher clock
                    speeds, but several, like the 9900x and 9700X, are far more
                    power efficient with better TDP.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To pick on the big boy, that 9950X has 16 cores, 32 threads,
                    and up to 5.7 GHz clock speeds. That’s technically the same
                    specs as the Ryzen 9 7950X3D from the last gen. AMD is
                    trying to hit Intel’s Core i9-14900K by claiming you’ll see
                    marginally better framerates in games like
                    <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> or <em>F1 2023</em> and far better
                    bandwidth for multitasking thanks to the new Zen 5
                    architecture.

                    All those gaming-centric CPUs should be arriving in July
                    this year. There’s good news for anybody with the
                    motherboard supporting the AM5 socket. AMD promises to
                    support AM5 through 2027, so if you’re considering
                    upgrading, you’ll have a chance in the next few years. After
                    over eight years of running, AMD plans to end support for
                    AM4 sometime in or after 2025. Zen 5 will continue to be
                    specific to AM5.

                    The chipmaker said pricing is not set for the series 9000
                    chips, but we should know more closer to release in July.

                    A team of researchers from prominent universities –
                    including SUNY Buffalo, Iowa State, UNC Charlotte, and
                    Purdue – were able to turn an autonomous vehicle (AV)
                    operated on the open sourced Apollo driving platform from
                    Chinese web giant Baidu into a deadly weapon by tricking its
                    multi-sensor fusion system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Extensive experiments based on a real-world AV testbed show
                    that the proposed attack can continuously hide a target
                    vehicle from the perception system of a victim AV using only
                    two small adversarial objects,"

                    the researchers, whose work was published last week in The
                    30th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and
                    Networking.

                    While
                    <a

                    have proven vulnerabilities inherent in AV systems, this
                    particular team expanded on single-sensing modality or
                    camera-LiDAR manipulation, and tricked systems that employ
                    Lidar, camera, and radar together.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new attack leverages mmWave reflection – the signals
                    that provide object detection in such systems – on a smooth
                    metal surface. They do this in a way researchers refer to as
                    "low cost" and "easily fabricated" as it involves
                    strategically arranging metal foil and colored patches on
                    cardboard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "By placing a smooth metal surface between the radar and a
                    target vehicle with a specific orientation, the transmitted
                    mmWave signals can be deflected from the radar receiver,
                    leading to a reduction in the energy of echo signals from
                    the vehicle," wrote the study authors. "When the energy
                    becomes lower than a threshold, the target vehicle will be
                    hidden from radar perception."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, the color patch misrepresented input image pixel
                    values and affected Apollo's camera perception. Reflections
                    confused its read on Lidar lasers. Thus all three sensing
                    modalities were compromised.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The [researchers] suggest that the attack could be carried
                    out with drones, which serve to "hide" a secondary vehicle
                    from the victim AV by projecting or carrying the adversarial
                    object. Absent a drone, the trickster collage could be
                    mounted on the front vehicle and disguised as an
                    advertisement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Since the drones only hover for a few seconds during the
                    attack and can fly away from the victim AV immediately after
                    the attack, the attack can be performed with high
                    stealthiness and flexibility," noted the researchers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Baidu Apollo platforms were used in the attack, the
                    attack strategy could theoretically be applied to other
                    multi-sensor fusion systems.

                    It was not created to fuel AI applications, but ERA5 has
                    turned out to be incredibly useful for this purpose.
                    Computer scientists only really got serious about using this
                    data to train AI models to forecast the weather in 2022.
                    Since then, the technology has made rapid strides. In some
                    cases, the output of these models is already superior to
                    global weather models that scientists have labored decades
                    to design and build, and they require some of the most
                    powerful supercomputers in the world to run.

                    the future of weather forecasting," said Matthew Chantry,
                    who leads AI forecasting efforts at the European weather

                    John Dean and Kai Marshland met as undergraduates at
                    Stanford University in the late 2010s. Dean, an electrical
                    engineer, interned at SpaceX during the summer of 2017.
                    Marshland, a computer scientist, interned at the launch
                    company the next summer. Both graduated in 2019 and were
                    trying to figure out what to do with their lives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We decided we wanted to solve the problem of weather
                    uncertainty," Marshland said, so they co-founded a company
                    called WindBorne Systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Dean and Marshland set about designing small weather
                    balloons they could release into the atmosphere and which
                    would fly around the world for up to 40 days, relaying
                    useful atmospheric data that could be packaged and sold to
                    large, government-funded weather models.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Weather balloons provide invaluable data about atmospheric
                    conditions—readings such as temperature, dewpoints, and
                    pressures—that cannot be captured by surface observations or
                    satellites. Such atmospheric "profiles" are helpful in
                    setting the initial conditions models start with. Such
                    atmospheric "profiles" are helpful in setting the initial
                    conditions models start with. The problem is that
                    traditional weather balloons are cumbersome and only operate
                    for a few hours. Because of this, the National Weather
                    Service only launches them twice daily from about 100
                    locations [weather.gov] in the United States.

                    trusting of advice from machines than their own flesh and

                    An international research team has now found it's not just
                    in fiction. In a study involving 111 kids aged between 3 and
                    6 years old, the youngsters showed a preference for
                    believing robots more and being more accepting when robots
                    made mistakes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] The kids were split up into different groups and
                    shown videos of robots and humans labeling objects – some
                    objects the children would already recognize, as well as new
                    objects they wouldn't know the names of.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Human and robot reliability was demonstrated by giving
                    familiar objects incorrect name, calling a plate a spoon for
                    example. In this way the researchers could manipulate the
                    children's sense of who to trust.

                  <p>

                    reliable, the youngsters were more likely to want to

                    the names of new objects and accept their labels as
                    accurate. What's more, the children were more likely to
                    favor robots when asked about who they would share secrets
                    with, who they would want to be friends with, and who they
                    would want to

                    "Children's conceptualizations of the agents making a
                    mistake also differed, such that an unreliable human was
                    selected as doing things on purpose, but not an unreliable
                    robot,"

                    "These findings suggest that children's perceptions of a
                    robot's reliability are separate from their evaluation of
                    its desirability as a social interaction partner and its

                    The study provides support for agri-environmental measures
                    (AEM)—environmentally friendly agricultural practices such
                    as using flowering plants in field margins. AEM can be an
                    effective way to increase farmland biodiversity and mitigate
                    the negative impact of land consolidation. They have been
                    widely implemented in Europe but are hardly used in China.

                    [...] Dr. Jenny Hodgson, a co-author from the University of
                    Liverpool, says, "This study is noteworthy because of the
                    quality of its data and the breadth of influential factors
                    we were able to investigate. It has been really interesting
                    to disentangle the effects of farmland consolidation, of
                    pesticide application and of seminatural habitat beyond the
                    farm."

                  <p>
                    The team also acknowledges that biodiversity is not a
                    farmer's only concern.

                    postdoctoral researcher at Peking University and lead author
                    of the study, says, "The trade-off between biodiversity
                    improvements with labor efficiency, yield and pest control
                    is a balance that has to be finely tuned to ensure maximum
                    profitability, and these factors will always need to be
                    considered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "While we did not observe a direct correlation between the
                    increase in the number of rice pests and the reduction of
                    their natural enemies due to land consolidation, further
                    investigation into the effectiveness of natural enemies in
                    biological pest control is necessary before implementing AEM
                    strategies."

                  <p>
                    The researchers also found no decrease in rice yield in
                    traditional fields compared to consolidated farmland.

                The plight, in this case, is that Indonesia's Administration, in
                the name of public accessibility and user friendliness, has
                created an estimated 27,000 apps for hapless Indonesians to
                "navigate" their (supposedly public) services. One department --
                probably the smallest -- has created 500 of the gleaming
                critters. It is only a guess how many of these are only
                (somewhat) accessible through smart phones, require a crap ton
                of captchas to solve, an electronic identity card, a special
                reader for that electronic identity card, a scan of your birth
                certificate, a digital signature on that scan, details of your
                last family status including the full and spelling correct names
                of all family members to the third degree separation, and the

                    Ottawa wants the power to create secret backdoors in our

                    A federal cybersecurity bill, slated to advance through
                    Parliament soon, contains secretive, encryption-breaking
                    powers that the government has been loath to talk about. And
                    they threaten the online security of everyone in Canada.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bill C-26 empowers government officials to secretly order
                    telecommunications companies to install backdoors inside
                    encrypted elements in Canada's networks. This could include
                    requiring telcos to alter the 5G encryption standards that
                    protect mobile communications to facilitate government
                    surveillance.

                    But with so many other issues facing dairy farmers, geese
                    didn't register. "One thing you learn in agriculture is that
                    Mother Nature is unpredictable and can be devastating,"
                    Turley said. "Just when you think you have figured it out,
                    Mother Nature tells you you do not."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One dairy tried to wall itself off, careful not to share
                    equipment with or employ the same workers as other farms,
                    Turley recalled. Its cattle still became ill. Turley noted
                    that the farm was downwind of another with an outbreak, "so
                    you almost think it has to have an airborne factor."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On March 7, Turley called the Texas Animal Health
                    Commission. They convened a One Health group with experts in
                    animal health, human health, and agriculture to ponder what
                    they called the "mystery syndrome." State veterinarians
                    probed cow tissue for parasites, examined the animals'
                    blood, and tested for viruses and bacteria. But nothing
                    explained the sickness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They didn't probe for H5N1. While it has jumped into mammals
                    dozens of times, it rarely has spread between species. Most
                    cases have been in carnivores, which likely ate infected
                    birds. Cows are mainly vegetarian.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If someone told me about a milk drop in cows, I wouldn't
                    think to test for H5N1 because, no, cattle don't get that,"
                    said Thomas Peacock, a virologist at the Pirbright Institute
                    of England who studies avian influenza.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Postmortem tests of grackles, blackbirds, and other birds
                    found dead on dairy farms detected H5N1, but that didn't
                    turn the tide. "We didn't think much of it since we have
                    seen H5N1-positive birds everywhere in the country," said
                    Amy Swinford, director of the Texas A&amp;M Veterinary
                    Medical Diagnostic Laboratory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the meantime, rumors swirled about a rash of illness
                    among workers at dairy farms in the panhandle. It was flu
                    season, however, and hospitals weren't reporting anything
                    out of the ordinary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bethany Boggess Alcauter, director of research at the
                    National Center for Farmworker Health, has worked in the
                    panhandle and suspected farmworkers were unlikely to see a
                    doctor even if they needed one. Clinics are far from where
                    they live, she said, and many don't speak English or
                    Spanish—for instance, they may speak Indigenous languages
                    such as Mixtec, which is common in parts of Mexico.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cost of medical care is another deterrent, along with
                    losing pay by missing work—or losing their jobs—if they
                    don't show up. "Even when medical care is there," she said,
                    "it's a challenge."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What finally tipped off veterinarians? A few farm cats died
                    suddenly and tested positive for H5N1. Swinford's
                    group—collaborating with veterinary labs at Iowa State and
                    Cornell universities—searched for the virus in samples drawn
                    from sick cows.

                    The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given Amazon
                    permission to fly its delivery drones beyond visual line of
                    sight (BVLOS). With that hurdle cleared, the company claims
                    it can fly farther and expand drone service, providing
                    customers faster delivery and a larger selection of items,

                    in a blog post.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Until now, the FAA has only allowed Amazon to fly drones as
                    far as someone could see them from the ground. That way,
                    spotters or pilots could ensure that drones weren't
                    interfering with aircraft. However, the constraint seriously
                    limited how far the drones could travel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To move beyond that, Amazon said it spent years developing
                    "onboard detect-and-avoid technology." It submitted
                    engineering information to the FAA including operation,
                    maintenance and performance details. Flight tests were then
                    conducted in the presence of FAA inspectors around
                    airplanes, helicopters and a hot air balloon to "demonstrate
                    how the drone safely navigated away from each one of them,"
                    Amazon said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With BVLOS approval in hand, the company plans to expand its
                    delivery area around its drone facility at College Station,
                    Texas. Later in 2024, drone deliveries will be integrated
                    into its broader delivery network.

                    At the same time, traits detrimental to the everyday lives
                    of pet dogs may be valuable to working dogs or dogs used in
                    dog sports. For example, impulsiveness can be useful in dog
                    sports or work-related tasks where fast reactions and
                    excitability can be assets, while independence (as opposed
                    to reliance on humans) may be a valuable trait in scent
                    work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results will help to better identify the kinds of traits
                    in dogs that facilitate everyday life with them, improving
                    the welfare of both owner and dog. "In an earlier study, we
                    observed differences between breeds and sex in different
                    test sections, and these results can together help in
                    choosing a suitable individual puppy," Tiira says.

                    [...] "This is the first test package available to all dog
                    owners in which a connection to the dog's trainability and
                    also to the rate of learning has been observed. Thanks to
                    the smartDOG test already being available, Finnish dog
                    owners can directly make use of the research findings. This
                    research dataset of more than 6,000 dogs is continuously
                    growing, and next we will investigate how early these traits
                    can be seen in puppies, as well as their heritability,"
                    Tiira sums up.

                    OpenAI has revealed operations linked to Russia, China, Iran
                    and Israel have been using its artificial intelligence tools
                    to create and spread disinformation, as technology becomes a
                    powerful weapon in information warfare in an election-heavy
                    year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The San Francisco-based maker of the ChatGPT chatbot said in
                    a report on Thursday that five covert influence operations
                    had used its AI models to generate text and images at a high
                    volume, with fewer language errors than previously, as well
                    as to generate comments or replies to their own posts.
                    OpenAI's policies prohibit the use of its models to deceive
                    or mislead others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Microsoft-backed OpenAI said it was committed to
                    uncovering such disinformation campaigns and was building
                    its own AI-powered tools to make detection and analysis
                    "more effective." It added its safety systems already made
                    it difficult for the perpetrators to operate, with its
                    models refusing in multiple instances to generate the text
                    or images asked for.

                    Kaspersky has released a new virus removal tool named KVRT
                    for the Linux platform, allowing users to scan their systems
                    and remove malware and other known threats for free.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The security firm notes that despite the common
                    misconception that Linux systems are intrinsically secure
                    from threats, there has been a constant supply of "in the
                    wild" examples that prove otherwise, most recently, the XZ
                    Utils backdoor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kaspersky's new tool isn't a real-time threat protection
                    tool but a standalone scanner that can detect malware,
                    adware, legitimate programs abused for malicious purposes,
                    and other known threats and offers to clean them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Our application can scan system memory, startup
                    objects, boot sectors, and all files in the operating system
                    for known malware. It scans files of all formats — including
                    archived ones," says Kaspersky.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One thing to note is that KVRT only supports 64-bit systems
                    and requires an active internet connection to work.

                    Monday with six planets appearing in alignment.

                    and Uranus will take part in the parade – which occurs when
                    planets gather on the same side of the sun.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prof Danny Steeghs, of the University of Warwick said the
                    event, which should be visible around the world, was due to
                    occur around sunrise and would be rather low in the east,
                    meaning the alignment would need some equipment to see
                    properly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Uranus and Neptune will be faint, so viewers will require
                    good binoculars to see them," he said, adding that the

                    and Mercury to the sun would restrict their view.

                    The animals are the first transgenic echinoderms, the phylum
                    that includes starfish, sea cucumbers and other marine
                    animals. Hamdoun's mission is to make genetically modified
                    urchins available to researchers anywhere, not just those
                    who happen to work in research facilities at the edge of the
                    Pacific Ocean.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The lab's breakthrough, and its focus on making the
                    animals freely available to fellow scientists, will "allow
                    us to explore how evolution has solved a lot of really
                    complicated life problems," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers tend to study mice, flies and the like not
                    because the animals' biology is best suited to answer their
                    questions but because "all the tools that were necessary to
                    get at your questions were built up in just a few species,"
                    said Deirdre Lyons, an associate professor of biology at
                    Scripps who worked with Hamdoun on early research related to
                    the project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Expanding the range of animals available for sophisticated
                    lab work is like adding colors to an artist's palette, Lyons
                    said, "Now you can go get the color that you really want,
                    that best fits your vision, rather than being stuck with a
                    few models."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Hamdoun vividly recalls the time he spent earlier in
                    his career trying to track down random snippets of DNA
                    necessary for his research, the disappointment and
                    frustration of writing to professors and former postdocs
                    only to find that the material had long been lost. He'd
                    rather future generations of scientists spend their time on
                    discovery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Biology is really interesting," he said. "The more people
                    can get access to it, the more we're going to learn."

                    from Sony's internal Game &amp; Network Services business
                    reports, the PS5 has raked in $106 billion in sales since
                    launching in November 2020. That's quite the figure for a
                    console that's 'only' been on the market for around three
                    and a half years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, several aspects require clarification. That $106
                    billion doesn't just account for PS5 hardware and software
                    sales – it covers Sony's entire gaming business during the
                    current generation: PS4 sales, older game releases,
                    subscriptions, the works. It's the total pie, not just the
                    PS5 slice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the numbers are impressive when you consider the PS4
                    generation 'only' pulled in $107 billion across its entire
                    seven-year run from 2013 to 2019. With the PS5 closing in on
                    that total revenue after just four years, it's clearly on
                    track to become Sony's biggest console cash cow ever.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The secret sauce seems to be players spending more cash on
                    the PS5 ecosystem as a whole. While the PS4 outsold its
                    successor by a massive 117 million to 56 million units, the
                    higher PS5 price tag combined with increased spending on
                    DLC, microtransactions, services, and accessories is giving
                    Sony a bigger bang for its buck.
                  </p>

                <div>

                    [...] While the researchers have analyzed attacks on home
                    and small office routers before, they said two things make
                    this latest one stand out. They explained:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, this campaign resulted in a hardware-based
                    replacement of the affected devices, which likely indicates
                    that the attacker corrupted the firmware on specific models.
                    The event was unprecedented due to the number of units
                    affected—no attack that we can recall has required the
                    replacement of over 600,000 devices. In addition, this type
                    of attack has only ever happened once before, with AcidRain
                    used as a precursor to an active military invasion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second unique aspect is that this campaign was confined
                    to a particular ASN. Most previous campaigns we’ve seen
                    target a specific router model or common vulnerability and
                    have effects across multiple providers’ networks. In this
                    instance, we observed that both Sagemcom and ActionTec
                    devices were impacted at the same time, both within the same
                    provider’s network.This led us to assess it was not the
                    result of a faulty firmware update by a single manufacturer,
                    which would normally be confined to one device model or
                    models from a given company. Our analysis of the Censys data
                    shows the impact was only for the two in question. This
                    combination of factors led us to conclude the event was
                    likely a deliberate action taken by an unattributed
                    malicious cyber actor, even if we were not able to recover
                    the destructive module.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With no clear idea how the routers came to be infected, the
                    researchers can only offer the usual generic advice for
                    keeping such devices free of malware. That includes
                    installing security updates, replacing default passwords
                    with strong ones, and regular rebooting. ISPs and other
                    organizations that manage routers should follow additional
                    advice for securing the management interfaces for
                    administering the devices.

                    The CEO of South Korean chemical firm SKC made a big bet on
                    the US CHIPS Act when he decided to grow his manufacturing
                    site in the American South. That gamble has now paid off
                    with some CHIPS change coming SKC's way to help bankroll its
                    factory expansion.

                    Thursday it is awarding $75 million from the CHIPS Act
                    subsidy pool to SKC subsidiary Absolics to support the
                    construction of additional facilities in Covington, Georgia.
                    Those facilities will be focused on the development and
                    production of glass semiconductor substrates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the department, it's the first CHIPS Act
                    investment in a commercial facility to manufacture new
                    advanced materials for the semiconductor industry – that
                    material being glass substrates. The $53 billion CHIPS
                    funding pool was created by the White House and Congress to
                    boost the development and manufacturing of semiconductors on
                    US soil to help the country wean itself off foreign
                    suppliers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "An important part of the success of [the] CHIPS program is
                    ensuring the United States is a global leader in every part
                    of the semiconductor supply chain," said Commerce Secretary
                    Gina Raimondo. "The advanced semiconductor packaging
                    technologies Absolics is working on will help to achieve
                    that goal."

                    are the future of multi-die processor packages, and that's
                    perhaps a big reason why Absolics is investing in them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Absolics' parent is a subsidiary of the South Korean
                    mega-chaebol SK Group, which includes among its other
                    subsidiaries chip giant SK hynix. Having an in-house maker
                    of cutting-edge substrates makes perfect sense given the SK
                    umbrella.

                    an expansion of the company's decades-old Covington plant
                    for glass semiconductor work. SK pledged it would spend $240
                    million on a 120,000-square-foot Absolics facility to
                    manufacture glass substrates, which Park predicted "will be
                    the key material in the high-performance computing industry"
                    in the coming years. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2022 Park said glass substrates made in the US would
                    largely be shipped to Asia for semiconductor manufacturing,
                    with some surely ending up at SK hynix. The reason for
                    making them in America, he said, was because US semi
                    manufacturing was booming [...] and a local glass substrate
                    plant would be well-positioned to benefit from demand for
                    the material.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now the biz has applied for and bagged $75 million in direct
                    funding from the US government to support that Absolics
                    factory.
