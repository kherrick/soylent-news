                    Nvidia's melting 12VHPWR power connectors are still out
                    there, although a wave of media coverage last year has
                    increased awareness of the dangers posed by improper contact
                    or bending the power cables too much to make them fit inside
                    compact PC cases. Fortunately, Team Green has been quietly
                    replacing the power connector on newly-manufactured RTX 40
                    series graphics cards, so those of you who have yet to
                    upgrade will have a lower chance of encountering the
                    problematic 12VHPWR design.

                    that the PCI-SIG had developed a new and improved
                    specification for the controversial 16-pin power connector
                    known as 12VHPWR, which has been a major source of headaches
                    for owners of Nvidia's higher-end RTX graphics cards. AMD
                    has yet to adopt the standard, so it has largely avoided
                    criticism in this area, with reviewers mostly lamenting

                    That's good news for RTX 40 series users, some of whom have
                    seen their connectors melt from not making proper contact.
                    Those who were lucky enough to avoid that would sometimes
                    find their cards did not perform at their best even though
                    the power plug appeared to be fully inserted into the card's
                    connector.

                        French police should be able to spy on suspects by
                        remotely activating the camera, microphone and GPS of
                        their phones and other devices, lawmakers agreed late on
                        Wednesday, July 5.

                        Covering laptops, cars and other connected objects as
                        well as phones, the measure would allow the geolocation
                        of suspects in crimes punishable by at least five years'
                        jail. Devices could also be remotely activated to record
                        sound and images of people suspected of terror offenses,
                        as well as delinquency and organized crime.

                      <p>
                        During a debate on Wednesday, MPs in President Emmanuel
                        Macron's camp inserted an amendment limiting the use of
                        remote spying to "when justified by the nature and
                        seriousness of the crime" and "for a strictly
                        proportional duration." Any use of the provision must be
                        approved by a judge, while the total duration of the
                        surveillance cannot exceed six months. And sensitive
                        professions including doctors, journalists, lawyers,
                        judges and MPs would not be legitimate targets.

                    are many issues on the road, but it's a good start and it
                    shows that it's definitely not impossible to get Wayland
                    running on OpenBSD.

                    One of the problems with trying to assess Wayland is that
                    the people writing and talking about it are developers. It's
                    a piece of software that, if it does its job correctly, the
                    user sitting in front of a computer might never know they
                    were using it.

                >, and how more and more companies, including Sparkfun, Arduino
                and Prusa, are becoming more and more proprietary and closed
                source. In Arduino's case, they are deliberately trying to stamp
                out the clones undercutting them. The new Arduino Pro is not
                open source in any way, and the web site has now removed
                references to being an open source company. This is indeed sad
                news and I'm not sure how this will impact the vibrant maker
                community.
              </p>
              <p>
                As always there are subtleties and nuances. In the case of
                Prusa, not only are Chinese companies taking Prusa designs and
                source to make proprietary, closed-source products, they are
                also actively patenting designs and algorithms they've taken
                from open source, freezing out the companies and developers that
                made it all possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                With Red Hat moving to be a proprietary software company (which
                happens to use and work on open source projects) and now these
                reports, what are soylenters' thoughts on the future of open
                source companies and economics? Are truly open source companies
                doomed to failure, especially when overseas companies do not
                respect or even understand the principles of open source
                development? To me this reinforces the importance of the GPLv3,
                not that that stops dishonest companies.

                    Curbside recycling can compensate for the greenhouse gas
                    emissions from garbage destined for landfills, says a new
                    study that encourages towns and cities to continue offering
                    recycling services to meet their climate goals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study's authors took a deep dive into the economic and
                    environmental value of community recycling efforts and
                    compared it to the value of other climate change mitigation
                    practices. They concluded that recycling provides a return
                    on investment similar to or better than environmentally
                    friendly strategies like transitioning to electric vehicles
                    or purchasing green power, which is electricity from clean,
                    renewable energy sources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Towns and cities across the country have canceled or
                    scaled back recycling programs due to rising costs. Recent
                    restrictions on recyclable material collected by major
                    international markets have contributed to the cost increase,
                    according to the study, which was published today in Nature
                    Sustainability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When recycling markets were most lucrative in 2011,
                    U.S. recycling costs were as little as $3 a year per
                    household. Beginning in 2018 and through 2020, tighter
                    restrictions went into place and the COVID-19 pandemic
                    disrupted the markets, and the cost for recycling ranged
                    from $34 to $42. The study asserts that even with higher
                    costs, the investment offsets the greenhouse gas emissions
                    from non-recycled waste buried in landfills.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Townsend and Anshassi say that if local governments
                    restructure their curbside recycling programs to target
                    materials with the greatest market value and the highest
                    potential for carbon offset, recycling can pay for itself
                    and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They identify
                    higher-value materials as newspaper, cardboard, aluminum and
                    steel cans, and HDPE and PET plastic bottles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Researchers also suggest that local and state
                    governments could implement policies to help relieve the
                    cost burden of recycling, like establishing a minimum amount
                    of recyclable materials that manufacturers must use in
                    packaging or products and placing some of the responsibility
                    for recycling costs on the manufacturers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If we learn collectively to recycle better, we can reduce
                    the costs to pretty much break even," Townsend says. "From
                    an environmental perspective, that's a good return on your
                    investment."

                    publicly release records relating to possible UFO sightings

                    Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, has teamed
                    up with Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican, in leading an
                    effort to force the disclosure of information relating to
                    what the government officially calls "unidentified anomalous
                    phenomena," or UAPs. Their 64-page proposal is modeled after
                    a 1992 U.S. law spelling out the handling of records related

                    Virgin Media, which provides broadband, phone and TV
                    services in the UK, is in hot water with regulators over
                    allegations that the company is making it difficult for
                    customers to cancel their contracts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ofcom announced that it had
                    <a
                      href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/news-centre/2023/virgin-media-investigated-over-difficulties-cancelling-contracts"
                      >opened an investigation</a
                    >
                    into the broadband provider today after receiving a number
                    of similar complaints.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Being able to switch provider easily is an important part
                    of a competitive market," Ofcom said. "Telecoms customers
                    can choose from a wide range of providers, services and
                    packages, and can often save hundreds of pounds by switching
                    to a new deal. This ability for customers to shop around,
                    switch and save is particularly important given the current
                    cost-of-living crisis facing UK households."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ofcom expressed concern at the number of complaints it
                    had received from subscribers who tried to leave but claimed
                    the company made it difficult.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Some struggled to get through to an agent on the phone,"
                    the regulator said. "Some found their call was dropped
                    mid-way through or they were put on hold for long periods.
                    And many said they had to make lengthy and repeated requests
                    to cancel, as their initial instruction was not actioned."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "If Ofcom's investigation finds the company in breach
                    of its rules the damage to its reputation is likely to far
                    outweigh any fine. Hopefully when the long-awaited One Touch
                    Switch process is launched later in the year it will mean an
                    end to out-of-contract customers having to announce their
                    intention to leave their current provider before moving to a
                    new one. In the meantime, any Virgin Media customers wanting
                    to cancel should persevere and make sure they don't overpay
                    by staying on a rolling deal."

                    "One Touch Switch" refers to new Ofcom rules designed to

                    Janus was designed to fly to two binary asteroids—consisting
                    of two bodies near one another—that orbit the Sun closer to
                    Earth than the metallic asteroid Psyche. While the Psyche
                    mission can still reach its asteroid destination and
                    accomplish its science mission with a launch this year, the
                    asteroids targeted by Janus will have changed positions in
                    the Solar System by too much since last year. They are no
                    longer accessible to the two Janus spacecraft without flying
                    too far from the Sun for their solar arrays to generate
                    sufficient power.

                    [...] In the end, Janus fell victim to the delay of the
                    Psyche mission and tight budget constraints at NASA. The
                    agency said Tuesday it has directed the Janus team to
                    "prepare the spacecraft for long-term storage."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] NASA's planetary science budget is strained by rising
                    costs on several missions already on the books, including
                    the multibillion-dollar Mars Sample Return project, which is
                    still in an early stage of development. The sample return
                    mission aims to retrieve Martian rock specimens and bring
                    them back to Earth for analysis. The Europa Clipper mission,
                    now undergoing final assembly for launch next year, has also
                    seen cost increases, according to Tom Statler, an official
                    in NASA's planetary science division.

                    The Cooper Davis Act seeks to solve a very real problem: The
                    ease with which drugs can now be purchased online. Back in
                    the day, buying drugs used to be a slog. First, you had to
                    know a guy—typically not a super pleasant or well-groomed
                    one. Then, you had to meet up at said guy's apartment or a
                    street corner, where your plug would dole out the goods. It
                    was an entire ordeal, filled with paranoia and
                    inconvenience. But these days, buying drugs is a lot
                    simpler. In fact, to hear federal officials tell it, buying
                    narcotics is currently about as easy as DoorDashing a
                    burrito. That's because drug sales on social media platforms
                    have exploded, creating a streamlined drug-buying experience
                    that puts an entire black market at young people's
                    fingertips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The negative impacts of this trend are obvious: reporting
                    shows that powerful opioids are being pushed into the hands
                    of young people through platforms like Facebook, Instagram,
                    and Snapchat. Young people will seek out prescription
                    medications—stuff like Xanax, Oxycontin, and Vicodin—only to
                    be sold counterfeit pills that have secretly been laced with
                    fentanyl or meth (this is done because of the narcotics'
                    cheapness and addictiveness). Teenagers looking to score
                    will then be delivered fatally powerful drugs, which end up
                    killing them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an attempt to solve this dizzying drug crisis, the Cooper
                    Davis Act has proposed a radical strategy: according to the
                    most recent version of the bill text, which was shared with
                    Gizmodo by the ACLU, the law would require "electronic
                    communication service providers and remote computing
                    services" to report to the U.S. Attorney General any
                    evidence they discover of "the unlawful sale and
                    distribution of counterfeit substances and certain
                    controlled substances." What this means is that large tech
                    companies—everything from social media giants like
                    Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat to cloud computing or
                    email providers—would be legally required to report certain
                    types of drug activity (basically anything having to do with
                    fentanyl, meth, and counterfeit prescription medications) to
                    the federal government if the company became aware of the
                    drugs being bought or sold on their platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That might theoretically sound like a good idea but the big
                    question is: how, exactly, are platforms supposed to figure
                    out who is a drug dealer and who isn't? That part isn't made
                    clear by the legislation. What is clear is that, under the
                    new law, platforms would be required to surrender large
                    quantities of user data to the government if they suspected
                    a particular user of wrongdoing. That data would be packaged
                    into a report and sent to the DEA and would include...

                        information (excluding personally identifiable
                        information), screen names or monikers for the account
                        used or any other accounts associated with the
                        individual, or any other identifying information,
                        including self-reported identifying information...

                  <p>
                    Additionally, platforms would also have the discretion to
                    share even more data with the government if they felt
                    like—including private communications like DMs and emails.
                    Meanwhile, companies that failed to report evidence of drug
                    offenses could face steep fines. A first failure to report
                    drug activity could result in fines of up to $190,000 per
                    violation, while each additional offense after that could
                    see fines of up to $380,000 per violation.

                    [...] Companies looking for a roadmap would likely end up
                    turning to another federal policy known as 2258A. Venzke
                    says that the Cooper Davis Act is actually modeled off of
                    2258A and that it uses similar policy and language. This
                    longstanding law requires web companies to report child
                    sexual abuse material to the federal government if the
                    companies become aware of it on their platforms. Under this
                    regulation, web platforms are obligated to report suspected
                    child abuse material to the CyberTipline of the National
                    Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a federally
                    funded nonprofit established by Congress to combat child
                    abuse. NCMEC, in turn, forwards the reports it receives to
                    relevant law enforcement agencies for further investigation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the years, companies like Facebook, Apple, and Google
                    have addressed 2258A's reporting requirements by developing
                    a sophisticated surveillance system designed to detect abuse
                    material when it's uploaded to their sites; the system
                    leverages a database of cryptographic hashes, each of which
                    represents a known child abuse image or video. Companies
                    then scan user accounts for matches to these hashes and,
                    when they get a positive hit, they forward the user's
                    relevant data to NCMEC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, when it comes to online drug activity, things are
                    decidedly more complicated. Unlike the problem of CSAM—in
                    which a database of known prohibited material can be
                    compiled and scanned against—it's far from clear how
                    companies would reliably identify and report suspected drug
                    activity. Online drug transactions are largely carried out
                    under the cover of coded language, using oblique terms and
                    signals. How are companies supposed to sift through all that
                    without driving themselves (and their users) insane?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If platforms are actively monitoring for fentanyl [sales],
                    they're going to have to look for a lot more than images and
                    videos," said Venzke. "They're going to have to dig through
                    speech, they're going to have to look at emojis, they're
                    going to have to try to infer user intent." Since the bill
                    does little to stipulate how reporting will be conducted, it
                    will be up to the companies to figure out how to do all
                    this. This could easily lead platforms to build their own
                    internal surveillance systems, the likes of which are
                    designed to monitor how platform users interact in an effort
                    to ferret out drug activity. In this scenario, the
                    likelihood that platforms would end up reporting a lot of
                    "false positives" to the government (i.e., people suspected
                    of drug activity who, in reality, have done nothing wrong)
                    would be high, Venzke says.

                    The end of the NUC is due at least in part to Intel's recent

                    Our universe could be twice as old as current estimates,
                    according to a new study that challenges the dominant
                    cosmological model and sheds new light on the so-called
                    "impossible early galaxy problem."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our newly-devised model stretches the galaxy formation time
                    by a several billion years, making the universe 26.7 billion
                    years old, and not 13.7 as previously estimated," says
                    author Rajendra Gupta, adjunct professor of physics in the
                    Faculty of Science at the University of Ottawa.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For years, astronomers and physicists have calculated the
                    age of our universe by measuring the time elapsed since the
                    Big Bang and by studying the oldest stars based on the
                    redshift of light coming from distant galaxies. In 2021,
                    thanks to new techniques and advances in technology, the age
                    of our universe was thus estimated at 13.797 billion years
                    using the Lambda-CDM concordance model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, many scientists have been puzzled by the existence
                    of stars like the Methuselah that appear to be older than
                    the estimated age of our universe and by the discovery of
                    early galaxies in an advanced state of evolution made
                    possible by the

                      >James Webb Space Telescope</a

                    after the Big Bang, appear to have a level of maturity and
                    mass typically associated with billions of years of cosmic
                    evolution. Furthermore, they're surprisingly small in size,
                    adding another layer of mystery to the equation.

                    A team of researchers has developed new LEDs which emit
                    light simultaneously in two different wavelength ranges, for
                    a simpler and more comprehensive way to monitor the
                    freshness of fruit and vegetables. As the team write in the
                    journal <i>Angewandte Chemie International Edition</i>,
                    modifying the LEDs with perovskite materials causes them to
                    emit in both the near-infrared range and the visible range,
                    a significant development in the contact-free monitoring of
                    food.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perovskite crystals are able to capture and convert light.
                    Being simple to produce and highly efficient, perovskites
                    are already used in solar cells but are also being
                    intensively researched for suitability in other
                    technologies. Angshuman Nag and his team at the Indian
                    Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) in Pune,
                    India, are now proposing a perovskite application in LED
                    technology that could simplify the quality control of fresh
                    fruit and vegetables.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Without light converters, LEDs would emit light in rather
                    narrow light bands. To cover the whole range of white light
                    produced by the sun, the diodes in "phosphor-converted" (pc)
                    LEDs are coated with luminescent substances. Nag and his
                    team have used a double emission coating with the purpose to
                    produce pc-LEDs that emit both white ("normal") light and
                    also a strong band in the near-infrared range (NIR).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To make the dual-emission pc-LED, they applied a double
                    perovskite doped with bismuth and chromium. Part of the
                    bismuth component emits warm white light and another part
                    transfers energy to the chromium component, de-exciting it
                    and causing an additional emission in the NIR range, the
                    researchers found out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NIR is already used in the food industry to examine
                    freshness in fruit and vegetables. Nag and Ph.D. student
                    Sajid Saikia, first author of the paper, explain their idea.
                    "Food contains water, which absorbs the broad near-infrared
                    emission at around 1,000 nm. The more water that is present
                    [due to rotting], the greater the absorption of
                    near-infrared radiation, yielding darker contrast in an
                    image taken under near-infrared radiation. This easy,
                    non-invasive imaging process can estimate the water content
                    in different parts of food, assessing its freshness."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using these modified pc-LEDs to examine apples or
                    strawberries, the team observed dark spots that were not
                    visible in standard camera images. Illuminating the food
                    with both white and NIR light revealed normal coloring that
                    could be seen by the naked eye, as well as those parts which
                    were starting to rot, but not yet visibly so.

                    If viewers sometimes feel guilty about binge-watching
                    television programing, they really shouldn't. Though its
                    name implies impulsive behavior, binge-watching TV is a
                    common activity planned out by viewers, suggests new
                    research from the University of California San Diego's
                    <a href="https://rady.ucsd.edu/"

                  <p>
                    The study, in collaboration with the Tepper School of
                    Business at Carnegie Mellon University and Fox School of
                    Business at Temple University, reveals that viewers prefer
                    to binge-watch certain types of programming over others.
                    They're also more likely to pay to watch shows consecutively
                    and/or wait to be able to consume more than one episode at a
                    time.

                    "We find that the notion of a show being so interesting that
                    it just sucks people in and they can't pull away is not the
                    whole story," said study coauthor Uma Karmarkar, assistant
                    professor of marketing and innovation at UC San Diego's Rady
                    School of Management and School of Global Policy and
                    Strategy. "Binge-watching can have a negative connotation,
                    like binge eating or binge drinking. It is generally seen as
                    impulsive, maybe problematic, but certainly very indulgent.
                    However, media consumption is more complex. Binge-watching
                    is not always about a failure of self-control; it can also
                    be a thoughtful preference and planned behavior."

                    The paper that is forthcoming in "The Journal of
                    Experimental Psychology: Applied" finds that people tend to
                    plan to binge shows they perceive to be more sequential and
                    connected—those that have an overarching narrative. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the authors do find that no matter how bingeable a
                    show is, viewers are much less likely to plan to watch
                    multiple episodes if the streaming service or channel
                    features commercials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But the differences in plans to binge independent and
                    sequential media were also replicated in how people approach
                    streaming media in the form of online education courses. A
                    separate experiment revealed that people are more likely to
                    plan to binge a Coursera class if it is perceived to be more
                    sequential. Taking this one step further, the authors
                    analyzed real-world data from the Coursera platform and
                    found that these plans to binge-learn accurately predicted
                    viewing behavior in enrolled students.

                While “hacking” is often used to mean criminal intrusion into
                computer systems, some, including Bruce Schneier, use a more
                general definition that includes any kind of creative (mis-)use
                of something. While this kind of mindset is often talked about
                in tech circles, it is not restricted to it. The governor of the
                US state of Wisconsin found a

                This essentially changes the time frame of the adjustment from 2
                years (2023–2025) to 402 years (2023&amp;ndash2425). Bruce
                Schneier points out that this is not the first time Wisconsin's
                line-item veto has been used to change a timeframe, and

                to it as: “Definitely a hack. This is not what anyone thinks

                    When Let's Encrypt first launched, we needed to ensure that
                    our certificates were widely trusted. To that end, we
                    arranged to have our intermediate certificates
                    <a
                      href="https://letsencrypt.org/2015/10/19/lets-encrypt-is-trusted.html"
                      >cross-signed by IdenTrust's DST Root CA X3</a
                    >. This meant that all certificates issued by those
                    intermediates would be trusted, even while our own ISRG Root
                    X1 wasn't yet. During subsequent years, our Root X1 became
                    <a
                      href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificate-compatibility/"
                      >widely trusted</a

                    on its own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Come late 2021, our cross-signed intermediates and DST Root
                    CA X3 itself were expiring. And while all up-to-date
                    browsers at that time trusted our root,
                    <a
                      href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet.html"

                    >
                    were still running old versions of the OS which would
                    suddenly stop trusting websites using our certificates. That
                    breakage would have been too widespread, so we arranged for
                    a new cross-sign – this time
                    <a
                      href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/12/21/extending-android-compatibility.html"
                      >directly onto our root</a
                    >
                    rather than our intermediates – which would outlive DST Root
                    CA X3 itself. This stopgap allowed those old Android devices
                    to continue trusting our certificates for three more years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On September 30th, 2024, that cross-sign too will expire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the last three years, the percentage of Android devices
                    which trust our ISRG Root X1 has risen from 66% to 93.9%.
                    That percentage will increase further over the next year,
                    especially as Android releases version 14, which has the
                    ability to
                    <a
                      href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-14-root-certificates-updatable"
                      >update its trust store without a full OS update</a
                    >. In addition, dropping the cross-sign will reduce the
                    number of certificate bytes sent in a TLS handshake by over
                    40%. Finally, it will significantly reduce our operating
                    costs, allowing us to focus our funding on continuing to
                    improve your privacy and security.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For these reasons, we will not be getting a new cross-sign
                    to extend compatibility any further.

                    Zwierlein's group has been studying the behavior of
                    potassium-40 atoms, which are known fermions, that can be
                    prepared in one of two spin states. When a potassium atom of
                    one spin interacts with an atom of another spin, they can
                    form a pair, similar to superconducting electrons. But under
                    normal, room-temperature conditions, the atoms interact in a

                    imagine at first getting big fat holes in your imaging, your
                    atoms running away, nothing is working. We've had terribly
                    complicated problems to solve in the lab through the years,
                    and the students had great stamina, and finally, to be able
                    to see these images was absolutely elating."

                    What the team saw was pairing behavior among the atoms that
                    was predicted by the Hubbard model — a widely held theory
                    believed to hold they key to the behavior of electrons in
                    high-temperature superconductors, materials that exhibit
                    superconductivity at relatively high (though still very
                    cold) temperatures. Predictions of how electrons pair up in
                    these materials have been tested through this model, but
                    never directly observed until now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The pairing behavior between these atoms must also
                    occur in superconducting electrons, and Zwierlein says the
                    team's new snapshots will help to inform scientists'
                    understanding of high-temperature superconductors, and
                    perhaps provide insight into how these materials might be
                    tuned to higher, more practical temperatures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If you normalize our gas of atoms to the density of
                    electrons in a metal, we think this pairing behavior should
                    occur far above room temperature," Zwierlein offers. "That
                    gives a lot of hope and confidence that such pairing
                    phenomena can in principle occur at elevated temperatures,
                    and there's no a priori limit to why there shouldn't be a
                    room-temperature superconductor one day."

                    world's last declared chemical weapons stockpile as soon as
                    tomorrow, July 7th. The US and most other nations agreed to
                    completely eliminate their arsenals within 10 years after
                    the Chemical Weapons Convention took effect in 1997, but the
                    sheer size of the American collection (many of the warheads
                    are several decades old) and the complexity of safe disposal

                    The current method relies on robots that puncture, drain and

                    are then baked to render them harmless. The drained gas is

                    either with bacteria (for mustard gas) or caustic soda (for
                    nerve agents). The remaining liquid is then incinerated.
                    Teams use X-rays to check for leaks before destruction
                    starts, and they remotely monitor robots to minimize contact
                    with hazardous material.

                    [...] The US last used chemical weapons in World War I, but
                    kept producing them for decades as a deterrent. Attention to
                    the program first spiked in 1968, when strange sheep deaths
                    led to revelations that the Army was storing chemical
                    weapons across the US and even testing them in the open.

                    of secretly making nerve gas despite insisting that it
                    destroyed its last chemical weapons in 2017. Pro-government
                    Syrian military forces and ISIS extremists used the weapons
                    throughout much of the 2010s. This won't stop hostile
                    countries and terrorists from using the toxins.

                    Even so, this is a major milestone. In addition to wiping
                    out an entire category of weapons of mass destruction, it
                    represents another step toward reduced lethality in war.

                    Japan's Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has named
                    August 26 as its intended launch date for a lunar lander it
                    hopes will improve humanity's ability to touch down on other
                    worlds – as well as an astronomical observation that might
                    help us understand how they form.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) is also known
                    as the "Moon Sniper" thanks to its use of technologies that
                    JAXA claims "make a qualitative shift towards being able to
                    land where we want and not just where it is easy to land."
                    If JAXA can pull that off, it believes "it will become
                    possible to land on planets even more resource scarce than
                    the Moon."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The sobriquet "sniper" has been applied because the craft is
                    equipped with high-resolution cameras and an image
                    processing algorithm. As it swings into lunar orbit, it will
                    be able to recognize craters and measure its position, then
                    decide on an optimal spot to land. JAXA expects it to touch
                    down within 100 meters of its preferred target.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That accuracy is important, because it means future missions
                    can send instruments to specific locations, instead of
                    having to design missions around the places where landing
                    will be easiest. As the guy said – we do this not because
                    it's easy, but because it's hard.

                    If you're printing something on actual paper, there's a good
                    chance it's important, like a tax form or a job contract.

                    But popular printing products and services won't promise not
                    to read it. In fact, they won't even promise not to share it
                    with outside marketing firms.

                    The spread of digital file-sharing — along with obnoxious
                    business practices by printing manufacturers — has pushed
                    many U.S. households to give up at-home printers and rely on
                    nearby printing services instead. At the same time, major
                    printer manufacturers have adopted mobile apps and
                    cloud-based storage, creating new opportunities to collect
                    personal data from customers. Whether you're walking to the

                    [...] So in a recent paper published in
                    <a
                      href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.201002"
                      ><em>Physical Review Letters</em></a
                    >, Slepian, Hou and Cahn proposed an inventive way to search
                    for evidence that parity was indeed violated during the Big
                    Bang. Their idea was to imagine every possible combination
                    of four galaxies in the night sky. Connect those four
                    galaxies together by imaginary lines, and you have a
                    lopsided pyramid, a tetrahedron. This is the simplest 3D
                    shape possible –and thus the simplest shape that has a
                    mirror image, the key test for parity symmetry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their method required analyzing a trillion possible
                    tetrahedrons for each of a million galaxies, an incredible
                    number of combinations. "Eventually we realized we needed
                    new math," Slepian said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Slepian's group discovered that, indeed, the universe
                    imprinted an early preference for left- or right-handed
                    stuff onto the material that eventually became today's
                    galaxies. (The complex math makes it difficult to say
                    whether that preference was for right-handedness or
                    left-handedness, though.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Since parity violation can only be imprinted on the
                    universe during inflation, if what we found is true, it
                    provides smoking-gun evidence for inflation," Slepian said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings by Slepian's lab can't yet explain how the laws
                    of physics changed, which will require new theories going
                    beyond the Standard Model, a theory that explains our
                    current universe. Now the race is on for scientists to
                    produce this theory that can explain the universe's ancient
                    handedness and the abundance of matter we see today.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    [...] How are we supposed to judge the value of large
                    scientific projects? With traditional projects the
                    cost-benefit analysis is rather straightforward. We sink in
                    a bunch of time and money into a project, and we judge the
                    success of those projects based on how much money they make
                    or how many benefits they provide to society.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But by their very nature large scientific projects don't
                    return any money on the investment. And they don't have any
                    immediate impact on society. So are they really worth it?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The first benefit that large scientific projects have
                    is that they provide a training ground for highly skilled
                    workers. The vast majority of the people working in large
                    collaborations are temporary researchers, hired right out of
                    grad school for a limited period of time to accomplish the
                    goals of the collaboration. Once the project is over those
                    people move on to other things, and since there are
                    essentially no jobs in academia most of those people go into
                    industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Secondly, many corporations are involved in the
                    process of assisting scientific goals. They may make
                    instruments or optics or specialized sensors, for example.
                    Those industries get paid to do their work and they develop
                    new technological solutions that can then be applied to
                    other problems or spun off into their own revenue generating
                    products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When it comes to satisfaction, we are all ultimately human.
                    Part of what makes us human is our innate curiosity about
                    the world around us. Science satisfies that curiosity in an
                    enormous way. Science makes the results of its research
                    available for public consumption. What we learn in science
                    is available and open to all. We enjoy the fruits of
                    scientific labor the same way we enjoy the work of artists
                    and musicians. It is something that touches all of us and
                    impacts all of us.

                    Accounting standards don't properly reflect the difference
                    between losses driven by investments and actual business
                    performance shortfalls, according to new University at
                    Buffalo School of Management research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Forthcoming in the Review of Accounting Studies, the study
                    found that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
                    mask the true value of companies by marking investments in
                    intangibles like technology, brands and human capital as
                    losses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Even as the economy boomed in 2019 following a decade of
                    growth, about half of all public companies reported losses
                    because accounting rules force them to report losses despite
                    initial success," says Feng Gu, Ph.D., chair and professor
                    of accounting and law in the UB School of Management. "This
                    is just another indication of how broken accounting is. We
                    need to treat intangible investments as real economic
                    assets."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "GAAP losers are less likely to decline, more likely
                    to reverse their losses, and even have better future stock
                    performance than real losers or profitable firms," says Gu.
                    "This is an alarming consequence for a group of highly
                    dynamic and innovative firms that are the driving force
                    behind the growing intangible revolution in our economy."

                  <p>
                    Researchers at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science
                    (CEMS) in Japan have discovered a compound that uses a
                    chemical reaction to store ammonia, potentially offering a
                    safer and easier way to store this important chemical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This discovery, published in the
                    <i>Journal of the American Chemical Society</i> on July 10,
                    makes it possible not only to safely and conveniently store
                    ammonia, but also the important hydrogen is [sic] carries.
                    This finding should help lead the way to a decarbonized
                    society with a practical hydrogen economy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For society to make the switch from carbon-based to
                    hydrogen-based energy, we need a safe way to store and
                    transport hydrogen, which by itself is highly combustible.
                    One way to do this is to store it as part of another
                    molecule and extract it as needed. Ammonia, chemically
                    written as NH<sub>3</sub>, makes a good hydrogen carrier
                    because three hydrogen atoms are packed into each molecule,
                    with almost 20% of ammonia being hydrogen by weight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem, however, is that ammonia is a highly corrosive
                    gas, making it difficult to store and use. Currently,
                    ammonia is generally stored by liquefying it at temperatures
                    well below freezing in pressure-resistant containers. Porous
                    compounds can also store ammonia at room temperature and
                    pressure, but storage capacity is low, and the ammonia
                    cannot always be retrieved easily.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new study reports the discovery of a perovskite, a
                    material with a distinctive repetitive crystal structure,
                    which can easily store ammonia and also allows easy and
                    complete retrieval at relatively low temperatures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research team led by Masuki Kawamoto at RIKEN CEMS
                    focused on the perovskite ethylammonium lead iodide
                    (EAPbI<sub>3</sub>), chemically written as
                    CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>.
                    They found that its one-dimensional columnar structure
                    undergoes a chemical reaction with ammonia at room
                    temperature and pressure, and dynamically transforms into a
                    two-dimensional layered structure called lead iodide
                    hydroxide, or Pb(OH)I.

                collaborative mixes of AI language generation will be appearing,

                    Genolve, a platform for creating professional designs, has
                    just released a major version upgrade which integrates three
                    popular AI text-to-image generators: DALL-E 2, Stability.ai
                    and Midjourney! Just type in a description of the desired
                    image and generate it in seconds for pennies per image.
                    Still, it can be tricky to get exactly what you need and in
                    this blog post you'll learn the tricks and techniques to
                    coax the AI to generate mind-blowing results through prompt
                    engineering. You'll also learn step-by-step how to AI edit

                    A Canadian judge has ordered a farmer to pay more than
                    $CAD82,000 ($92,000) in damages following a legal battle
                    over what the thumbs-up emoji means.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chris Achter, the owner of a farming company in Swift
                    Current, Saskatchewan, had sent a thumbs-up emoji in
                    response to a photograph of a flax-buying contract from a
                    grains buyer in 2021.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Months later, the buyer — which had been doing business with
                    Mr Achter for several years — did not receive the flax as
                    expected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That started a dispute that led to "a far-flung search" to
                    unearth what the thumbs-up emoji means, according to the
                    June court ruling that surfaced in local media this week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The buyer, South West Terminal, argued that the emoji
                    implied acceptance of contractual terms, while Mr Achter
                    said he used it only to indicate that he had received the
                    contract, but not to indicate his agreement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] He [the judge] said: "I am satisfied on the balance of
                    probabilities that Chris okayed or approved the contract
                    just like he had done before except this time he used a
                    thumbs-up emoji."

                    While a few years late compared to many other open-source
                    projects adopting a Code of Conduct, the GCC Steering
                    Committee has now adopted a Code of Conduct "CoC" for this
                    open-source compiler project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Passionate compiler developers and other GCC stakeholders
                    are encouraged to remind themselves to be civil in their
                    discussions and follow other recommendations to foster their
                    community. Jason Merrill of the GCC Steering Committee wrote
                    in their announcement of this CoC:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        "The vast majority of the time, the GCC community is a
                        very civil, cooperative space. On the rare occasions
                        that it isn't, it's helpful to have something to point
                        to to remind people of our expectations. It's also good
                        for newcomers to have something to refer to, for both
                        how they are expected to conduct themselves and how they
                        can expect to be treated.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          More importantly, if there is offensive behavior that
                        isn't corrected immediately, it's important for there to
                        be a way to report that to the project leadership so
                        that we can intervene.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          At this time the CoC is preliminary: the code itself
                        should be considered active, but the CoC committee (and
                        so the reporting and response procedures) are not yet in
                        place."

                    for total area burned, the number of people forced to
                    evacuate their homes and the cost of fighting the blazes,
                    and the fire season is only halfway finished, officials said
                    Thursday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's no understatement to say that the 2023 fire season is
                    and will continue to be record breaking in a number of
                    ways," Michael Norton, director general, Northern Forestry
                    Centre, Canadian Forest Service, said Thursday during a
                    briefing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The fires have burned 8.8 million hectares (27.7
                    million acres) an area about the size of the state of
                    Virginia. This already exceeds the record of 7.6 million
                    hectares (18.7 million acres) set in 1989 and is 11 times
                    the 10-year average experienced by this date.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The final area burned for this season may yet be
                    significantly higher," said Norton. "What we can say with
                    certainty right now is that 2023 is a record-breaking year
                    since at least since 1986 when accurate records started to
                    be kept."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Allen said the fine particles found in fire smoke not only
                    have the ability to penetrate deep into airways, they also
                    can travel long distances meaning they could drift far into
                    the U.S.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There have been reports that fires in Eastern Canada and
                    Quebec are affecting air quality in Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There are about 3,790 provincial firefighters battling
                    the blazes across the country being assisted by Canadian
                    Armed Forces personnel. Another 3,258 firefighters from
                    Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, the U.S., Chile, Costa
                    Rica, Mexico, Spain, Portugal, South Korea and the European
                    Union have travelled to Canada to fight fires.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Norton said the cost of fighting wildfires has steadily
                    grown and is approaching about CDN$1 billion (US$750
                    million) a year.

                    At the time, the NHTSA said it found reasons to investigate

                    may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by

                    India's Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will next week
                    launch Chandrayaan-3, a mission that aims to land on the
                    moon and deploy a rover.

                  <p>
                    ISRO yesterday announced that Chandrayaan-3 had been tucked
                    into its capsule and mated with the (LVM-3) launcher that
                    will take it into space. Liftoff from the Satish Dhawan
                    Space Centre has been scheduled for July 14 at 2:35pm IST
                    (09:05 Friday UTC).

                    The ridiculously economical $74.5 million mission aims to
                    land near Luna's south pole in August. From a ramped
                    compartment, the lander will deploy a 26 kilogram rover
                    outfitted with instruments including an Alpha Particle X-ray
                    Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope
                    (LIBS).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lander contains an accelerometer, Ka-band and laser
                    altimeters, Doppler velocimeter, star sensors, inclinometer,
                    touchdown sensor, and cameras for hazard avoidance and
                    positional knowledge.

                  <p>
                    The lander also boasts several instruments including
                    Chandra's Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) to
                    measure surface thermal properties, Lunar Seismic Activity
                    (ILSA) to measure tremors around the landing site, Radio
                    Anatomy of Moon Bound Hypersensitive ionosphere and
                    Atmosphere (RAMBHA) to study the gas and plasma environment,
                    and a NASA-provided passive Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA)
                    for lunar ranging studies.

                  <p>
                    A propulsion module that carries the rover and lander will
                    stay in a 100km lunar orbit, where it will act as a
                    communication relay satellite, complete with a payload –
                    known as the Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth
                    (SHAPE) – that studies spectral and polarimetric
                    measurements of Earth from roughly 362,000 to 405,000
                    kilometers away.

                    The U.S. ecosystem is riddled with PFAS. And a new study
                    released this week by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
                    revealed that these toxic chemicals are in almost half of
                    the country's tap water.

                    This is the first time a government agency has tested for
                    and compared PFAS found in private and public water supplies
                    throughout the country. 45% of the locations tested positive
                    for PFAS chemicals. This stands for

                    to persist until stricter regulations are put in place

                <div>
                  <p>
                    The Intel 8086 microprocessor (1978) started the x86
                    architecture that continues to this day. In this blog post,
                    I'm focusing on a small part of the chip: the address and
                    data pins that connect the chip to external memory and I/O
                    devices. In many processors, this circuitry is
                    straightforward, but it is complicated in the 8086 for two
                    reasons. First, Intel decided to package the 8086 as a
                    40-pin DIP, which didn't provide enough pins for all the
                    functionality. Instead, the 8086 multiplexes address, data,
                    and status. In other words, a pin can have multiple roles,
                    providing an address bit at one time and a data bit at
                    another time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second complication is that the 8086 has a 20-bit
                    address space (due to its infamous segment registers), while
                    the data bus is 16 bits wide. As will be seen, the "extra"
                    four address bits have more impact than you might expect. To
                    summarize, 16 pins, called AD0-AD15, provide 16 bits of
                    address and data. The four remaining address pins (A16-A19)
                    are multiplexed for use as status pins, providing
                    information about what the processor is doing for use by
                    other parts of the system. You might expect that the 8086
                    would thus have two types of pin circuits, but it turns out
                    that there are four distinct circuits, which I will discuss
                    below.

                    temporary restraining order against the new rules, set to be
                    implemented on July 12th. "We will not stand by and let the
                    harmful impacts of this earnings standard on New York City
                    customers, merchants, and the delivery workers it was

                    The Worker's Justice Project that backed the survey decried
                    the new lawsuit. "This latest legal maneuver to prop up
                    their business model comes at the expense of workers who can
                    barely survive in a city facing a massive affordability
                    crisis," director Ligia Guallpa told the <em>Post</em>.

                  <p>
                    New York became the first US city to mandate a minimum wage
                    for food delivery workers, ordering platforms to pay workers
                    $17.96 per hour, plus tips, by July 12th. The minimum wage
                    in the city is $15 per hour, but the extra amount accounts
                    for the fact that delivery workers are usually paid as
                    contractors, so have higher taxes and must pay work-related
                    expenses out of pocket. According to an estimate from the
                    DCWP (NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection), NYC
                    has more than 60,000 food delivery workers who earn an
                    average of $7.09 per hour.

                    Facepalm: When will people who smuggle hardware into China
                    learn that strapping thousands of dollars of components to
                    your body often leads to arrest? Once again, the country's
                    customs have caught someone trying the same old trick. On
                    this occasion, a trafficker had 420 M.2 SSDs attached to his
                    torso using tape.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The 420 M.2 SSDs are said to be worth around
                    HK$258,000 or $32,984.94. That works out to an average of
                    $78.53 each, so they're likely on the higher end of the
                    quality scale.

                    sneaking tech goods into China for years. In 2015, a man was
                    caught with an impressive 146 iPhones strapped to his body.
                    A woman attempted the same thing a

                    Taping CPUs to one's body is also popular. A pair of men

                      Increased difficulty in mining Bitcoin positively predicts
                      returns. This supports the theory that as blockchain
                      technology requirements increase, bitcoin's supply is
                      reduced, thus increasing its return.

                    <li>
                      Bitcoin returns are positively driven by investor
                      sentiment, indicating the speculative nature of the
                      cryptocurrency as an asset.

                      Higher stress levels or financial turmoil in the economy
                      cause a decrease in future bitcoin returns, underscoring
                      the risks associated with holding bitcoin as an asset.

                  <p>
                    According to the researchers, bitcoin has functioned in
                    three different economic roles over time: as a form of
                    currency, as a speculative security, and as a safe-haven
                    commodity due to its scarcity and mining costs.

                    When compared to the thousands of other programming
                    languages that have been created in the past 60+ years, PL/I
                    was a success. PL/I reportedly was used in the development
                    of the Multics operating system and the S/360 version of
                    Sabre airline reservation system, among others. PL/I was
                    taught at the college-level. PL/I has been around for
                    decades. Most programming languages would be envious to do
                    half as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But PL/I didn't achieve its strategic goal of consolidating
                    scientific and business computing with the best new
                    programming paradigms that research could provide, and it
                    wasn't for a lack of trying. That goal, although
                    well-intentioned, became impossible as both FORTRAN and
                    COBOL kept accelerating. In terms of adoption, COBOL became
                    the most widely used programming language in the world by
                    1970, and ripping out an existing COBOL system and replacing
                    it with PL/I was going to be a hard sell to customers. The
                    same could surely be said of existing FORTRAN systems. COBOL
                    and FORTRAN also kept accelerating in terms of language
                    definition during the 1960s, making PL/I's feature parity
                    with them not just a challenge, but also ambiguous as it
                    took both COBOL and FORTRAN years to stabilize their own
                    respective standards.

                    Caraiani and Newton achieved modularity — for all elliptic
                    curves over about half of all imaginary quadratic fields —
                    by figuring out how to adapt a process for proving
                    modularity pioneered by Wiles and others to elliptic curves
                    over imaginary quadratic fields.

                    [...] The work is a technical achievement in its own right,
                    and it opens the door to making progress on some of the most
                    important questions in math in the imaginary setting.

                    [...] In the late 1950s, Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimura
                    proposed that there is a perfect 1-to-1 matching between
                    certain modular forms and elliptic curves. The next decade
                    Robert Langlands built on this idea in the construction of
                    his

                    If the 1-to-1 correspondence is true, it would give
                    mathematicians a powerful set of tools for understanding the
                    solutions to elliptic curves. For example, there's a kind of
                    numerical value associated with each modular form. One of
                    math's most important open problems (proving it comes with a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium/birch-and-swinnerton-dyer-conjecture/"
                      >million-dollar prize</a
                    >) — the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture — proposes
                    that if that value is zero, then the elliptic curve
                    associated to that modular form has infinitely many rational
                    solutions, and if it's not zero, the elliptic curve has
                    finitely many rational solutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But before anything like that can be tackled, mathematicians
                    need to know that the correspondence holds: Hand me an
                    elliptic curve, and I can hand you its matching modular
                    form. Proving this is what many mathematicians, from Wiles
                    to Caraiani and Newton, have been up to over the last few
                    decades.

                    [...] Their result provides a foundation for investigating
                    some of the same basic questions about elliptic curves over
                    imaginary quadratic fields that mathematicians pursue over
                    the rationals and the reals. This includes the imaginary
                    version of Fermat's Last Theorem — though additional
                    groundwork needs to be laid before that is approachable —
                    and the imaginary version of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
                    conjecture.

                    Android manufacturers tend to love big spec sheets, even if
                    those giant numbers won't do much for day-to-day phone
                    usage. In that vein, we've got the new high-water mark for
                    ridiculous amounts of memory in a phone. The new

                    the most amount of memory ever in an Android phone. Because
                    we're all about big numbers, it also comes with 1TB of
                    storage. [...] This suped-up 24GB version of the phone

                    You definitely want an adequate amount of RAM in an Android
                    phone. All these apps are designed around cheap phones,
                    though, and with Android's aggressive background app
                    management, there's usually not much of a chance to use a
                    ton of RAM. Theoretically, a phone like this would let you
                    multitask better, since apps could stay in memory longer,
                    and you wouldn't have to start them back up when switching
                    tasks. Most people aren't quickly switching through
                    <em>that</em> many apps, though, and some heavy apps, games
                    especially, will just automatically turn off a few seconds
                    once they're in the background.

                    Mandating a simpler cancellation process would confuse
                    consumers and create problems for businesses, trade groups

                    Trade groups representing publishers, advertisers and
                    videogame companies have come out against the Federal Trade
                    Commission's proposed requirement that companies offer
                    consumers an easy click-to-cancel way to get out of
                    subscriptions and memberships.

                    The FTC earlier this year proposed a rule that would require
                    companies to make it as easy for customers to stop recurring
                    charges as it is to sign up to them. That would mean an end
                    to onerous "click to subscribe, call to cancel" routines and
                    other systems designed to introduce friction into the
                    cancellation process.

                    For over a century, scientists have been puzzling over a
                    mysterious, blood-red liquid that's been seeping out of a
                    glacier in Antarctica.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The weird site, later dubbed "Blood Falls," has confounded
                    researchers. But now, a team of researchers at Johns Hopkins
                    may have shed new light on the strange discharge.

                    [...] "As soon as I looked at the microscope images, I
                    noticed that there were these little nanospheres and they
                    were iron-rich, and they have lots of different elements in
                    them besides iron — silicon, calcium, aluminum, sodium — and
                    they all varied," said Ken Livi, a research scientist and
                    coauthor of a
                    <a

                    The existence of these mysterious nanospheres, which haven't
                    been detected until now, runs counter to the prevailing
                    theory that the blood-red liquid was caused by an abundance
                    of minerals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Minerals are crystalline in nature, while these nanospheres,
                    which are 100 times smaller than red blood cells, aren't.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their existence also sheds new light on the microorganisms
                    and bacteria that have lived for "potentially millions of
                    years underneath the saline waters of the Antarctic
                    glacier," according to Livi.

                    The currents of air that wrap around our planet are becoming
                    unrecognizable to climate scientists.

                  <p>
                    The southern part of the jet stream over North America has
                    completely broken apart and is currently trapped in a
                    vicious revolution that has triggered an off-the-chart
                    heatwave.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While it's normal for the air currents to stop, split apart,
                    recombine and flow in opposite directions, on average these
                    tropospheric air streams are typically quite continuous over
                    long distances with an overall west to east flow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The current fragmentation is unlike anything specialists
                    have seen before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Jet streams are known to get 'blocked' on occasion,
                    trapping weather systems in certain regions for days on end.
                    But recent evidence suggests climate change could cause more
                    blockages than usual by slowing down jet streams so they
                    break apart, causing chaotic weather on the ground.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That seems to be what's happening right now in North
                    America, and it's not just climate change that's
                    contributing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mann explains that El Niño has likely exacerbated the
                    situation, too.

                    "I'm honestly at a loss to even characterize the current
                    large-scale planetary wave pattern," he tweeted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even the average layperson can clearly see the differences
                    when comparing a normal pattern of jet streams to what's
                    occurring today.

                    [...] "It is now clear that Earth's climate system is way
                    out of kilter and we should be very concerned," Central
                    Queensland University Environmental Geographist Steve Turton
                    explained for The Conversation.

                    From pole to pole, the winds of change are here. The climate
                    crisis is no longer a future problem. It's happening now,
                    right before our eyes.
