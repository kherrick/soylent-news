                    [...] <br />imagery from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance
                    Orbiter, which flew over the landing site, Intuitive
                    Machines has determined that the lander came down to the
                    surface and likely skidded. This force caused one of its six
                    landing legs to snap. Then, for a couple of seconds, the
                    lander stood upright before toppling over due to the failed
                    leg.<br />[...]<br />"The question is, do you want to limp
                    along and stay alive with everything shut off?" Altemus
                    said. "Or do you want to go on the Quasonix, when you have
                    the big ear listening, and get all the data you can? And
                    that's the decision we made, to go get all the data. It's
                    not how long you stay alive. It's how much information you
                    glean from this mission."<br />[...]<br />In thinking back
                    over the 12 days since the Intuitive Machines lander
                    launched on a Falcon 9 rocket, Altemus said the mission
                    experienced 11 crises. The first of these happened shortly
                    after the Falcon 9 rocket's upper stage released the
                    spacecraft into a translunar injection. The star trackers on
                    board the spacecraft failed.<br />[...]<br />If one assumes
                    there is a 70 percent chance of recovering from any one of
                    these crises but you have to address 11 different crises on
                    the way to the Moon, the probability of mission success is
                    less than 2 percent.

                    "The reason we made it is right here, our people," he said.
                    "The team we had, what they did, oh my God. They never quit.
                    The perseverance, the resilience, just the power of the
                    people we have in this team. That's why we're on the Moon."

                    The secret to making delicious chocolate with less added
                    sugar is oat flour, according to a new study by Penn State
                    researchers. In a blind taste test, recently published in
                    the
                    <a
                      href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/1750-3841.16923"
                      >Journal of Food Science</a
                    >, 25% reduced-sugar chocolates made with oat flour were
                    rated equally, and in some cases preferred, to regular
                    chocolate. The findings provide a new option for decreasing
                    chocolate's sugar content while maintaining its texture and
                    flavor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We were able to show that there is a range in which you can
                    manage a sizable reduction in added sugar and people won't
                    notice and don't care, in terms of liking," said John Hayes,
                    professor of food science at Penn State and corresponding
                    author on the study. "We're never going to make chocolate
                    healthy, because it's an indulgence, but we can successfully
                    take out some of the sugar for consumers who are trying to
                    reduce their intake of added sugars."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hayes explained that chocolate is about half sugar by
                    weight, with the rest being fat and cocoa solids, so
                    reducing the amount of sugar by any amount can drastically
                    alter the texture and flavor profile of the chocolate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The function of sugar in chocolate is both sweetness and
                    bulking, so if we take that sugar out, we have to put
                    something else in that will do the job just as well, or
                    consumers will notice," said Gregory Ziegler, distinguished
                    professor of food science at Penn State and co-author on the
                    study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Our results suggest we can cut back 25% of added
                    sugar to chocolate, effectively reducing the total sugar by
                    13.5%, if we substitute oat flour," said Kai Kai Ma, a
                    doctoral candidate in food science at Penn State and
                    co-author on the paper. "That addition of oat flour is
                    unlikely to meaningfully impact consumer acceptability,
                    which is great news."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "I'm a big believer in meeting consumers where they
                    are," Hayes said. "We've tried for 40 years to tell people
                    to eat less sugar and it doesn't work because people want to
                    eat what they want to eat. So instead of making people feel
                    guilty, we need to meet people where they are and figure out
                    how to make food better while still preserving the pleasure
                    from food."

                    controversy in multiple countries by collecting customers'
                    personal data using an eyeball-scanning "orb."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The AEPD, Spain's data protection regulator, has demanded
                    that Worldcoin immediately ceases collecting personal
                    information in the country via the scans and that it stops
                    using data it has already gathered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The regulator announced on Wednesday that it had taken the
                    "precautionary measure" at the start of the week and had
                    given Worldcoin 72 hours to demonstrate its compliance with
                    the order.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Worldcoin has registered 4 million users, according to
                    a person with knowledge of the matter. Investors poured
                    roughly $250 million into the company, including venture
                    capital groups Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures,
                    internet entrepreneur Reid Hoffman and, prior to the
                    collapse of his FTX empire, Sam Bankman-Fried.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The project attracted media attention and prompted a handful
                    of consumer complaints in Spain as queues began to grow at
                    the stands in shopping centers where Worldcoin is offering
                    cryptocurrency in exchange for eyeball scans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "I want to send a message to young people. I
                    understand that it can be very tempting to get €70 or €80
                    that sorts you out for the weekend," España Martí said, but
                    "giving away personal data in exchange for these derisory
                    amounts of money is a short, medium and long-term risk."

                    Modern Arts is now using Lore Machine to develop a fictional
                    universe for a manga series based on text written by the
                    creator of Netflix's <em>Love, Death &amp; Robots</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under the hood, Lore Machine is built from familiar parts. A
                    large language model scans your text, identifying
                    descriptions of people and places as well as its overall
                    sentiment. A version of Stable Diffusion generates the
                    images. What sets it apart is how easy it is to use. Between
                    uploading my story and downloading its storyboard, I clicked
                    maybe half a dozen times.
                  </p>

                    that hide the stunning power of generative models behind a
                    one-click web interface. "It's a lot of work to stay current
                    with new AI tools, and the interface and workflow for each
                    tool is different," says Ben Palmer, CEO of the New Computer
                    Corporation, a content creation firm. "Using a mega-tool
                    with one consistent UI is very compelling. I feel like this
                    is where the industry will land."

                    Campion set up the company behind Lore Machine two years ago
                    to work on a blockchain version of Wikipedia. But when he
                    saw how people took to generative models, he switched
                    direction. Campion used the free-to-use text-to-image model
                    Midjourney to make a comic-book version of Samuel Taylor
                    Coleridge's <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em>. It
                    went viral, he says, but it was no fun to make.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "My wife hated that project," he says. "I was up to four in
                    the morning, every night, just hammering away, trying to get
                    these images right." The problem was that text-to-image
                    models like Midjourney generate images one by one. That
                    makes it hard to maintain consistency between different
                    images of the same characters. Even locking in a specific
                    style across multiple images can be hard. "I ended up
                    veering toward a trippier, abstract expression," says
                    Campion.

                Linux (and sometimes GNU/Linux) dominates fully in all other
                areas: servers, routers, various embedded devices (cars,
                televisions, lawn mowers, etc), mobile phones, interplanetary
                satellites, and supercomputers. The desktop is the last
                remaining market, albeit a highly symbolic one. As usual, it is
                way too early to speculate about "year of the Linux desktop".
                However, when one can (once again) walk into a big box store and
                buy a GNU/Linux system off the shelf, that market can be
                considered won over.

                    ...<br />When the researchers first did this experiment with
                    American college students as the test subjects, they found
                    that people tended to produce time intervals that are
                    related by simple integer ratios. Furthermore, most of the
                    rhythms they produced, such as those with ratios of 1:1:2
                    and 2:3:3, are commonly found in Western music.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers then went to Bolivia and asked members of
                    the Tsimane' society to perform the same task. They found
                    that Tsimane' also produced rhythms with simple integer
                    ratios, but their preferred ratios were different and
                    appeared to be consistent with those that have been
                    documented in the few existing records of Tsimane' music.

                  <p>
                    "At that point, it provided some evidence that there might
                    be very widespread tendencies to favor these small integer
                    ratios and that there might be some degree of cross-cultural
                    variation. But because we had just looked at this one other
                    culture, it really wasn't clear how this was going to look
                    at a broader scale," Jacoby says.

                    [...] Just as they had in their original 2017 study, the
                    researchers found that in every group they tested, people
                    tended to be biased toward simple integer ratios of rhythm.
                    However, not every group showed the same biases. People from
                    North America and Western Europe, who have likely been
                    exposed to the same kinds of music, were more likely to
                    generate rhythms with the same ratios.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, many groups, for example, those in Turkey, Mali,
                    Bulgaria, and Botswana, showed a bias for other rhythms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There are certain cultures where there are particular
                    rhythms that are prominent in their music, and those end up
                    showing up in the mental representation of rhythm," Jacoby
                    says.

                  <p>
                    The researchers believe their findings reveal a mechanism
                    that the brain uses to aid in the perception and production
                    of music.

                    In the Japanese art of Kintsugi, an artist takes the broken
                    shards of a bowl and fuses them back together with gold to
                    make a final product more beautiful than the original.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That idea is inspiring a new approach to managing plasma,
                    the super-hot state of matter, for use as a power source.
                    Scientists are using the imperfections in magnetic fields
                    that confine a reaction to improve and enhance the plasma in
                    an approach outlined in a paper in the journal Nature
                    Communications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This approach allows you to maintain a high-performance
                    plasma, controlling instabilities in the core and the edge
                    of the plasma simultaneously. That simultaneous control is
                    particularly important and difficult to do. That's what
                    makes this work special," said Joseph Snipes of the U.S.
                    Department of Energy's (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics
                    Laboratory (PPPL). He is PPPL's deputy head of the Tokamak
                    Experimental Science Department and was a co-author of the
                    paper.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    PPPL Physicist Seong-Moo Yang led the research team, which
                    spans various institutions in the U.S. and South Korea. Yang
                    says this is the first time any research team has validated
                    a systematic approach to tailoring magnetic field
                    imperfections to make the plasma suitable for use as a power
                    source. These magnetic field imperfections are known as
                    error fields.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Error fields are typically caused by minuscule defects
                    in the magnetic coils of the device that holds the plasma,
                    which is called a tokamak. Until now, error fields were only
                    seen as a nuisance because even a very small error field
                    could cause a plasma disruption that halts fusion reactions
                    and can damage the walls of a fusion vessel. Consequently,
                    fusion researchers have spent considerable time and effort
                    meticulously finding ways to correct error fields.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This study demonstrates that adjusting the error
                    fields can simultaneously stabilize both the core and the
                    edge of the plasma. By carefully controlling the magnetic
                    fields produced by the tokamak's coils, the researchers
                    could suppress edge instabilities, also known as edge
                    localized modes (ELMs), without causing disruptions or a
                    substantial loss of confinement.

                    Apple – which said it contests the decision – behaved this
                    way for a decade, resulting in "millions of people who have
                    paid two, three euros more per month for their music
                    streaming service than they would otherwise have had to
                    pay," she said.

                    The €1.8 billion fine follows an investigation triggered by
                    a complaint from Swedish streaming service Spotify five
                    years ago. Since then, the EU has drawn up new regulations
                    taking effect this week to prevent tech giants from
                    cornering digital markets.

                    Apple's anti-steering rules have prevented developers from
                    directing users outside the App Store – thereby
                    circumventing Apple's 30 percent commission – for in-app
                    purchases and subscriptions. As part of the EC decision,
                    Apple is being forced to end the use of anti-steering
                    provisions in the bloc, but this restriction applies only to
                    music streaming apps, an EC spokesperson told The Register.

                    Vestager described Apple's anti-competitive conduct as
                    having gone on for nearly a decade, resulting in iOS users
                    paying "significantly higher prices for music streaming
                    subscriptions." The anti-steering provisions also led to a
                    "degraded user experience," Vestager said, as users were
                    forced to "engage in a cumbersome search" to find cheaper
                    prices outside the App Store because the anti-steering rule
                    also prevented developers from telling users about cheaper
                    prices available elsewhere.

                    Apple on Monday was fined 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion)
                    by European Union regulators for thwarting competition among
                    music streaming rivals, a severe punishment levied against
                    the tech giant in a long-simmering battle over the powerful
                    role it plays as gatekeeper of the App Store.

                    The penalty, announced by the E.U. antitrust regulator, is
                    the culmination of a five-year investigation set in motion
                    by one of its biggest rivals, Spotify. Regulators said Apple
                    illegally used its App Store dominance to box out rivals.

                    The European Commission decided to fine the company after
                    finding that its anti-steering rules may have led iOS users
                    to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming
                    subscriptions. Additionally, officials determined the
                    provisions caused "non-monetary harm in the form of a
                    degraded user experience." Because developers can't include
                    a link to external purchase options in their apps, users
                    have to search manually for those purchase options.

                So, in the background, the owners of the PBC have been working
                with staff to get the site moved over to a new legal entity and
                continue operations. This process is moving slowly, but it is
                moving, with the expectation that we should be able to fully
                hand off SN in the next month or so. However, the PBC has burned
                through its cash reserves, and we have an overdue Linode bill as
                is for $268 USD. I could write more, but the tl;dr, without
                money, SN will disappear off the Internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the subscriptions understandably stopped due to the
                uncertainty with site ownership and management. However, we're
                not able to pay the bills with the trickle coming in. At this
                point, everyone involved has agreed with and are working towards
                a solution to move SN to a not-for-profit and 501(c)3, but we do
                need the communities financial support to get there. If we can
                raise $500 USD via subscriptions, direct donations, or other
                means, that would keep the site up past May. As such, if you
                have let your subscription lapse, or otherwise are able to
                support SN, please do so now.

                Any funds raises will be donated to the *new* NFP as soon as it

                our funding goal.

                    A daily fiber supplement improved brain function in people
                    over 60 in just 12 weeks. The study, published recently in
                    Nature Communications by researchers from the School of Life
                    Course &amp; Population Sciences showed that this simple and
                    cheap addition to diet can improve performance in memory
                    tests associated with early signs of Alzheimer's disease.

                  <p>
                    However, the prebiotic supplements inulin and FOS were found
                    to have no effect on muscle strength over this period.

                    "We are excited to see these changes in just 12 weeks. This
                    holds huge promise for enhancing brain health and memory in
                    our aging population. Unlocking the secrets of the gut-brain
                    axis could offer new approaches for living more healthily
                    for longer," says first author Dr. Mary Ni Lochlainn from
                    the Department of Twin Research.

                    As populations age globally, the prevalence of age-related
                    conditions such as cognitive decline and muscle loss is on
                    the rise. Researchers at TwinsUK, the U.K.'s largest adult
                    twin registry based at King's College London, sought to
                    understand how targeting the microbiota, the diverse
                    community of microorganisms residing in our intestines,
                    using two cheap, commercially available plant fiber
                    supplements inulin and FOS, could impact both muscle health
                    and brain function.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers assigned 36 twin pairs—72 individuals—over 60
                    years old to receive either a placebo or the supplement
                    every day for 12 weeks. Neither the analysis team, nor the
                    participants knew which they received until the analysis was
                    complete (double-blind). Alongside this, all study
                    participants did resistance exercises and ate a protein
                    supplement which was aimed at improving muscle function.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers monitored participants remotely via video,
                    online questionnaires and cognitive tests. They found the
                    fiber supplement led to significant changes in the
                    participants' gut microbiome composition, particularly an
                    increase in the numbers of beneficial bacteria such as
                    Bifidobacterium.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While there was no significant difference in muscle strength
                    between the groups, the group receiving the fiber supplement
                    performed better in tests assessing brain function,
                    including the Paired Associates Learning test which is an
                    early marker for Alzheimer's disease, together with tests of
                    reaction time and processing speed. These measures are
                    important for daily living—for example reacting to traffic
                    or stopping a simple trip-up turning into a fall.

                    Humpback whales have been observed having sex for the first
                    time, with this landmark moment having an interesting twist
                    – the two whales were male.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite decades of research on humpback whales, sightings of
                    the male's penis have been rare. Copulation by the species
                    had not been documented by people – until now, when two
                    photographers captured images of a sexual encounter between
                    two whales off the coast of Hawaii.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The sighting, confirmed by scientists in a newly published
                    study, occurred in January 2022 in waters west of the island
                    of Maui, where two whales approached and circled a boat
                    before engaging in sexual activity about three to five
                    meters below the vessel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Both of the whales were male, which makes the photos, taken
                    by Lyle Krannichfeld and Brandi Romano, the first evidence
                    of homosexual behavior in humpback whales as well as the
                    first sighting of sex in the species. Homosexual behavior is
                    common in the animal kingdom and has been spotted among
                    dolphins and orca whales, but never previously between
                    humpback whales.

                    The researchers showed that mechanical stresses induced on a
                    water strider's body were well below safe limits for a
                    strider, as determined by separate experiments in which they
                    compressed a strider's exoskeleton to the point of rupture.
                    These stresses come both from compression forces from the
                    falling drops and from inertial forces induced by
                    acceleration of the water around the point of impact. After
                    submersion, a strider quickly reemerges by using "power
                    strokes" to reach the surface and by grabbing onto floating
                    particles. While submerged, the strider can exploit its
                    plastron—a bubble the insect carries around its hydrophobic
                    body—as a temporary source of air. Thanks to the plastron,
                    striders can survive several minutes of submersion, says
                    Dickerson.

                    Studies at MIT and elsewhere are producing mounting evidence
                    that light flickering and sound clicking at the gamma brain
                    rhythm frequency of 40 Hz can reduce Alzheimer's disease
                    (AD) progression and treat symptoms in human volunteers as
                    well as lab mice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new study in Nature using a mouse model of the disease,
                    researchers at The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory
                    of MIT reveal a key mechanism that may contribute to these
                    beneficial effects: clearance of amyloid proteins, a
                    hallmark of AD pathology, via the brain's glymphatic system,
                    a recently discovered "plumbing" network parallel to the
                    brain's blood vessels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Ever since we published our first results in 2016, people
                    have asked me how does it work? Why 40 Hz? Why not some
                    other frequency?" said study senior author Li-Huei Tsai,
                    Picower Professor of Neuroscience and director of The
                    Picower Institute and MIT's Aging Brain Initiative.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These are indeed very important questions we have worked
                    very hard in the lab to address."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new paper describes a series of experiments, led by
                    Mitch Murdock when he was a Brain and Cognitive Sciences
                    doctoral student at MIT, showing that when sensory gamma
                    stimulation increases 40 Hz power and synchrony in the
                    brains of mice, that prompts a particular type of neuron to
                    release peptides.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study results further suggest that those short protein
                    signals then drive specific processes that promote increased
                    amyloid clearance via the glymphatic system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We do not yet have a linear map of the exact sequence of
                    events that occurs," said Murdock, who was jointly
                    supervised by Tsai and co-author and collaborator Ed Boyden,
                    Y. Eva Tan Professor of Neurotechnology at MIT, a member of
                    the McGovern Institute for Brain Research and an affiliate
                    member of The Picower Institute. "But the findings in our
                    experiments support this clearance pathway through the major
                    glymphatic routes."

                    seemingly endless gray hallways. I shot at a steady trickle
                    of Stormtroopers with one of their own (intentionally)
                    semi-accurate blaster rifles. After a while, I would ask
                    myself a pertinent, era-specific question: Why was I playing
                    this low-energy nostalgia trip instead of actual Doom?<br />[...]<br />Nightdive
                    Studios continues its streak of providing spiffed-up but
                    eminently faithful remasters of classic titles with Dark
                    Forces Remastered. The studio's leaders

                    that their goal was games that "play the way you remember
                    them playing. Not the way they actually did on your 486
                    [computer], but in an evocative manner." For me, Dark Forces
                    Remastered feels far, far better than I remember, and so
                    I've gotten a chance to absorb a lot more of the world it's
                    trying to evoke.<br />[...]<br />The little voice
                    stings—"Stop!" "You're not authorized!"—were a delight, if
                    often cut short by the quick dispatching of their speaker.
                    For the first few levels, I felt like the Rebellion could
                    have destroyed five Death Stars in just two movies if they
                    had a few more Kyles like me. But Dark Forces does ramp up
                    as you go on.

                    All the same cheat codes from the original game
                    work—Nightdive even gives you places to type them in and
                    then activate them in menus—and I had to lean on a couple
                    level skips and resupplies to get through the first seven
                    levels.<br />[...]<br />There are new lighting effects, much
                    nicer menus and options, gamepad support (including rumble),
                    and polished cutscenes, in addition to the gameplay that now
                    tilts a bit more toward Motörhead than Rush in speed and
                    feel. But, really, what sells Dark Forces Remastered is the
                    game beneath the upgrades. If you have any interest in
                    hopping on Jabba the Hutt's barge again, this is the way to
                    do it.

                Nostalgia, guaranteed to cause "irregular heartbeat, fever, and

                I've tried to replay Dark Forces II (the sequel to the game
                mentioned in the article) and the experience was pretty
                terrible. Game design has really advanced since those dark ages
                and you really feel it on most older titles. For another
                example, the nostalgia of Wing Commander is real. However, the
                interface is beyond atrocious.

                    [...] <br />HP will charge subscribers who cancel their
                    subscription before its end date up to $270 plus taxes (the
                    amount decreases to as little as $60, depending on the
                    printer rented and the length of the subscription). After
                    two years, users won't see a cancellation fee if they return
                    the rental printer and ink cartridges within 10 days after
                    canceling their subscription. With these tactics, HP is
                    creating the same type of subscription reliance that has
                    made companies like phone carriers rich while limiting
                    customer options.<br />[...]<br />In the

                    announcing the subscription, Diana Sroka, head of product
                    for consumer services at HP, boasted about how people could
                    "never own a printer again," "say goodbye to your tech
                    troubles," and enjoy "hassle-free printing." The problem is
                    that tech troubles and hassle-filled printing aren't the
                    products of merely owning a printer; they're connected to
                    disruptive and anti-consumer practices from printer
                    vendors.<br />[...]<br />In addition to some HP printers

                    Using a combination of high-speed video, micro-computed
                    tomography, gene expression analysis, and finite difference
                    methods, the researchers show that the males of the
                    Danionella species possess a unique sound-generating
                    apparatus that includes drumming cartilage, a specialized
                    rib, and a fatigue-resistant muscle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This apparatus accelerates the drumming cartilage with a
                    force of over 2,000 g and shoots it against the swim bladder
                    to produce a rapid, loud pulse. These pulses are strung
                    together to produce calls with either bilaterally
                    alternating or unilateral muscle contractions," adds Britz.

                    The permanently transparent fish, which serve as a model
                    organism for biomedical research, are native to shallow and
                    turbid waters in Myanmar. "We assume that the competition
                    between the males in this visually restrictive environment
                    contributed to the development of the special mechanism for
                    acoustic communication," says Britz.

                    "There is a difference between emulating a 30-year-old
                    system vs. a current one that's actively making money,"
                    Parsifal said.<br />[...]<br />Many emulator makers also
                    largely agreed with Nintendo's arguments that Yuzu
                    developers were too explicit about guiding users on how to
                    play copyrighted games through channels like their Quick
                    Start Guide and Discord channel. "I think Yuzu definitely
                    crossed some line when they started explaining how to
                    actually pirate games," one anonymous emulator developer
                    told Ars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I've personally experienced how strict most emulator
                    communities/discord servers/forums are regarding copyright
                    and piracy, so it's really weird to me that Yuzu devs
                    wouldn't be like that," Lycoder added.<br />[...]<br />Emulator
                    developers I talked to also pointed out the fact that the
                    Yuzu development team

                    through a Patreon campaign. That could imply "that their
                    goal is profit-making and not educational," ZJoyKiller said,
                    which is at the very least a suspect look in parts of the
                    community.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The fact that they are making money is a big no-no,
                    definitely how you can get on the [legal] radar," Parsifal
                    said.<br />[...]<br />Among the developers I talked to, it
                    doesn't seem like Nintendo's new lawsuit has had much of a
                    chilling effect on the work they're continuing to do on a
                    wide array of emulation projects. "It's more of a reminder
                    to keep up best practices that I already try to follow," one
                    anonymous developer told me. "It's not going to stop me from
                    making emulators," StrikerX3 added.<br />[...]<br />For the
                    most part, though, a healthy fear of
                    <a

                    >
                    seems to have been baked in well before this week's legal
                    developments. "From a personal standpoint, it just
                    reinforces that if I were to write a Nintendo emulator, even
                    of an old system, I'd probably keep my repo completely
                    private," ZJoyKiller said. "Or if public, I'd do so under a
                    different account. But I've always thought this anyway.
                    So... no, this ruling doesn't change much on how I see
                    this."

                  <p>
                    Penn Engineers have developed a new chip that uses light
                    waves, rather than electricity, to perform the complex math
                    essential to training AI. The chip has the potential to
                    radically accelerate the processing speed of computers while
                    also reducing their energy consumption.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The interaction of light waves with matter represents
                    one possible avenue for developing computers that supersede
                    the limitations of today's chips, which are essentially
                    based on the same principles as chips from the earliest days
                    of the computing revolution in the 1960s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Instead of using a silicon wafer of uniform height,
                    explains Engheta, "you make the silicon thinner, say 150
                    nanometers," but only in specific regions. Those variations
                    in height -- without the addition of any other materials --
                    provide a means of controlling the propagation of light
                    through the chip, since the variations in height can be
                    distributed to cause light to scatter in specific patterns,
                    allowing the chip to perform mathematical calculations at
                    the speed of light.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] this design is already ready for commercial
                    applications, and could potentially be adapted for use in
                    graphics processing units (GPUs), the demand for which has
                    skyrocketed with the widespread interest in developing new
                    AI systems. "They can adopt the Silicon Photonics platform
                    as an add-on," says Aflatouni, "and then you could speed up
                    training and classification."

                  <p>
                    An experimental new forensic spray allows latent
                    fingerprints to be made visible in just 10 seconds, plus it
                    doesn't require the use of any messy powders. What it does
                    incorporate, however, is a glowing protein that's obtained
                    from jellyfish.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Current methods of lifting fingerprints from crime scenes
                    utilize fine powders or fuming chemical reagents. In both
                    cases, obtaining a usable print takes at least a few
                    minutes. Additionally, compounds in the powders or reagents
                    may damage DNA in the sweat or skin oil that makes up the
                    print.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists from Britain's University of Bath and China's
                    Shanghai Normal University have now come up with an
                    alternative, in the form of the new non-toxic, water-soluble
                    spray.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As soon as the spray has been applied to a surface, the
                    positively-charged dye molecules bind with
                    negatively-charged fatty or amino acid molecules in the
                    fingerprint sweat or oil. The dye molecules are then "locked
                    in place" along all the telltale whorls and ridges of the
                    print.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Both dyes are derived from a substance produced by
                    jellyfish, called Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). That
                    protein is already widely used in scientific studies to
                    visualize biological processes, without affecting those
                    processes. It likewise doesn't affect the DNA which may be
                    present in fingerprints.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When exposed to blue light, those molecules fluoresce in
                    their yellow or red color within no more than 10 seconds. A
                    smartphone camera can then be used to record their images
                    for subsequent reference.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are actually two versions of it containing two
                    different dyes, namely LFP-Yellow and LFP-Red. Users choose
                    one or the other depending on the color of the surface from
                    which they're lifting prints, so that the prints really
                    stand out against their background when made visible.

                    Evolution has produced a wondrously diverse variety of
                    lifeforms here on Earth. It just so happens that talking
                    primates with opposable thumbs rose to the top and are
                    building a spacefaring civilization. And we're
                    land-dwellers. But what about other planets? If the dominant
                    species on an ocean world builds a technological
                    civilization of some sort, would they be able to escape
                    their ocean home and explore space?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A new article in the Journal of the British Interplanetary
                    Society examines the idea of civilizations on other worlds
                    and the factors that govern their ability to explore their
                    solar systems. Its title is "<a

                    >." The sole author is Elio Quiroga, a professor at the
                    Universidad del Atlántico Medio in Spain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We have no way of knowing if other Extraterrestrial
                    Intelligences (ETIs) exist or not. There's at least some
                    possibility that other civilizations exist, and we're
                    certainly in no position to say for sure that they don't.
                    The Drake Equation is one of the tools we use to talk about
                    the existence of ETIs. It's a kind of structured thought
                    experiment in the form of an equation that allows us to
                    estimate the existence of other active, communicative ETIs.
                    Some of the variables in the Drake Equation (DE) are the
                    star formation rate, the number of planets around those
                    stars, and the fraction of planets that could form life and
                    on which life could evolve to become an ETI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In his new research article, Quiroga comes up with two new
                    concepts that feed into the DE: the Exoplanet Escape Factor
                    and Fishbowl worlds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Quiroga's Exoplanet Escape Factor (Fex) can help us
                    imagine what kinds of worlds could host ETIs. It can help us
                    anticipate the factors that prevent or at least inhibit
                    space travel, and it brings more complexity into the Drake
                    Equation. It leads us to the idea of Fishbowl Worlds,
                    inescapable planets that could keep a civilization
                    planet-bound forever.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Without the ability to ever escape their planet and explore
                    their solar systems, and without the ability to communicate
                    beyond their worlds, could entire civilizations rise and
                    fall without ever knowing the Universe they were a part of?
                    Could it happen right under our noses, so to speak, and we'd
                    never know ?

                  <p>
                    At a time when one viral video can damage a business, some
                    companies are turning to their own commenting platforms
                    rather than letting social media be the main outlet for
                    customer feedback. Only one wrinkle: in this context,
                    customers appear to prefer writing a message rather than
                    leaving a video.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a recent study, more participants indicated they would
                    likely leave written compliments or complaints about service
                    on a restaurant-provided tablet powered by artificial
                    intelligence. A video message option appeared to discourage
                    leaving feedback.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With more restaurants and hotels turning to AI to enhance
                    their service, the findings indicate that methods that
                    require "low self-disclosure" would work better, meaning
                    ones that don't require customers to provide very much
                    identifiable information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Some restaurants and hotels actually ask customers to
                    create video testimonials that they can share, but for
                    general customers, it seems they still feel more comfortable
                    with low self-disclosure. This is probably because people
                    still do not trust AI to that level," said lead author
                    Ruiying Cai, a researcher in Washington State University's
                    Carson College of Business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With a lot of hype around AI technology, many people have
                    misperceptions about what it can do, Cai pointed out,
                    perhaps believing it is capable of a lot more than simply
                    recording a message.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study participants reported being concerned about what
                    would be done with their information in all the scenarios,
                    but this was heightened with the option to leave a video.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers found that the participants were more
                    willing to give feedback using text, whether positive or
                    negative.

                    harmony with local melodies from the Middle East, India, and
                    other parts of the world. That can be more or less
                    successful, but one problem is that notes can sound
                    dissonant if you play them with Western instruments."

                    specially chosen real or synthesized instruments. Then they

                    A day after American fast food chain Wendy's announced plans
                    to test dynamic pricing and AI menu features in 2025, the
                    company clarified its plans.

                  <p>
                    Wendy's said it will not dynamically raise menu prices based
                    on demand after reports about the experiment, which was set
                    to roll out in 2025, caused a stir online. In a statement to

                      >Reuters</a
                    >, a Wendy's spokesperson said it "would not raise prices
                    when our customers are visiting us most." Instead, the
                    company framed experimental price changes as discounts
                    during "slower times of day."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We said these menuboards would give us more flexibility to
                    change the display of featured items. This was misconstrued
                    in some media reports as an intent to raise prices when
                    demand is highest," the company told Reuters. "We have no
                    plans to do that."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Presuming that lowered prices during slow times will
                    eventually rise again, it appears some sort of dynamic
                    pricing will still be taking place.

                    throughout the day depending on demand, similar to "surge

                    initiative was disclosed by Kirk Tanner, the CEO and
                    president of Wendy's, in a recent discussion with analysts.

                    [...] In conversation with Food &amp; Wine, a spokesperson
                    for Wendy's confirmed the company's commitment to this
                    pricing strategy, describing it as part of a broader effort
                    to grow its digital business. "Beginning as early as 2025,
                    we will begin testing a variety of enhanced features on
                    these digital menuboards like dynamic pricing, different
                    offerings in certain parts of the day, AI-enabled menu
                    changes and suggestive selling based on factors such as
                    weather," they said. "Dynamic pricing can allow Wendy's to
                    be competitive and flexible with pricing, motivate customers
                    to visit and provide them with the food they love at a great
                    value. We will test a number of features that we think will
                    provide an enhanced customer and crew experience."

                Is this the browser we programmers have been waiting for? The

                [Ed's comment: The linked source is obviously intended to show a
                potential user how it will work, and in this role it does a
                reasonable job. But there is not a great deal to explain why
                they think it is a game changer, or why it will appeal to many
                users. If it is necessary to use Lisp to extend the browser then
                perhaps it will not have the impact that they seem to believe it
                will have. But what do you think? Will it gain a foothold, or
                simply fade away to be forgotten except perhaps for a few
                enthusiasts?]

                      >spun back out</a
                    >. Today Reddit approaches the public markets with more than
                    $800 million worth of revenue in 2023, up from $666.7
                    million in 2022.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the company remains unprofitable on both a GAAP and
                    adjusted basis, and continues to consume cash to fund its
                    operations. Scale has not yet solved the profitability
                    question for Reddit, which could limit its potential
                    valuation when it does list its shares.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2022, Reddit generated a net loss of $158.6 million and
                    had an adjusted EBITDA of negative $108.4 million. In 2023,
                    those figures improved to a $90.8 million net loss and $69.3
                    million worth of negative adjusted EBITDA. The company's
                    free cash flow improved from –$100.3 million to –$84.8
                    million over the same timeframe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company may be making progress toward stemming the red
                    ink that is missed in its annual figures. In the final
                    quarter of 2023, Reddit not only posted what was at least a
                    local maximum in revenue terms — $249.8 million — but also a
                    net profit of $18.5 million. While the GAAP profit is
                    notable for the fourth quarter, the company's free cash flow
                    was still negative in the period, ending the three-month
                    period at –$22 million.

                  <p>
                    Reddit raised more than $1 billion while private,

                    >. The Series E pushed Reddit's valuation to $6.4 billion,
                    while its Series F took it to a roughly $10 billion
                    valuation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Both of those bubble-era valuations will be tested in
                    Reddit's now quickly forthcoming IPO. But the company's
                    debut will be more than a test for certain private-market
                    startup valuations. Reddit is reportedly trying something
                    novel in its own flotation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In what is broadly viewed as an unorthodox move, Reddit
                    reportedly plans to reserve an undetermined number of shares
                    for 75,000 of its users, according to the
                    <a

                      >Wall Street Journal</a
                    >, which cited people familiar with the matter. Those users
                    will be given the chance to scoop up shares of Reddit at its
                    IPO price before the stock even begins trading — something
                    typically reserved only for large investors.

                    [....] In seeking ways to optimize classical computing, Sels
                    and his colleagues at the Simons Foundation focused on a
                    type of tensor network that faithfully represents the
                    interactions between the qubits. Those types of networks
                    have been notoriously hard to deal with, but recent advances
                    in the field now allow these networks to be optimized with
                    tools borrowed from statistical inference.

                    The authors compare the work of the algorithm to the
                    compression of an image into a JPEG file, which allows large
                    images to be stored using less space by eliminating
                    information with barely perceivable loss in the quality of
                    the image.

                    Altermagnets have a special combination of the arrangement
                    of spins and crystal symmetries. The spins alternate, as in
                    antiferromagnets, resulting in no net magnetisation. Yet,
                    rather than simply cancelling out, the symmetries give an
                    electronic band structure with strong spin polarization that

                    bands -- hence the name altermagnets. This results in highly
                    useful properties more resemblant of ferromagnets, as well
                    as some completely new properties.

                Spintronics has promised to revolutionise IT. Typically,
                ferromagnets have been used as they offer highly desirable,
                strong, spin-dependent physical phenomena. Yet the macroscopic
                net magnetisation that is useful in so many other applications
                poses practical limitations on the scalability of these devices
                as it causes crosstalk between bits. Instead, Antiferromagnets
                have been investigated for spintronics, as they have no net
                magnetisation and thus offer ultra-scalability and energy
                efficiency. However, the strong spin-dependent effects are
                lacking, again hindering their practical applicability.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enter altermagnets with the best of both: zero net magnetisation
                together with the coveted strong spin-dependent phenomena
                typically found in ferromagnets -- merits that were regarded as
                principally incompatible.

                    The researchers believe that this new fundamental discovery
                    in magnetism will enrich our understanding of
                    condensed-matter physics, with impact across diverse areas
                    of research and technology. As well as its advantages to the
                    developing field of spintronics, it also offers a promising
                    platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity,
                    through new insights into superconducting states that can
                    arise in different magnetic materials.

                    "Altermagnetism is actually not something hugely
                    complicated. It is something entirely fundamental that was
                    in front of our eyes for decades without noticing it," says
                    Jungwirth. "And it is not something that exists only in a
                    few obscure materials. It exists in many crystals that
                    people simply had in their drawers. In that sense, now that
                    we have brought it to light, many people around the world
                    will be able to work on it, giving the potential for a broad

                    People who quit smoking see major gains in life expectancy
                    after just a few years, according to a new study by

                      >study</a
                    >, published in <em>NEJM Evidence</em>, shows that smokers
                    who quit smoking before age 40 can expect to live almost as
                    long as those who never smoked. Those who quit at any age
                    return close to never-smoker survival 10 years after
                    quitting, and about half that benefit occurs within just
                    three years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Former smokers lowered their risk of death to 1.3-fold
                    (or 30 per cent higher) compared to never smokers. Stopping
                    smoking at any age was associated with longer survival, and
                    even those who quit for less than three years gained up to
                    six years in life expectancy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Many people think it's too late to quit smoking, especially
                    in middle age," said Jha. "But these results counter that
                    line of thought. It's never too late, the impact is fast and
                    you can reduce risk across major diseases, meaning a longer
                    and better quality of life."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers found that quitting smoking reduced the risk
                    of dying from vascular disease and cancer, in particular.
                    Former smokers also reduced their risk of death from
                    respiratory disease, but slightly less so, likely due to
                    residual lung damage.

                    It may not be super easy to get to: "Most hydrogen is likely
                    inaccessible," Ellis told the <em>Financial Times</em>. "But
                    a few per cent recovery would still supply all projected
                    demand – 500 million tonnes a year – for hundreds of years."

                  <p>
                    Gold hydrogen won't won't hog renewable energy like
                    electrolyzers, or divert it away from other decarbonization
                    opportunities. In that sense, you could argue it'll have the
                    potential to be significantly greener than green hydrogen.
                    On the other hand, if tapping it releases methane into the
                    atmosphere, that's a serious issue; methane is around 85
                    times more powerful a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide
                    over a 20-year time frame.

                    changes made to search in response to the DMA are providing
                    more opportunities for services such as Yelp to show up in
                    results. "To suggest otherwise is plain wrong," he says.
                    Overall, Google's tests of various DMA-inspired designs show
                    clicks to review and comparison websites are up, O'Donoghue
                    says—at the cost of users losing shortcuts to Google tools
                    and individual businesses like airlines and restaurants
                    facing a drop in visits from Google search. "We've been
                    seeking feedback from a range of stakeholders over many
                    months as we try to balance the needs of different types of
                    websites while complying with the law," he says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google, which generates 30 percent of its sales from Europe,
                    the Middle East, and Africa, views the DMA as disrespecting
                    its expertise in what users want. Critics such as Yelp argue
                    that Google sometimes siphons users away from the more
                    reliable content they offer. Yelp competes with Google for
                    advertisers but generated less than 1 percent of its record
                    sales of $1.3 billion last year from outside the US. An
                    increase in European traffic could significantly boost its
                    business.

                    sent today to US Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). Khan's letter
                    said the access was limited because employees refused to
                    comply with Musk's demands:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        The deposition testimony revealed that in early December
                        2022, Elon Musk had reportedly directed staff to grant
                        an outside third-party individual "full access to
                        everything at Twitter... No limits at all." Consistent
                        with Musk's direction, the individual was initially
                        assigned a company laptop and internal account, with the
                        intent that the third-party individual be given
                        "elevated privileges" beyond what an average company
                        employee might have.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        However, based on a concern that such an arrangement
                        would risk exposing nonpublic user information in
                        potential violation of the FTC's Order, longtime
                        information security employees at Twitter intervened and
                        implemented safeguards to mitigate the risks. Ultimately
                        the third-party individuals did not receive direct
                        access to Twitter's systems, but instead worked with
                        other company employees who accessed the systems on the
                        individuals' behalf.

                    Jordan is chair of the House Judiciary Committee and has
                    criticized the investigation,
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/04/house-republican-tries-to-protect-musk-and-twitter-from-ftc-investigation/"
                      >claiming</a
                    >
                    that "the FTC harassed Twitter in the wake of Mr. Musk's
                    acquisition." Khan's letter to Jordan today argues that the
                    FTC investigation was justified.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The FTC's investigation confirmed that staff was right to
                    be concerned, given that Twitter's new CEO had directed
                    employees to take actions that would have violated the FTC's
                    Order," Khan wrote. "Once staff learned that the FTC's Order
                    had worked to ensure that Twitter employees took appropriate
                    measures to protect consumers' private information,
                    compliance staff made no further inquiries to Twitter or
                    anyone else concerning this issue."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Khan also wrote that deep staff cuts following the Musk
                    acquisition, and resignations of Twitter's top privacy and
                    compliance officials, meant that "there was no one left at
                    the company responsible for interpreting and modifying data
                    policies and practices to ensure Twitter was complying with
                    the FTC's Order to safeguard Americans' personal data." The
                    letter continued:
