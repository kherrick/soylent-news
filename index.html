                    The researchers obtained these results by using an
                    exploratory ensemble approach, which samples several
                    variables at different levels —for example, carbon emissions
                    at different levels of emission—to obtain an understanding
                    of the breadth of potential future scenarios.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Instead of using narrative-based scenarios, which tend to
                    ask questions such as, 'What if we have a high inequality
                    world?' or 'What if we have a low carbon development world?'
                    we developed a large ensemble of scenarios," said first
                    author Xinyuan Huang, a doctoral student in the Penn State
                    Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. "This
                    approach couples models of climate, energy and health to
                    explore a wide range of plausible futures."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this assessment, the researchers modeled the energy and
                    land system changes for 32 geopolitical regions based on the
                    Global Change Analysis Model, an open-source integrated
                    assessment model. They then conducted the air quality and
                    health impact assessment for nearly 200 countries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Peng said that since the future is deeply uncertain, the
                    likelihood of potential future scenarios that involve health
                    co-harms are unknown, but their findings demonstrate the
                    possibilities of unintended consequences of climate
                    mitigation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What I find especially useful is that now we can start to
                    think about the levers we have, and how we can use them to
                    mitigate harmful impacts and to embrace the benefits," she
                    said. "If we go for the bioenergy-heavy future, then we
                    really need to pay attention to how we manage land."

                    The decision, announced amid a dispute over chip technology
                    between Washington and Beijing, could include sectors
                    ranging from transport to finance, according to China's

                    "The review found that Micron's products have serious
                    network security risks, which pose significant security
                    risks to China's critical information infrastructure supply
                    chain, affecting China's national security," the Cyberspace

                    Micron derives around 10% of its revenue from China, but it

                  <p>
                    The researchers delved deeply into employment data from a
                    major retailer that was experiencing high turnover to find
                    out why. They reviewed data for roughly a million employees
                    — including when they were hired, which store, which
                    position, when they left, and why.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study authors also had access to employee performance
                    records, so they could evaluate whether workers were high
                    performers or low performers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "It's very bad news for organizations, especially if
                    they are laying off high performers, because if those
                    positions get eliminated, both high and low performers start
                    quitting," said Dr. Sajjadiani. "It's a signal that people's
                    jobs aren't secure, and the organization doesn't care about
                    them, no matter how hard they work. So they think, 'I should
                    leave as soon as possible.'"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When employees quit their jobs voluntarily, their departures
                    give a more moderate boost to voluntary turnover, and it
                    takes longer for that ripple effect to occur.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To high performers, voluntary exits are a positive signal
                    that there are better opportunities elsewhere," said Dr.
                    Sajjadiani. "So while employees might not leave immediately,
                    they do begin to look for other opportunities."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, when a high performer is dismissed without
                    clear justification, employers not only open themselves to
                    legal headaches, it also sends the wrong message to other
                    high performers. They also start heading for the door.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Dr. Sajjadiani, organizations vastly
                    underestimate the ripple effects of people leaving and the
                    resulting human capital costs. The research also sends a
                    clear message to organizations that they should be extremely
                    careful when they make exit decisions, or they risk
                    destabilizing the whole organization very quickly.

                    Micro and nanoplastics are pervasive in our food supply and
                    may be affecting food safety and security on a global scale,
                    a new study led by CSIRO, Australia's national science
                    agency, has found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study is one of the first to analyze the academic
                    literature on microplastics from a food safety and food
                    security risk viewpoint, building on past studies which
                    primarily tracked plastics in fish.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It shows that plastics and their additives are present at a
                    range of concentrations not only in fish but in many
                    products including meat, chicken, rice, water, take-away
                    food and drink, and even fresh produce.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    CSIRO analytical chemist, food safety specialist and lead
                    author of the paper, Dr. Jordi Nelis, said these plastics
                    enter the human food chain through numerous pathways, such
                    as ingestion as shown in the fish studies, but one of the
                    main ways is through food processing and packaging. The
                    research is published in the journal
                    <i>TrAC Trends in Analytical Chemistry</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There are currently no definitive studies that
                    demonstrate micro and nanoplastics in the environment cause
                    harm to humans, however more research is needed to fully
                    understand health effects.

                    [...] "The key missing information is determining safe
                    levels of microplastics. We currently don't know exactly
                    what the microplastic flux through the food system is or
                    which levels can be considered safe," Dr. Nelis said.

                    On May 9, NASA's Lucy spacecraft carried out a trajectory
                    correction maneuver to set the spacecraft on course for its
                    close encounter with the small main belt asteroid Dinkinesh.
                    The maneuver changed the velocity of the spacecraft by only
                    about 7.7 mph (3.4 m/s).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even though the spacecraft is currently traveling at
                    approximately 43,000 mph (19.4 km/s), this small nudge is
                    enough to move the spacecraft nearly 40,000 miles (65,000
                    km) closer to the asteroid during the planned encounter on
                    Nov. 1, 2023. The spacecraft will fly a mere 265 miles (425
                    km) from the small, half-mile-(sub-km)-sized asteroid, while
                    traveling at a relative speed of 10,000 mph (4.5 km/s).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Lucy team will continue to monitor the spacecraft's
                    trajectory and will have further opportunities to fine tune
                    the flight path if needed.

                    The Lucy team is also continuing to analyze the data
                    collected from its spring instrument calibration campaign
                    and make other preparations for the mission's first asteroid
                    encounter. This encounter will provide a valuable test of
                    the spacecraft's systems and procedures to make sure that
                    everything operates as expected during the mission's
                    high-speed asteroid encounters.

                    If you've ever had to write a program which interfaces
                    directly with hardware — perhaps while writing a program for
                    an MCU or embedded system or a kernel driver — you may have
                    noticed a few common patterns in register map behaviour and
                    design. I'm not sure anyone has ever really collected them
                    together, so I decided to make a list of all the ones I can
                    think of.

              <p>
                This is a post that I have suspected that I was going to have to
                write since late December last year.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will now know that SoylentNews.org is closing down on 30
                June but things have not been standing still behind the scenes
                since we first became aware of NCommander's decision at the end
                of last week. In fact, it has been a very busy weekend.
              </p>
              <p>
                A small group of existing staff are looking at alternative
                possibilities for a 'replacement' site to keep the flow of
                stories going and allowing discussions to continue. This is a
                big task, especially in the 38 days remaining in which to try to
                achieve it. There are several possibilities which spring to
                mind, Pipedot for example. I have reached out to Bryan but have
                not yet received a response. However, things as not as
                straightforward as they seem. The pipecode is written in Php-5
                which some of you will realise is no longer supported. We do not
                want to become dependant on old software which cannot be
                maintained into the future; that lesson has been taken aboard
                and reinforced by NCommander's explanation regarding his
                decision announced today. There are other options but at the
                moment it is still a search for what is available out there
                today which also appears maintainable into the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                But the first thing we need to know is "Is there still
                sufficient interest in having a discussion site such as ours?"
                Do you, the community, still want to have your daily dose of
                stories and the ability to exchange views with many others on
                this site? Are there any community members who would be willing
                to join us in trying to establish such a site? Your views are
                crucial to everything that we do over the coming days and weeks.
                So please let us know what you think about whether a site is
                still required with all the alternative technology available
                today that simply didn't exist 9 years ago. What form should a
                new site take? What changes to how we operate are essential for
                you to continue to remain interested in the future site?
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, it cannot be a mirror image of what we have today -
                which many will see as a good thing! But I hope that we would be
                able to transfer existing accounts, usernames and passwords
                directly to any new site that we create. We would also have to
                start with a relatively simple site and build on that over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of the day we would have to restart the voluntary
                subscriptions but not immediately. We can raise some funds to
                see us get established without the requirement of a financial
                commitment from the community. Subscriptions were always
                sufficient in the past and I don't see why that would not be the
                case in the future too. The fact that we currently have enough
                to keep this site going until next year bears witness to that.
                We have also found that we can significantly reduce our running
                costs based on our current community rather than being ready for
                a major stream of new members which never materialises. I have
                no grandiose ideas of becoming a huge site employing our own
                journalists but just a community that enjoys the discussions as
                we have been doing for several years. Nevertheless, we would
                also be trying to build on our existing community which is
                beginning to happen on this site now that things have settled
                down.
              </p>
              <p>So don't hold back - let us know what you think.</p>

              <h3>Technical Reasons</h3>
              <p>
                Let's start with the technical nitty gritty. SoylentNews was, in
                November 2022, at the point where it was about to have a fatal
                database crash. The database cluster was wedged in an invalid
                state. Backups weren't properly being done. As it was, we lost
                several days of postings after a hard crash. On top of that, we
                had multiple public facing machines running outdated versions of
                CentOS and Ubuntu running net facing services.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's two distinct problems here, both of which have to be
                addressed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first is the site itself, and specifically what we can or
                can't do with it. At this point, rehash, the backend that runs
                SoylentNews, is nearly 30 years old, and it was written in what
                can be generously described as angry and especially esoteric
                Perl. Perl was already going extinct when we launched in 2014,
                and at this point is mostly relegated to legacy backend code
                which is slowly but surely disappearing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Complicating matters is that rehash is specifically tied into
                Apache 2.2 via mod_perl, a version that is well past end of life
                and significantly out of date. While the website is well
                sandboxed and battle hardened, running obsolete code on the
                public Internet is not a smart move especially when combined
                with many of the other factors listed below.
              </p>
              <p>
                To just keep up with patched software, we would either need to
                port the site to Apache 2.4 and a recent version of mod_perl, or
                break the Apache dependency with an alternative like FastCGI.
                This would also require updating the base version of Perl5 to
                something more recent and hoping all the necessary CPAN modules
                have either been updated, or can be reasonably replaced, which
                is doubtful at best
              </p>
              <p>
                As the person who actually did the base port of rehash from
                Apache 1.3 to Apache 2, this is a massive project regardless of
                which way we would go. This would require a full rebuild of the
                /srv/soylentnews.org directory which alone could easily take
                weeks or months of work. That doesn't take into account all the
                other bits of infrastructure and software that would need to be
                reworked, rebuilt, or replaced.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we migrated to rehash, we had more staff who could QA the
                site and quite a bit went wrong trying to do that relatively
                simpler migration.
              </p>
              <p>As we are now?</p>
              <p>I don't see how it's possible anymore.</p>
              <p>
                After everything that has played out, I'm having trouble working
                up sufficient motivation to work on the site and bring it up to
                a serviceable state when combined with the amount of friction
                I've experienced just getting us here.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had hoped to hire outside help or at least raise enough
                through livestreaming other SN related work to offset the costs.
                At this point though I believe that is a lost cause as well. If
                this was the only major problem, it would be bad enough.
                Unfortunately, it's just the tip of a very large and very ugly
                iceberg.
              </p>
              <p>
                The deeper problem is that everything else has bitrotted over
                time.
              </p>
              <p>
                SN's backend is something of a jigsaw puzzle which is documented
                in one of three places: on the site, on the internal technical
                wiki (which is currently down), and on the old public facing
                wiki which is also down. None of that documentation was or is
                consistent with the actual state of reality, and quite a few
                parts, like the MySQL cluster, were somewhat esoteric.
              </p>
              <p>
                In practice, if you want to know how anything was plugged into
                anything, it was a matter of pulling cables and figuring out
                what broke. It also doesn't help that the backend is notoriously
                noisy. That makes it hard to sort out real errors from the
                chaff. This was a large part of why the Zoo plugin, which does
                the sidebars, was broken for most of December. It also didn't
                help that we had three different OSes (Ubuntu, CentOS, Gentoo)
                which complicated system administration.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, there have been major disagreements among the
                sysops on actually doing any major upgrades. Someone would
                complain that we should do something. There would be a lot of
                arguments about it. In most cases, nothing got done. Because of
                this ongoing friction, it became increasingly more common for no
                one to install updates. This is why we never upgraded from
                Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 back in 2016. I eventually said we should
                just go to Gentoo, since there was a widespread belief that
                upgrading the distribution would break everything. This
                suggestion ultimately just ended up with only our development
                machine on Gentoo, and that too was woefully out of date.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I finally checked in in November 2022, after two years, the
                site had finally reached a breaking point. I talked with some
                people in #chillax, and I got a state of affairs from
                mechanicjay, and I decided to do what should have been done long
                ago.
              </p>
              <p>Clean house.</p>
              <p>
                I didn't ask for permission. I didn't wait for people to answer
                DMs. I just did it because we had done this go around one too
                many times in the past.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will let the community decide if I was justified or not in
                doing so.
              </p>
              <p>
                A lot of this involved installing over a decade of upgrades.
                Setting up and configuring firewalls and removing unneeded
                services. Backing up and decommissioning old boxes. Given the
                extended period of time without updates, you can imagine that I
                at least have some concern at the number of potentially
                vulnerable backend services that were exposed to the Internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                I found no evidence of breach, but given the period of time, and
                general lack of maintenance, I am at best uneasy.
              </p>
              <p>I could have done better.</p>
              <p>
                In the end, I finally installed almost a decade of upgrades in
                December of 2022, but that only postponed the inevitable. I also
                trimmed the number of machines and services in an effort to be
                at least slightly more secure on the Internet. However,
                ultimately, without a way to bring in new users, SN is slowly
                going to attrition itself to death.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some might argue that I simply let it be, or should have let it
                be in November, but I really did hope that I could pull it out
                of this death spiral. Over the last few months, it has become
                clear that the only way work is going to be done is if I do it
                or if a miracle happens.
              </p>
              <p>The problem is: as part-owner, where do you go from here?</p>
              <p>There's also the matter of liability.</p>
              <p>
                Ultimately speaking, if something happened with SN, Matt and I
                would be jointly responsible since our names are on the legal
                documents. I tried to find someone to take my place, and failed.
                I am legally attached to something that is barely being
                maintained, and frankly, I can't carry this cross any further.
              </p>
              <p><b>My Role In This Outcome</b></p>
              <p>
                I guess this falls down to a lot of my personal responsibility.
                While SN is at its heart a community project, it is also a
                business, one for which I have served as its president for its
                entire life. I really had no idea what I was doing when we
                started, and this had long term effects on SN as a whole. Part
                of this was that we only had subscriptions as a revenue stream.
              </p>
              <p>
                Without a more solid revenue stream, the PBC was essentially
                hostage to the small trickle of money subscriptions. In a
                volunteer organization, it's a matter of "who shows up to do the
                work" dictating the direction of the site.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the early days this wasn't a problem, I had plenty of free
                time, and people were often willing to help. That's largely how
                the site got ported to Apache 2, and why we were able to stay up
                for more than a year. Meanwhile, solving UTF-8 support was one
                of TMB's and MartyB's projects. As the early enthusiasm died off
                and staff began to leave, essential tasks were becoming less and
                less likely to be done.
              </p>
              <p>
                That ultimately created a negative feedback loop in which
                technical debt continued to pile up.
              </p>
              <p>
                SoylentNews also doesn't have a growing community, partially
                because we have very few inbound links, and are fairly low in
                search results. In our early days, folks followed us from
                Slashdot, and some viral posts on places like reddit and
                HackerNew did help to build the community, but this has largely
                evaporated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Growth of some sort is important because communities have a
                natural attrition rate. People leave, die, or otherwise go
                inactive. Year over year, the community has shrunk, primarily
                because we don't bring in a lot of new blood.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, the Internet as a whole has changed. When we
                started, GamerGate was yet to happen. The world couldn't even
                imagine the rise of the Trump presidency. In theory, the
                moderation system should have been able to handle
                disinformation, but the mod system requires a certain critical
                mass to work. Slashdot's mod system could only work as it does
                on a large community, and we found at least one critical flaw
                with its base assumption:
              </p>
              <p>People rarely if ever downvote.</p>
              <p>
                This, combined with ineffective anti-spam meant that it was
                relatively easy to game the system, and allowing bad actors
                outweighed good. My perception was SN's signal to noise ratio
                was becoming more noise year over year, and there were many
                conversations on this, which ultimately went nowhere. For me,
                personally, it finally reached a head with COVID. The amount of
                medical misinformation and similar such disinformation got to
                the point that I felt we needed to drastically overhaul the
                site.
              </p>
              <p>This lead to some very bitter arguments.</p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, I was overruled, and I attempted to resign after
                bitter arguments in the staff channel. My resignation was
                written, but ultimately never posted, and I left on bad terms
                with the staff at the time. Consequently, I remained President
                of the PBC. At that time, I requested Matt remove me from the
                position, but we never formalized this, primarily because there
                was no one to replace me. It should also be noted that we were
                missing a secretary and unable to find a replacement after
                mrcoolbp withdrew due to personal life reasons.
              </p>
              <p>
                I could have, and perhaps should have, forced the issue then,
                but I could still remember how the domain was hijacked in our
                early days, and didn't want this to be a case of sour grapes. I
                also had a reasonable belief that SN would still be maintained
                by the active staff. I turned my attention towards my other
                endeavors such as my YouTube channel and tried to put it behind
                me.
              </p>
              <p>Two years passed.</p>
              <p>
                That was not the end of the infighting, and that ultimately led
                up to TMB leaving in 2021. The site was now running with the
                bare minimum of maintenance mechanicjay supported by audioguy
                could give it with no hope of a long term solution in sight. Had
                I not checked in, and decided to do emergency maintenance, the
                odds are that it would have been a matter of weeks or months
                before a severe system crash would have irreparably corrupted
                the database.
              </p>
              <p>
                As it was, we had two hard crashes that lost weeks of posts.
                There were no functioning backups that I could find.
              </p>
              <p>
                I did two emergency rounds of maintenance that saw the backend
                database replaced with a standard vanilla MySQL instance and
                drastically downsized the number of machines, cutting the
                monthly bill more than half.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, it's become clear to me that this was too little, too
                late.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many of the issues that were present when I resigned were still
                here. At the end of the day, I found myself caught between my
                responsibility towards my site and my own frustrations for what
                it had become. This combined with a personal disaster in my life
                starting in December meant that I had very little time for SN.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was also combined with the dawning realization of how
                difficult it would be to get new sysops and devs to replace
                myself and those that had left. While I was willing at least to
                put some of the legwork in, no one really wanted to sit down and
                help with the business side of things. It felt like everyone
                else decided we should all hum loudly. While we had some
                volunteers for sysops, my lack of time, combined with the
                relatively arcane nature of our backend mostly nothing being
                done.
              </p>
              <p>
                I honestly don't know if there was one specific misstep that led
                to this outcome. However, the need for sites like Slashdot and
                SoylentNews was already passing when we launched. Slashdot is a
                shell of itself, and most of the role of news aggregator is
                taken up with sites like reddit and HackerNews. The need for
                something like SN has largely disappeared.
              </p>
              <p>
                That means for SN to exist, it has to exist for itself, and
                well, that's the rub of it. SN stopped being maintained while I
                was absent. It wasn't being well maintained well before that
                point. It's not going to be maintained now simply because I
                can't justify the time and effort anymore and no one else is
                putting time or effort into this either.
              </p>
              <p>
                Suggestions like running ads to try and pay for some of the
                maintenance costs have either been rejected or at least treated
                with enough skepticism that makes me doubtful it would help.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, I'm tired of fighting over every single issue which in
                the end leads to nothing being done and everyone just walking
                away unhappy.
              </p>
              <p><b>What Would Have Been Needed To Save SN?</b></p>
              <p>
                As before, I'll break this into two sections, involving the
                technical, and the non-technical. To summarize, it essentially
                required people to take responsibility and pledge to fix it as
                well as relieve me from my position from the PBC.
              </p>
              <p>
                Technically speaking, we'd need to be able to refresh the site
                infrastructure as well as the site's backend dependencies.
                You're essentially dealing with a legacy Linux install that has
                been upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 22.04 that at least a
                dozen of sysops have worked on.
              </p>
              <p>
                To reduce site admin burden, we'd probably end up migrating
                email, and most services beside IRC and the website to third
                party hosting providers. This would have solved many of the
                email and registration issues that have plagued the site since
                GMail made their spam barriers extremely hostile to external
                SMTP hosted mail.
              </p>
              <p>
                We would also need a development environment that properly
                tracked with production to allow changes to be done
                incrementally and rolled back, something that was a continuous
                problem throughout every major site upgrade. This would let us
                test each aspect of the overhaul and deploy it piecemeal instead
                of having the site be broken for weeks or months as happened
                with the much smaller November upgrade.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ideally, we would use an automation deployment solution such as
                GitHub Actions which would make sure the machine state was
                always in sync with the build files, and allow for easy and
                rapid deployment of backend patches and security updates.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this all done, it would have allowed site maintenance to
                easily be done en masse to all machines and without risk of the
                site breaking in new and arcane ways.
              </p>
              <p>
                I did talk to Matt about the possibility of either fundraising
                or selling stock in an effort to finance it.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also made multiple efforts to find someone who was willing to
                seriously take over the site and take over the PBC. There were a
                few email discussions that went ultimately nowhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                What it boils down to is that to do anything with the site, I
                would have to put in legwork that, after everything that has
                been said and done, I am no longer willing to do nor is anyone
                truly stepping in to try and take over for me.
              </p>
              <p>
                It doesn't help that nearly every single thing I've laid out
                here was shot down by at least one other member of staff while
                at the same time no realistic alternatives were worked on or
                even proposed.
              </p>
              <p><b>What Happens Now?</b></p>
              <p>
                At this point, we need to get the expenses of the PBC to zero.
                We have about $1,500 USD in the bank, most of which will go to
                handle our shutdown fees. I want to give a window for people to
                exchange contact info and write goodbyes. Subscriptions will be
                disabled on the site by time this post goes live. SN doesn't
                have a robust infrastructure to process refunds, and TMB wrote
                most of the code involving that. I am discussing with Matt what
                our options here are, but in the worst case scenario, any
                leftover will be donated to the EFF.
              </p>
              <p>
                A final backup of the VMs and site database will be taken and
                soylentnews.org will be redirected to a static page. Everything
                representing the site be archived and taken offline. I'm going
                to hold the domain name and backups in trust in the hope that
                circumstances in the future may allow for the site to return in
                some form.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wish I did not need to say such a thing might happen, but all
                things must end.

                    A thorough investigation has found that the inner core of
                    the Moon is, in fact, a solid ball with a density similar to
                    that of iron. This, researchers hope, will help settle a
                    long debate about whether the Moon's inner heart is solid or
                    molten, and lead to a more accurate understanding of the
                    Moon's history – and, by extension, that of the Solar

                    thanks to its demonstration of the existence of the inner
                    core and support a global mantle overturn scenario that
                    brings substantial insights on the timeline of the lunar
                    bombardment in the first billion years of the Solar System."

                  <p>
                    [...] To figure it out once and for all, Briaud and his
                    colleagues collected data from space missions and lunar
                    laser ranging experiments to compile a profile of various
                    lunar characteristics. These include the degree of its
                    deformation by its gravitational interaction with Earth, the
                    variation in its distance from Earth, and its density.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And they found that the lunar core is very similar to
                    that of Earth – with an outer fluid layer and a solid inner
                    core. According to their modeling, the outer core has a
                    radius of about 362 kilometers (225 miles), and the inner
                    core has a radius of about 258 kilometers (160 miles).
                    That's about 15 percent of the entire radius of the Moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The inner core, the team found, also has a density of about
                    7,822 kilograms per cubic meter. That's very close to the
                    density of iron.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [..] We know not long after it formed, the Moon had a
                    powerful magnetic field, which started to decline about 3.2
                    billion years ago. Such a magnetic field is generated by
                    motion and convection in the core, so what the lunar core is
                    made of is deeply relevant to how and why the magnetic field
                    disappeared.

                    Intel quietly released a new whitepaper and specification
                    for their proposal on "X86-S" as a 64-bit only x86
                    architecture. If their plans workout, in the years ahead we
                    could see a revised 64-bit only x86 architecture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Entitled "Envisioning a Simplified Intel Architecture",
                    Intel engineers lay the case for a 64-bit mode-only
                    architecture. Intel is still said to be investigating the
                    64-bit mode-only architecture that they also refer to as
                    "x86S". Intel is hoping to solicit industry feedback while
                    they continue to explore a 64-bit mode only ISA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Under this proposal, those wanting to run legacy
                    32-bit operating systems would have to rely on
                    virtualization. To further clarify, 32-bit x86 user-space
                    software would continue to work on modern 64-bit operating
                    systems with X86-S.

                    tended toward proposals, such as opt-outs and policy
                    notices, that will do little to curb the misuse of AI
                    systems. The key to effective legislation will be to
                    allocate rights and responsibilities for AI developers and
                    users. This allocation will necessarily be asymmetric as

                    Haidar of Privacy International says that creating powers to
                    collect more of people's data doesn't result in "more
                    security" for people. "Building the data retention
                    capabilities of companies and a vast range of government
                    agencies doesn't mean that intelligence operations will be
                    enhanced," Haidar says. "In fact, we argue that it makes us
                    less secure as this data becomes vulnerable to being misused
                    or abused."

                    in tax law that took effect this year has stakeholders
                    worried the mounting debt bubble will finally become fatal.
                    A San Francisco politician introduced a law this year in the
                    state legislature that would crack down on pot businesses
                    that don't pay their debts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    State law recently shifted the burden for paying cannabis
                    excise taxes from distributors to retailers, with the first
                    tax payments due May 1. Retailers have historically had the
                    most trouble paying their bills, and it appears that many
                    shops lack the cash to pay their state excise taxes,
                    according to new state tax data obtained by SFGATE.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over 13% of California's retailers, or 265 pot shops, failed
                    to make any tax payment by the May 1 deadline, according to
                    the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration.
                    Those businesses are now facing a 50% penalty on the taxes
                    they owe, which could be a death blow to many shops.

                    classroom, it's even more important to make sure people can
                    access this technology. If not, a lot of people are going to
                    get left out, and there could be a backlash," says Kelly.

                    Like motion sickness, cybersickness can occur when there's a
                    mismatch between visual motion and body motion. Symptoms,
                    including nausea, dizziness, headaches and eye fatigue,
                    usually resolve quickly after removing the headset. But in
                    severe cases, they sometimes last for hours.

                    to cybersickness, the ISU researchers recruited 150
                    participants to play up to 20 minutes of a VR game with a
                    headset. The participants were new to VR and could stop if
                    they felt too sick to continue. The researchers found women
                    ended the game early twice as often as men and reported a
                    sickness intensity that was 40% higher.

                  <p>
                    [...] For the

                      >second paper</a
                    >, the researchers explored whether the distance between an
                    individual's pupils could help explain the gender difference
                    in cybersickness. VR headsets have an adjustable lens set-up
                    to accommodate different users, but some people fall outside
                    the range. The researchers found women participants on
                    average had smaller distances between their pupils than men,
                    but it did not predict whether they would get cybersick
                    during the game.

                  <p>
                    What seemed to matter more was whether they had previous
                    experience with motion sickness or screen sickness
                    (<em>e.g</em>., feeling sick in movie theaters, while
                    playing a video game.)

                  <p>

                    screen-based sickness than men, and this increased
                    susceptibility is part of the reason that women experience
                    more cybersickness," says Kelly.

                    One of the greatest cartoons of the modern era is making a
                    return after a 10-year layoff, and you won't have to wait
                    long to start enjoying brand new episodes. The first new
                    episode of season eight will premiere on Hulu on July 24,
                    with subsequent episodes to follow on Mondays.

                    Hulu ordered a 20-episode run of Futurama in February of
                    last year that will see much of the original show's voice
                    actors and crew return, including executive producers Matt
                    Groening (The Simpsons) and David X. Cohen (Beavis and
                    Butt-Head). Billy West, Katey Sagal, Maurice LaMarche, Tress
                    MacNeille, Lauren Tom, Phil LaMarr, and David Herman are all
                    back, as is John DiMaggio who voices Bender.

                    Futurama premiered on Fox in the spring of 1999 and ran on
                    the network for five seasons before getting canceled. The
                    show would return in 2010 for a two season run on Comedy
                    Central, with the final episode of that deal airing on
                    September 4, 2013. The order with Hulu will mark the
                    program's third platform, or fourth if you count the direct
                    to DVD movies.

                    will initially consist of 10 episodes. It is unclear if the
                    remaining 10 episodes from the original order will arrive as
                    a second half of season eight or a new season entirely.

                      >description</a
                    >, new viewers will be able to pick up the series from here
                    while Futurama diehards will be rewarded with payoffs to
                    longstanding mysteries. Highlights are said to include
                    developments in the relationship of Fry and Leela, the
                    contents of Nibbler's litter box, the whereabouts of Kif and
                    Amy's tadpoles, and the history of evil Robot Santa.

                    We're still early in the snowball effect unleashed by the
                    release of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT into
                    the wild. Paired with the open-sourcing of other GPT
                    (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) models, the number of
                    applications employing AI is exploding; and as we know,
                    ChatGPT itself can be used to create highly advanced
                    malware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As time passes, applied LLMs will only increase, each
                    specializing in their own area, trained on carefully curated
                    data for a specific purpose. And one such application just
                    dropped, one that was trained on data from the dark web
                    itself.

                    DarkBERT is based on the RoBERTa architecture, an AI
                    approach developed back in 2019. It has seen a renaissance
                    of sorts, with researchers discovering it actually had more
                    performance to give than could be extracted from it in 2019.

                    "Fundamentally, there's been an increasing gap between
                    salary and the costs of housing that the standard pay rise
                    isn't covering, and it's pushing teachers further away from
                    their workplaces or out of the profession entirely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The issue is not just limited to teachers, but all
                    essential workers who are increasingly finding it difficult
                    to find affordable places to live within a reasonable
                    distance of their
                  </p>

                    "The school system is struggling to find enough teachers as
                    it is," Prof. Eacott says. "If teachers can't afford to live
                    near or within reasonable commuting distance of their
                    schools, we can only expect those shortfalls to continue to
                    grow."

                  <p>
                    [...] Prof. Eacott says part of the challenge is that no
                    single government department or the private sector is
                    ultimately responsible for housing essential workers. While
                    more investment from superannuation funds in essential
                    worker housing developments is welcome, it won't be enough
                    to address the issue at scale.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The simple answer is we do need to be paying teachers more.
                    But that may not necessarily solve supply problems," Prof.
                    Eacott says. "For example, it is just incredibly difficult
                    right now for teachers to find a place to rent given record
                    low vacancy rates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's also important that we're not confining teachers to
                    just teacher apartments, but creating pathways to home
                    ownership."

                  <p>
                    [...] "We rely so much on our teachers, so it's only fair we
                    take steps towards providing them and other essential
                    workers with affordable and secure housing options," Prof.
                    Eacott says.

                    had already been observed in the officers' quarters. "This

                    Titanic, but for all underwater exploration," because it

                Much of the wreck lies in two main pieces, far apart from each
                other, at a depth of about 4,000 meters. Around 700k images
                where taken and stitched together to created the model.

                    Personality is usually summarized in five traits - the
                    so-called "big five": Emotional stability (neuroticism),
                    extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and
                    openness. Our personality then shapes our decision-making
                    style. In a research study from Lund University, Swedish
                    obstetricians' and gynecologists' personality profiles and
                    clinical experience are linked for the first time to their
                    decision-making styles in acute childbirth situations.

                    "Obstetricians and gynecologists have a personality profile
                    that differs significantly from the population at large. On
                    average, 85 percent of Sweden's population has significantly
                    lower emotional stability, extroversion, agreeableness, and
                    conscientiousness than the obstetricians in our study. It's
                    hard not to be surprised when the differences are so clear",
                    says Petri Kajonius, associate professor of personality
                    psychology and behavioral measurement at Lund University.

                    It is our personality that defines what we will enjoy in our
                    professional life, and the consequence is likely a
                    self-selection of people who seek a certain profession.
                    Swedish obstetric-focused physicians' personalities make
                    them comfortable in an environment where a childbirth
                    situation can quickly shift to something acute and
                    potentially escalate into a crisis. Here, traits such as
                    emotional stability and conscientiousness are prominent.

                How do you assess your own personal emotional stability. Are you
                excitable, or calm and methodical, or does it change frequently
                depending upon the current situation that you find yourself?

                    higher density. Two types of CFETs are currently being
                    researched — monolithic and sequential. The four devices on
                    the right side of the above image detail various proposed
                    CFET designs. For now, it is unclear which type of design
                    Intel would adopt, or if it will devise another type of
                    implementation. Given that imec doesn't have CFETs on its
                    roadmap until around when chips shrink to 5 angstroms in the
                    2032 timeframe, it could be some time before we find out.

                  <p>
                    That said, it isn't guaranteed that Intel would target CFET
                    in that timeframe: Interestingly, Intel's slide shows its
                    next-gen GAA nanosheet transistor (RibbonFET) and then jumps
                    directly to CFET, omitting the GAA forksheet transistors
                    that most think will be the step between nanosheet and CFET.
                    You can also see that type of transistor in the above slide
                    — it is the second from the left.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Given that Intel's image isn't very detailed, it is possible
                    that the company also plans to use forksheet transistors
                    before it moves to CFET, but it hasn't chosen to share the
                    details yet. We're following up with Intel to see if we can
                    learn any more details.

                    Reddit announced Thursday that it will now allow users to

                    feature was already available on the social network's mobile

                    Banning this type of content would "protect the future of

                    Many of Reddit's communities rely on Imgur's hosting
                    services. However, the social network allowing native NSFW
                    uploads through desktop might be the most logical solution
                    going forward.

                    Video Visit Asia's emerging megacities and you'll quickly
                    notice that scooters and motorbikes vastly outnumber cars.
                    Before long these fleets of two-wheelers will become
                    battery-powered, always-connected, semi-autonomous machines
                    that offer an even more potent alternative to their
                    four-wheeled rivals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The reasons powered two-wheelers dominate nations such as
                    India, Indonesia and Vietnam – with a combined population
                    over 1.75 billion – are simple: cars are unaffordable on
                    local wages, few urban homes have space to store them, and
                    warm climates make two-wheelers viable year-round. Plus,
                    many of them sell for less than the equivalent of $1,000
                    apiece.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The industry has decided many will soon be electric and it
                    looks like drivers will buy them.

                    "Electrification of micromobility can be adopted at a faster
                    pace than cars, mainly because the motor and batteries are
                    much smaller," Fook Fah Yap, a director at Singapore's
                    Nanyang Technical University's Transport Research Centre
                    told <i>The Register</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Evidence of the shift is not hard to find. Earlier this year
                    Honda announced it will start to sell 10 battery-powered
                    bikes in 2025. Yamaha expects 90 percent of its sales will
                    be electrified by 2050 and Toyota is expected to announce an
                    electric two-wheeler this year.

                    [...] Two—wheelers, by contrast, are all about getting from
                    A to B, quickly and at low cost. Digital technology's role
                    in a two-wheeler is therefore all about information related
                    to navigation.

                    First discovered 60 years ago, quasars can shine as brightly
                    as a trillion stars packed into a volume the size of our
                    Solar System. In the decades since they were first observed,
                    it has remained a mystery what could trigger such powerful
                    activity. New work led by scientists at the Universities of
                    Sheffield and Hertfordshire has now revealed that it is a
                    consequence of galaxies crashing together.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The collisions were discovered when researchers, using deep
                    imaging observations from the Isaac Newton Telescope in La
                    Palma, observed the presence of distorted structures in the
                    outer regions of the galaxies that are home to quasars.
                  </p>

                    Most galaxies have supermassive black holes at their
                    centres. They also contain substantial amounts of gas – but
                    most of the time this gas is orbiting at large distances
                    from the galaxy centres, out of reach of the black holes.
                    Collisions between galaxies drive the gas towards the black
                    hole at the galaxy centre; just before the gas is consumed
                    by the black hole, it releases extraordinary amounts of
                    energy in the form of radiation, resulting in the
                    characteristic quasar brilliance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This is the first time that a sample of quasars of
                    this size has been imaged with this level of sensitivity. By
                    comparing observations of 48 quasars and their host galaxies
                    with images of over 100 non-quasar galaxies, researchers
                    concluded that galaxies hosting quasars are approximately
                    three times as likely to be interacting or colliding with
                    other galaxies.

                    The study has provided a significant step forward in our

              <p>
                Researchers have uncovered malicious firmware that can turn
                residential and small office routers into proxies for Chinese
                state-sponsored hackers. The firmware implant, discovered by
                Check Point Research, includes a full-featured backdoor that
                allows attackers to establish communication, issue commands, and
                perform file transfers with infected devices. The implant was
                found in TP-Link routers but could be modified to work on other
                router models.
              </p>
              <p>
                The malware's main purpose is to relay traffic between infected
                targets and command-and-control servers, obscuring the origins
                and destinations of the communication. The control
                infrastructure was traced back to hackers associated with the
                Chinese government. By using a chain of infected devices, the
                attackers can hide the final command and control and make it
                difficult for defenders to detect and respond to the attack.
              </p>
              <p>
                This technique of using routers and other IoT devices as proxies
                is a common tactic among threat actors. The researchers are
                unsure how the implant is installed on devices but suspect it
                could be through exploiting vulnerabilities or weak
                administrative credentials.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the firmware image discovered so far only affects TP-Link
                devices, the modular design allows the threat actors to create
                images for a wider range of hardware. The article concludes with
                recommendations for users to check for potential infections and
                apply proactive mitigations such as patching routers and using
                strong passwords.

                    The researchers further concluded that their analysis
                    supports the use of junk food taxes implemented as excise
                    taxes paid by manufacturers or distributors, rather than
                    sales taxes that need to be administered by retailers and

                    earmarked for particular uses, including improving access to
                    healthy food in low-resource communities.

                  <p>
                    "An advantage of excise taxes is that food companies may be
                    motivated to reformulate their products to be healthier to
                    avoid taxation," said study co-author Sean Cash of the
                    Friedman School at Tufts. "Defining foods to be taxed is not
                    a static exercise, as existing products are reformulated and
                    thousands of new packaged foods are introduced each year—so
                    how we tax foods is not just a tool for steering consumers
                    away from the least healthy options, but also for
                    encouraging healthy innovations in what ends up on the
                    supermarket shelves."

                    As zip and mov are now two generally approved TLDs, internet
                    services and mobile apps will be essentially forced to treat

                    URLs to open in a web browser. Cyber-criminals have already
                    started to exploit the new gTLDs, with a now-defunct
                    phishing page at "microsoft-office.zip" designed to try and

                    Trapped in the bio-oil, Charm Industrial thinks it can store
                    the CO2 underground for thousands to millions of years to
                    keep it from making climate change worse. That's how the
                    startup can now sell carbon removal credits, representing
                    tons of captured CO2, to companies that want to use its
                    service to try to cancel out some of its own carbon dioxide
                    pollution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So far, Charm has successfully stored more than 6,100 metric
                    tons of CO2 in the form of bio-oil. (A previous purchase
                    from Microsoft, at 2,000 metric tons of CO2, is a big chunk
                    of that.) So the deal announced today is a major escalation
                    and a vote of confidence from Big Tech companies that have
                    been early backers of the nascent carbon removal industry.

                  <p>
                    The advantage Charm says it has is that its plan is
                    decentralized. Other companies are building big plants to
                    suck carbon dioxide out of the

                    A key component of any processor is instruction decoding:
                    analyzing a numeric opcode and figuring out what actions
                    need to be taken. The Intel 8086 processor (1978) has a
                    complex instruction set, making instruction decoding a
                    challenge. The first step in decoding an 8086 instruction is
                    something called the Group Decode ROM, which categorizes
                    instructions into about 35 types that control how the
                    instruction is decoded and executed. For instance, the Group
                    Decode ROM determines if an instruction is executed in
                    hardware or in microcode. It also indicates how the
                    instruction is structured: if the instruction has a bit
                    specifying a byte or word operation, if the instruction has
                    a byte that specifies the addressing mode, and so forth.

                    [...] But Chinese chip specialists believe that despite
                    oversupply risks, domestic chipmakers should concentrate on
                    trailing nodes rather than on desperately investing in
                    sub-14nm and more advanced fabrication technologies.
                    Focusing on mature processes can lead to increased
                    self-sufficiency and controllability of the semiconductor
                    industry, reducing dependence on foreign technology and
                    supplies.

                  <p>
                    [...] Meanwhile, domestic suppliers of lithography tools can
                    make scanners with enough resolution for a 90nm-class node
                    and it is even unclear whether they can make them in
                    sufficient quantities. Therefore, Chinese chipmakers will
                    keep buying tools produced by companies from Japan and the
                    Netherlands. So while China's chip sector is striving for
                    autonomy, it will likely keep relying on WFE made abroad.

                    AI language model the ability to analyze an entire book's
                    worth of material in under a minute. This new ability comes
                    from expanding Claude's context window to 100,000 tokens, or
                    about 75,000 words.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like OpenAI's GPT-4, Claude is a large language model (LLM)
                    that works by predicting the next token in a sequence when
                    given a certain input. Tokens are fragments of words used to
                    simplify AI data processing, and a "context window" is
                    similar to short-term memory—how much human-provided input
                    data an LLM can process at once.<br />[...]<br />While it
                    may not sound impressive to pick out changes in a text
                    (Microsoft Word can do that, but only if it has two
                    documents to compare), consider that after feeding Claude
                    the text of The Great Gatsby, the AI model can then
                    interactively answer questions about it or analyze its
                    meaning. 100,000 tokens is a big upgrade for LLMs. By
                    comparison, OpenAI's
                    <a

                    >
                    LLM boasts context window lengths of 4,096 tokens (about
                    3,000 words) when used as part of ChatGPT and 8,192 or
                    32,768 tokens via the GPT-4 API (which is currently only
                    available via waitlist).<br />[...]<br />Notably, Anthropic
                    received a $300 million

                    But for Gates, A.I. isn't the type of technology you can

                    everyone else, you're probably hurting yourself," he told
                    ABC, adding that it is critical for the "good guys" to
                    develop more powerful A.I. systems.

                    The competitive nature of A.I. development means that a

              <p>
                A recent study challenges the idea that evolution always leads
                to increased complexity in animals. By analyzing gene
                arrangements on chromosomes, researchers sought to understand
                the evolutionary relationships between species.
              </p>
              <p>
                The study found that sponges, which lack muscles and a nervous
                system, are more closely related to humans than comb jellies,
                which possess both traits. This contradicts the assumption that
                complexity determines evolutionary proximity. The research
                suggests two potential explanations: either sponges and other
                simple animals lost nerves and muscles over time, simplifying
                their body plans, or nerves and muscles evolved independently in
                different lineages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further investigation, such as studying the nerve and muscle
                cells of comb jellies in a lab, is needed to differentiate
                between these possibilities. The study underscores the
                complexity of animal evolution and challenges existing notions
                of evolutionary relationships based on traits and complexity.

                    uncertainties in the global economy and the smartphone
                    industry, we have to make difficult adjustments for
                    long-term development. Therefore, the company has decided to
                    cease the operation of Zeku."

                    performance through machine learning, following Apple's path

                    [...] Oppo's retreat from chips signals another struggle
                    from Chinese phone companies to strengthen their control
                    over the semiconductor supply chain. Huawei lost access to
                    advanced chips from the U.S. due to Trump-era sanctions, and
                    its attempt to design its own high-end chips through
                    HiSilicon floundered after the U.S. cut it off major
                    foundries. The company resorted to

                Google to start deleting inactive personal email accounts. If
                your personal email account with Google have been inactive for

                    To reduce this risk, we are updating our inactivity policy
                    for Google Accounts to 2 years across our products. Starting

                Notice that they MAY delete the account and all the content.
                Weird that they say may instead of will. Will some of them be
                kept around anyway? Are they saving the content but deleting the
                account? Is it so the Google AI can have one long good snoop
                before it goes into dev/null?

                I might have missed it but to delete accounts for security
                reasons, that seems to be the reason given, is by itself sort of
                a security issue. After all what stops someone from
                re-registering the names afterwards. Hope that whatever mail
                they had keeps on sending to the address. Or it can be used to
                recover account credentials with other services. Deleting in
                that regard seems bad if they do not also block re-registration
                of said emails for a very very long time. Most of them will be
                duds but if you automate the process you'll hit digital
                credentials gold eventually.

                "Powerful magnetic pulses applied to the scalp to stimulate the
                brain can bring fast relief to many severely depressed patients
                for whom standard treatments have failed. Yet it's been a
                mystery exactly how transcranial magnetic stimulation, as the
                treatment is known, changes the brain to dissipate depression.
                Now, research led by Stanford Medicine scientists has found that
                the treatment works by reversing the direction of abnormal brain
                signals."
              </p>
              <p>
                "When they analyzed fMRI data across the whole brain, one
                connection stood out. In the normal brain, the anterior insula,
                a region that integrates bodily sensations, sends signals to a
                region that governs emotions, the anterior cingulate cortex.
              </p>
              <p>
                "You could think of it as the anterior cingulate cortex
                receiving this information about the body—like heart rate or
                temperature—and then deciding how to feel on the basis of all
                these signals," Mitra said.
              </p>
              <p>
                In three-quarters of the participants with depression, however,
                the typical flow of activity was reversed: The anterior
                cingulate cortex sent signals to the anterior insula. The more
                severe the depression, the higher the proportion of signals that
                traveled the wrong way."
              </p>
              <p>
                "When depressed patients were treated with SNT, the flow of
                neural activity shifted to the normal direction within a week,
                coinciding with a lifting of their depression."

                    [...] Launched in Canada in 1994 as a fringe magazine, Vice
                    expanded around the world with youth-focused content and a
                    prominent social media presence. It endured several years of
                    financial troubles, however, as tech giants such as Google

                    To facilitate its sale, Vice filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
                    in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of
                    New York. If the application is approved, other parties will
                    be able to bid for the company. Credit bids enable creditors
                    to swap secured debt for company assets rather than pay
                    cash.

                    As a family of large language models (LLMs), PaLM 2 has been
                    trained on an enormous volume of data and does next-word
                    prediction, which outputs the most likely text after a
                    prompt input by humans. PaLM stands for "Pathways Language

                    Finding, cultivating, and bioengineering organisms that can
                    digest plastic not only aids in the removal of pollution,
                    but is now also big business. Several microorganisms that
                    can do this have already been found, but when their enzymes
                    that make this possible are applied at an industrial scale,
                    they typically only work at temperatures above 30°C. The
                    heating required means that industrial applications remain
                    costly to date, and aren't carbon-neutral. But there is a
                    possible solution to this problem: finding specialist
                    cold-adapted microbes whose enzymes work at lower
                    temperatures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Here we show that novel microbial taxa obtained from
                    the 'plastisphere' of alpine and arctic soils were able to
                    break down biodegradable plastics at 15°C," said first
                    author Dr Joel Rüthi, currently a guest scientist at WSL.
                    "These organisms could help to reduce the costs and
                    environmental burden of an enzymatic recycling process for
                    plastic."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] None of the strains were able to digest PE
                    [non-biodegradable polyethylene], even after 126 days of
                    incubation on these plastics. But 19 (56%) of strains,
                    including 11 fungi and eight bacteria, were able to digest
                    PUR [biodegradable polyester-polyurethane] at 15°C, while 14
                    fungi and three bacteria were able to digest the plastic
                    mixtures of PBAT [biodegradable polybutylene adipate
                    terephthalate] and PLA [biodegradable polylactic acid].
                    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and a fluorescence-based
                    assay confirmed that these strains were able to chop up the
                    PBAT and PLA polymers into smaller molecules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It was very surprising to us that we found that a large
                    fraction of the tested strains was able to degrade at least
                    one of the tested plastics," said Rüthi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The best performers were two uncharacterized fungal species
                    in the genera <em>Neodevriesia</em> and
                    <em>Lachnellula</em>: these were able to digest all of the
                    tested plastics except PE. The results also showed that the
                    ability to digest plastic depended on the culture medium for
                    most strains, with each strain reacting differently to each
                    of four media tested.

                    [...] The practice illustrates the fine line online services
                    often walk when attempting to protect end users from common
                    threats while also respecting privacy. As Brandt notes,
                    actively cracking a password-protected zip file feels
                    invasive. At the same time, this practice almost surely has
                    prevented large numbers of users from falling prey to social
                    engineering attacks attempting to infect their computers.

                    One other thing readers should remember: password-protected
                    zip files provide minimal assurance that content inside the
                    archives can't be read. As Beaumont noted, ZipCrypto, the
                    default means for encrypting zip files in Windows, is

                    The ruins of the ancient necropolis of Neapolis lie some 10
                    meters (about 33 feet) below modern-day Naples, Italy. But
                    the site is in a densely populated urban district, making it
                    challenging to undertake careful archaeological excavations
                    of those ruins. So a team of scientists turned to cosmic

                    There are many variations of muon imaging, but they all
                    typically involve gas-filled chambers. As muons zip through
                    the gas, they collide with the gas particles and emit a
                    telltale flash of light, which is recorded by the detector,
                    allowing scientists to calculate the particle's energy and
                    trajectory. It's similar to X-ray imaging or
                    ground-penetrating radar, except with naturally occurring
                    high-energy muons rather than X-rays or radio waves. That
                    higher energy makes it possible to image thick, dense
                    substances like the stones used to build pyramids. The
                    denser the imaged object, the more muons are blocked,
                    casting a telltale shadow. Hidden chambers would appear in
                    the final image because they blocked fewer particles.

                    Neapolis was a Hellenistic city in a hilly area rich in
                    volcanic tuff rock. That made it soft enough to sculpt out
                    tombs, worship spaces, or caves for housing. The necropolis
                    in what is now the Sanita district of Naples was one such
                    creation, used for burials from the late fourth century BCE
                    to early first century CE. The site was buried in sediment
                    over time by a series of natural disasters, most notably
                    flooding by the <em>lava dei vergini</em> ("lava of the
                    virgins"). Unlike the volcanic lava that famously engulfed
                    Pompeii, this "lava" was made up of mud and rocks that came
                    loose from the hills during heavy rains.

                    the presence of perchlorate salts, which have been detected
                    in the planet's soil and are generally considered to be
                    toxic for plants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team was able to simulate Martian soil using basaltic
                    rich soil mined from the Mojave Desert, called the Mojave
                    Mars Simulant, or MMS, which was developed by scientists
                    from NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The teams then grew three varieties of rice, including one
                    wild-type and two gene-edited lines with genetic mutations
                    that better enable them to respond to stress, such as
                    drought, sugar starvation or salinity. These varieties were
                    grown in the MMS, as well as a regular potted mix and a
                    hybrid of the two. While plants were able to grow in the
                    Martian simulant, they were not as developed as those grown
                    in the potting soil and hybrid mix. Replacing just a quarter
                    of the Martian simulant with potting soil resulted in
                    improved development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team also experimented with the amount of perchlorate in
                    the soil, finding that 3 grams per kilogram was the
                    threshold beyond which nothing would grow, while mutant
                    strains could still root in 1 gram per kilogram.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their findings suggest that there might be a way forward for
                    genetically modified rice to find purchase in Martian soil.

                    A dermatologist in New York City has reported the country's
                    first known cases of highly contagious ringworm infections
                    that are resistant to common anti-fungal treatments—and
                    caused by a newly emerging fungus that is rapidly
                    outstripping other infectious fungi around the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In February, the dermatologist reported two cases to health
                    officials in the state, which are described in

                    [...] Ringworm—aka tineas, dermatophytosis, jock itch, and
                    athlete's foot—is a superficial fungal infection of the skin
                    that causes red, itchy, sometimes scaly circular rashes.
                    There are more than 40 different species of fungi that can
                    cause the infection, which spreads from infected people and
                    animals and also lurks in environments and on common
                    household items, like towels. Ringworm is extremely common
                    and can strike anyone. Usually, it's treatable with
                    over-the-counter creams.

                    [...] While alarming, the identification of cases in the US
                    is not surprising. The fungus behind the infections is
                    <em>Trichophyton indotineae</em> (previously described as
                    <em>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</em> type VIII), which is a
                    newly emerging fungus globally. Though genetic studies date

                    causes of ringworm, and the pathogen has rapidly emerged in

                    [...] The rise of <em>T. indotineae</em> is linked to the
                    abuse of topical treatments that contain egregiously large
                    combinations of steroids and antifungal/antibacterial
                    agents, spurring the development of resistance. This is

                        The track and the rhythm has to be at the forefront if
                        you want to move people. As soon as you put the vocal up
                        at the forefront, the track loses its energy and its
                        immediacy and it becomes something else, which is why I
                        think it suits jazz or folk.

                      <p>
                        But the minute you do that on a pop song, you kind of
                        lose people in that connection to feel the energy of a
                        track ... It loses a kind of visceral immediacy that
                        people are conditioned to, and it will make the song
                        kind of feel a little dull.

                        So now we're in this kind of arms race of audio and
                        sound and volume to get these tracks louder and louder.
                        So, yeah, now I think we're at a point where, for the
                        most part, it's the beat, a little bit of vocal, and
                        maybe one little element of music in there. You know,
                        this is a long way from the world of [The Beatles']
                        <em>Sgt. Peppers</em>, where there are orchestras and
                        sitars and a million other sonic colors happening.

                    In a first among United States automakers, Tesla will begin
                    refining its own lithium, a critical material for electric

                    The company broke ground on a $375 million lithium refining
                    plant in Corpus Christi, Texas, this week, which CEO Elon
                    Musk said will process enough lithium for 1 million vehicles

                    to help address this gap in domestic battery manufacturing.
                    The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law last August,
                    also adjusted the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit so that eligible
                    vehicles must meet certain battery sourcing requirements,
                    with materials largely coming from the U.S. or

                    Tesla processing its own lithium will help ensure the
                    company's vehicles qualify for those credits and will
                    protect it from supply chain fluctuations and geopolitical
                    disruptions. While it is the only U.S. automaker with a plan
                    to refine its own lithium so far,

                  <p>
                    Tesla claims its refining process is more environmentally
                    friendly and will consume 20 percent less energy than
                    conventional methods. It will also produce less-toxic
                    byproducts that could be repurposed in construction
                    materials, the company said. "We end up as a net
                    environmentally very neutral site," said Turner Caldwell,
                    senior manager of battery minerals and metals at Tesla. The
                    company estimates construction on the Texas plant will
                    conclude in 2025.

                  <p>
                    [...] Caldwell said that while the Texas facility's lithium
                    will originally come from hardrock mines, the process is
                    designed to be "feed flexible," meaning it could in the
                    future refine lithium from recycled sources, such as
                    manufacturing scrap and end-of-life batteries.

                    [...] Past genetics research has been criticized for relying
                    too heavily on DNA from people of European heritage.
                    Studying just one population of people could mean missing
                    genetic variants that have arisen in specific populations,
                    O'Connor says. "Having a pangenome reference allows us to
                    assess that population-specific variation in a much more
                    detailed way. And hopefully, that will then lead to greater
                    insight into the biology of everyone."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the pangenome is a great first step to better
                    represent all human genetic diversity, O'Connor says, "it
                    still is missing key groups in the world. It's still
                    underrepresenting Latin Americans and Indigenous Americans,
                    and ... there's nobody included from Oceania.... There's
                    still a lot more variation that needs to be added to the
                    pangenome to really, truly be representative of everyone."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Added diversity is coming, human geneticist Karen Miga of
                    the University of California, Santa Cruz said during a May 9
                    news conference. The consortium plans to complete a total of
                    350 genomes, including these 47, by mid-2024. The first
                    phase of the project was aimed at developing the technology
                    to build the pangenome.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Researchers hope the pangenome will help them more
                    easily diagnose the genetic changes that contribute to rare
                    diseases and find treatments for common disorders, he says.
                    Once that happens, clinicians may start incorporating data
                    from the pangenome in their practices.
