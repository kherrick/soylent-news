                    Where is the line between life and death? For centuries, it
                    was pretty clear. You stopped breathing, your heart stopped
                    beating, your brain shut down, it was off to the morgue.
                    Well, now the science is showing that the demarcation line
                    for crossing the River Styx may not be quite so clear cut.

                    tl;dr: Deep technical analysis of the CONTINUATION Flood: a
                    class of vulnerabilities within numerous HTTP/2 protocol
                    implementations. In many cases, it poses a more severe
                    threat compared to the Rapid Reset: a single machine (and in
                    certain instances, a mere single TCP connection or a handful
                    of frames) has the potential to disrupt server availability,
                    with consequences ranging from server crashes to substantial
                    performance degradation. Remarkably, requests that
                    constitute an attack are not visible in HTTP access logs. A
                    simplified security advisory and list of affected projects
                    can be found in: HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood.

                The total eclipse will begin on Monday April 8 in North America
                in about two hours from when this story posts. Millions of
                people live in the path of totality and it will pass over some
                major metropolitan cities. Possible topics could be:<br />+ Were
                you in the path of totality?<br />+ Did you have to travel to
                get there?<br />+ Was it clear (in my area the forecast is for
                "partly sunny"--not too promising).<br />+ Your observations of
                the event itself -- personal, professional, previous solar
                eclipses you have witnessed, etc.
              </p>

                    The Washington State Lottery has taken down a promotional
                    AI-powered web app after a local mother reported that the
                    site generated an image with her face on the body of a
                    topless woman.

                    [...] To test the device, Huang and colleagues used it to
                    measure the tiny variations in the force of gravity caused
                    by the apparent motion of the Sun and the Moon, the same
                    variations that cause the tides. After setting up their
                    device in a vacuum chamber, they waited several weeks for
                    conditions inside the device to stabilize before conducting
                    continuous measurements for five days. Their signal
                    displayed a series of oscillations representing variations
                    in the local gravitational acceleration of up to about 10−7
                    of the standard value (g, approximately 10 m/s2). The
                    results show a close correspondence between the predicted
                    gravitational variations and the experimental data. Overall,
                    says Huang, the gravimeter demonstrated a sensitivity
                    roughly 3 times better than small solid-state gravimeters,
                    with much higher stability.

                    The scourge of software supply chain attacks—an increasingly
                    common hacking technique that hides malicious code in a
                    widely used legitimate program—can take many forms. Hackers
                    can penetrate an update server to seed out their malware, or
                    even break into the network where the software was developed
                    to corrupt it at the source. Or, in the case of one
                    particularly insidious software supply chain attacker known
                    as Jia Tan, they can spend two years politely and
                    enthusiastically volunteering to help.

                  <p>
                    Over the weekend, the cybersecurity and open source software
                    community was shocked by the news that a relatively new,
                    experimental version of XZ Utils—a compression utility
                    integrated into many popular distributions of
                    Linux—contained a backdoor that would have allowed hackers
                    in possession of a specific private key to connect to the
                    backdoored system and run their own commands as an
                    administrator. Only some chance detective work carried out
                    by a lone Microsoft engineer, Andres Freund—who'd detected a
                    strange delay in how the remote connection protocol SSH was
                    running in a version of the Linux variant Debian—caught the
                    spy trick before it ended up in many millions of systems
                    worldwide.

                    Hail is a semi-frequent visitor to winter, and occasionally
                    summer, seasons across the globe and tends to pass by in a
                    short but sharp downpour that can often be overlooked.
                    However, sometimes these meteorological phenomena are hard
                    to ignore. This was the case on 30 August 2022, when Gerona,
                    north-eastern Spain, experienced a severe event in which
                    individual hailstones reached a massive 12cm—the largest
                    ever documented in the country. This led to serious damage
                    to buildings, cars and agricultural areas, as well as 67
                    injuries and one fatality.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Untangling the cause of this unusually extreme hail event is
                    at the heart of

                    published in <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i>. Professor
                    Maria Luisa Martin, of Universidad de Valladolid, Spain, and
                    colleagues investigated the role a record-breaking marine
                    heat wave had in exacerbating the hail storm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Iberian Peninsula experienced a sea surface temperature
                    increase of an average 3.27°C protracted over six weeks in
                    the summer of 2022, the highest on record. The research team
                    found that atmospheric convective energy reached
                    unprecedented levels, thus alongside moisture from a warm
                    ocean, enhanced supercell (storms with vertical rotation of
                    rising air currents) development in the Pyrenees, leading to
                    the meteorological phenomenon of hail.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To explore this further, the scientists used a dataset of
                    &gt;280 documented supercells from 2011 to 2022 (with 57
                    citing large hailstones &gt;5cm diameter, and four giant
                    hailstone events where they exceed 10cm diameter) to
                    simulate the hail event both with and without the influence
                    of a marine heat wave in the Mediterranean Sea. Increased
                    sea surface temperature is known to be one of many
                    consequences of global warming, and it has a direct impact
                    on the frequency and intensity of prolonged (&gt;5 days)
                    heat wave events.

                    [...] This research is important as it is a cautionary tale
                    of how continued climate change will not only increase the
                    likelihood of marine heat waves, but also other elements of
                    Earth's interconnected cycles. Consequently, there may be
                    more unforeseen meteorological events to come, with alarming
                    environmental, social and economic impacts.

                    [...] The macaques that roam Lopburi are a symbol of local
                    culture, and a major tourist draw. But after years of
                    dangerous encounters with residents and visitors and several
                    failed attempts to bring peace with population controls,
                    local people and businesses have had enough.

                    The monkeys frequently try to snatch food from humans,
                    sometimes resulting in tussles that can leave people with
                    scratches and other injuries. But outrage grew in March when
                    a woman dislocated her knee after a monkey pulled her off
                    her feet in an effort to grab food, and another man was
                    knocked off a motorcycle by a hungry monkey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Authorities hope to round up some 2,500 urban monkeys and
                    place them in massive enclosures, said Athapol
                    Charoenshunsa, the director-general of the Department of
                    National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation. They'll
                    work with wildlife experts to find a way for a limited
                    number of monkeys to stay at liberty in the city, he added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Previous control measure have fallen short. From
                    2014-2023, the wildlife authorities neutered about 2,600
                    Lopburi monkeys.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Athapol said they are also working in other areas of
                    Thailand that are facing problems with monkeys, such as
                    Prajuab Kiri Khan and Phetchaburi. He said 52 of the
                    country's 77 provinces report frequent problems from
                    monkeys.

                    This week, the White House officially tasked NASA with
                    establishing a time standard for the moon, called
                    Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC) in the Office of the

                    the same time—how disruptive that might be and how
                    challenging everyday things become," an unnamed White House
                    Office of Science and Technology Policy official tells
                    Reuters' Joey Roulette and Will Dunham.

                Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of
                Alberta (U of A) in Canada have examined whether attaching a
                condor-inspired winglet to a wind turbine blade can also reduce
                drag and increase energy production.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Wind turbine blades use aerodynamics to extract the wind's
                    energy, which is converted to electricity. But ensuring that
                    they produce as much energy as possible is necessary if
                    we're to rely on clean, sustainable energy production.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What commonly reduces the efficiency of wind turbines is
                    induced drag, created as a result of lift. As a blade passes
                    through the air, an area of lower air pressure is formed on
                    top of it (the suction side). Higher-pressure air below the
                    blade (the pressure side) seeks equilibrium with the
                    lower-pressure area above, resulting in tip vortices, air
                    that trails off the blade tips in spirals. The vortices
                    deflect airflow downward (downwash), creating induced drag.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While most modern airplanes reduce induced drag by using
                    winglets to minimize the effect of tip vortices, their use
                    in the wind industry is still in its infancy. Studies into
                    wind turbines with winglets have noted a boost in power
                    production but often at the cost of extending the blade tip,
                    making it difficult to ascertain whether the improvement is
                    directly attributable to the winglet or an increase in the
                    blade's wetted area, the area in contact with external
                    airflow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To clarify the issue, the U of A researchers turned to
                    <a href="https://www.biome-renewables.com/"
                      >Biome Renewables</a
                    >, a Canadian industrial design firm that creates clean
                    energy products by

                    and has designed winglets based on condor wings. Biome
                    developed its bio-inspired winglet for 'Project Condor.'
                    It's 17.6 ft (5.35 m) long and designed to be retrofitted to
                    a wind turbine's blade wingtip after production.[...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found that adding the winglet increased the pressure
                    difference between the suction surface and pressure surface
                    along the blade's span, which in turn increased the
                    turbine's torque (rotational force around an axis) and power
                    production. The average increase in energy production was
                    10%, which the researchers concluded was attributable to the
                    aerodynamic changes caused by the winglet and not just an
                    increase in the blade's swept area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To sum up, the results of the wake study and the power
                    production suggest that this bio-inspired design can
                    increase the power output of the wind turbines," said the
                    researchers.

                    The US and UK have agreed to work together to develop common
                    testing approaches for AI models, with safety being a key
                    focus.

                    The signed memorandum of understanding will see the AI
                    safety institutes of the US and the UK work “seamlessly”
                    with each other on research, safety evaluations and guidance
                    for AI safety. The institutes will cooperate and share
                    information to develop shared capabilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The US Department of Commerce said both countries will align
                    their scientific approaches and create robust suites of
                    evaluations for AI models, in order to deal with the risks
                    associated with this technology.

                  <p>
                    The two safety institutes plan to perform at least one joint
                    testing exercise on a publicly accessible model, as part of
                    their plans to make a common approach to AI safety testing.
                    These institutes also plan to combine their expertise by
                    exchanging personnel between the two organisations.

                  <p>

                    Japan's Space Exploration Agency (JAXA) late last week
                    revealed that its Moon lander had – somewhat unexpectedly –
                    mostly survived a second lunar night and was briefly well
                    enough to send home some snaps.

                    on January 19 – a feat that made Japan just the fifth nation
                    to reach Earth's sole natural satellite.

                  <p>
                    But the mission was declared only a "minimum success"
                    because, while SLIM's autonomous precision landing system
                    worked, the craft tipped onto its side with its solar panels
                    pointed in a sub-optimal direction. The lander managed to
                    unload its pair of tiny experimental rovers and

                    of the Moon, but the poorer-than-expected solar energy
                    production meant it could not perform some planned tasks and
                    it was put to sleep.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    SLIM in late February after it unexpectedly survived a
                    terrifyingly cold lunar night.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On March 27, JAXA pinged SLIM just in case, and was pleased
                    that it responded – like when you try friending your high
                    school crush on Facebook.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The SLIM control room is normally calm and collected no
                    matter what happens, but the moment SLIM responded, it was
                    filled with loud cheers," reads a

                  <p>
                    [...] Other data sent home revealed that some of SLIM's
                    temperature sensors and unused battery cells are starting to
                    malfunction, but the majority of functions that survived the
                    first lunar night were still operational.

                  <p>
                    JAXA continued to test SLIM on the night of March 29, by
                    "turning on switches and applying loads." But on the 30th
                    the lander again entered a dormant state and the space
                    agency’s crew tried to understand the state of the machine.

                    Walk Out. The technology allows customers to skip checkout
                    altogether by scanning a QR code when they enter the store.
                    Though it seemed completely automated, Just Walk Out relied
                    on more than

                    to ensure accurate checkouts. The cashiers were simply moved
                    off-site, and they watched you as you shopped.

                    Instead, Amazon is moving towards Dash Carts, a scanner and
                    screen that's embedded in your shopping cart, allowing you
                    to checkout as you shop. These offer a more reliable
                    solution than Just Walk Out. Amazon Fresh stores will also
                    feature self check out counters from now on, for people who
                    aren't Amazon members.

                    Since interacting with humans can be difficult, we've put
                    together a guide to a few key prompting techniques that will
                    help you get the most out of conversations with human
                    language models. But first, let's go over some of what HLMs
                    can do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Humans are complex and unpredictable models, so even
                    the most carefully crafted prompts can sometimes lead to
                    surprising outputs. Be patient, iterative, and open to
                    feedback from the person as you work to fine-tune your human
                    prompting skills. With practice, you'll be able to generate
                    the desired responses from people while also respecting
                    personal boundaries.

                    The technical aspects of the research are daunting for all
                    but a handful of mathematicians worldwide. In a nutshell,
                    the outcome of the team's research is a handy periodic table
                    of primes, or the PTP, pointing the locations of prime
                    numbers. The research is available as a working paper in the
                    SSRN Electronic Journal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] More to the point, the PTP has major applications
                    today in areas such as cyber security. Primes are already a
                    fundamental part of encryption and cryptography, so this
                    breakthrough means data can be made much more secure if we
                    can predict prime numbers, Kuo explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This advance in prime number research stemmed from working
                    on systems reliability design and a color coding system that
                    uses prime numbers to enable efficient encoding and more
                    effective color compression. During their research, the team
                    discovered that their calculations could be used to predict
                    prime numbers.

                    For the first time, scientists have built a fusion
                    experiment using permanent magnets, a technique that could
                    show a simple way to build future devices for less cost and
                    allow researchers to test new concepts for future fusion
                    power plants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE)
                    Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) combined decades
                    of expertise in engineering, computation and theoretical
                    physics to design a new type of stellarator, a twisty
                    machine that confines plasma, the electrically charged
                    fourth state of matter, to harness the fusion process that
                    powers the sun and stars and potentially generate clean
                    electricity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Using permanent magnets is a completely new way to design
                    stellarators," said Tony Qian, a graduate student in the
                    Princeton Program in Plasma Physics, which is based at PPPL.
                    Qian was the lead author of papers published in the Journal
                    of Plasma Physics and Nuclear Fusion that detail the theory
                    and engineering behind the device, known as MUSE. "This
                    technique allows us to test new plasma confinement ideas
                    quickly and build new devices easily."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "MUSE is largely constructed with commercially
                    available parts," said Michael Zarnstorff, a senior research
                    physicist at PPPL and principal investigator of the project.
                    "By working with 3D-printing companies and magnet suppliers,
                    we can shop around and buy the precision we need instead of
                    making it ourselves."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The original insight that permanent magnets could be the
                    foundation for a new, more affordable stellarator variety
                    came to Zarnstorff in 2014. "I realized that even if they
                    were situated alongside other magnets, rare-earth permanent
                    magnets could generate and maintain the magnetic fields
                    necessary to confine the plasma so fusion reactions can
                    occur," Zarnstorff said, "and that's the property that makes
                    this technique work."

                    competitors is that we're just very open. And we believe in
                    the community and the collaboration. And that's just one of
                    those examples of us doing that. And we want people to be
                    able to optimize the software, and to get the maximum out of
                    our hardware."

                    Intel's Developer Cloud is intended to give devs access to
                    its latest hardware, usually a good few months before its
                    rivals in the cloud space can get their hands on the
                    silicon. However, there is no escaping from the fact that
                    Intel trails the cloud giants in datacenter provision by
                    some distance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Has Intel done enough to persuade developers to use
                    its cloud rather than those of its rivals? Unsurprisingly,
                    Flierl reckons that the flexibility, with everything from
                    bare-metal Xeons through to managed Kubernetes, makes the
                    service a tempting choice.

                    [...] The shooting was caught on cellphone video, and his
                    lawyers wanted to enhance the video. They asked a video
                    production editor to use software that can "supercharge"
                    video, NBC News reported.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The prosecutor's office said the video enhanced images that
                    were "inaccurate, misleading, and unreliable." Experts said
                    the software is meant to make video more visually appealing
                    but may not reflect the truth.

                    The ruling comes as lawmakers across the country contend
                    with the emerging capabilities and accessibility of AI

                    its first government-wide policy that hopes to mitigate the
                    risks of AI.

                    Perusing the site, it’s immediately noticeable that lots of
                    the DNA-based speculations look very little like the person
                    arrested or charged. But that’s not really all that
                    problematic. Parabon’s “snapshots” aren’t meant to be
                    definitive descriptions of criminal suspects. They’re simply
                    meant to contribute to ongoing investigations by giving cops
                    something to post or hand out when asking people if they’ve

                    Sure, there’s always a chance this may result in a wrongful
                    arrest or detention, but the company makes it clear these
                    are nothing more than a best guess based on DNA profiles.
                    It’s not great, but it’s not Parabon’s fault if cops decide
                    to go a step or two further than the purpose for which these
                    “snapshots” were intended.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That’s on the cops themselves. Parbon does not encourage
                    this sort of use of its DNA snapshots. But cops who
                    apparently have zero concern about adding AI speculation to
                    AI speculation to engage in investigations are making things
                    demonstrably worse by using Paragon’s “snapshots” for
                    reasons they were never intended. Wrong + wrong never equals
                    right.

                    In contrast to the grand spiral structure of our Milky Way,
                    these first galaxies exhibit irregular shapes without
                    rotational support. Within their central regions, a few
                    hundred to a few thousand second-generation stars (Pop II
                    stars) can form. The metallicity of the gas in the first
                    galaxies has been enriched to about 0.01 solar metallicity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The simulations also suggest that the first stars were not a
                    predominant component of most first galaxies, as gas in
                    massive halos was typically polluted by metals from other
                    Pop III supernovae during hierarchical assembly before
                    collapsing into pristine stars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These first galaxies are considered the landmark of the
                    cosmic dawn, and their direct detection in the universe is a
                    significant goal for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
                    and upcoming 30-meter-class ground-based telescopes. This
                    finding provides a bridge between the demise of the first
                    stars and the emergence of the first galaxies, offering
                    valuable insights into the physics of the cosmic dawn.

                    A few weeks ago, something from the heavens came crashing
                    through the roof of Alejandro Otero's home, and NASA is on
                    the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In all likelihood, this nearly two-pound object came from
                    the International Space Station. Otero said it tore through
                    the roof and both floors of his two-story house in Naples,
                    Florida.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Otero wasn't home at the time, but his son was there. A Nest
                    home security camera captured the sound of the crash at 2:34
                    pm local time (19:34 UTC) on March 8. That's an important
                    piece of information because it is a close match for the
                    time—2:29 pm EST (19:29 UTC)—that US Space Command recorded
                    the reentry of a piece of space debris from the space
                    station. At that time, the object was on a path over the
                    Gulf of Mexico, heading toward southwest Florida.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This space junk consisted of depleted batteries from the
                    ISS, attached to a cargo pallet that was originally supposed
                    to come back to Earth in a controlled manner. But a series
                    of delays meant this cargo pallet missed its ride back to
                    Earth, so NASA jettisoned the batteries from the space
                    station in 2021 to head for an unguided reentry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] If the object is owned by NASA, Otero or his insurance
                    company could make a claim against the federal government
                    under the Federal Tort Claims Act, according to Michelle
                    Hanlon, executive director of the Center for Air and Space
                    Law at the University of Mississippi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It gets more interesting if this material is discovered to
                    be not originally from the United States," she told Ars. "If
                    it is a human-made space object which was launched into
                    space by another country, which caused damage on Earth, that
                    country would be absolutely liable to the homeowner for the
                    damage caused."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This could be an issue in this case. The batteries were
                    owned by NASA, but they were attached to a pallet structure
                    launched by Japan's space agency.

                    That appears to be good news for Slack, Zoom, and others
                    that are looking to lure Microsoft customers to their own
                    collaboration apps. However, Google told us last year that
                    Microsoft's concession of unbundling Teams from Office 365
                    in the EEA was "<a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/15/google_exec_microsoft_teams_concession/"
                      >too little, too late</a
                    >" as the tool had already amassed million of users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Coalition for Fair Software, a lobby group believed to
                    be backed by Google and AWS, pointed out that the change
                    made to Teams by Microsoft comes amid growing interest from
                    competition regulators in the vendor's wider licensing
                    policies with regard to
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/21/google_ftc_microsoft_anticompetitive_cloud/"

                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a statement, executive director Ryan Triplette, said: "By
                    simply extending the changes offered in Europe in August
                    2023, this announcement pays lip service to fair competition
                    but leaves interoperability and licensing restrictions in
                    place that prevent true customer choice. Despite the
                    shortcomings of the terms, they demonstrate that Microsoft
                    is capable of making changes when held accountable by
                    regulators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Microsoft's restrictive software licensing practices extend
                    well beyond Teams and are used to drive up costs and lock in
                    customers to their products throughout the cloud stack, from
                    Azure to security offerings. We urge all regulators,
                    including the US Federal Trade Commission, to take action to
                    address these practices and improve consumer choice."

                  <p>
                    Several big businesses have published source code that
                    incorporates a software package previously hallucinated by
                    generative AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not only that but someone, having spotted this reoccurring
                    hallucination, had turned that made-up dependency into a
                    real one, which was subsequently downloaded and installed
                    thousands of times by developers as a result of the AI's bad
                    advice, we've learned. If the package was laced with actual
                    malware, rather than being a benign test, the results could
                    have been disastrous.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Bar Lanyado, security researcher at Lasso
                    Security, one of the businesses fooled by AI into
                    incorporating the package is Alibaba, which at the time of
                    writing still includes a
                    <a
                      href="https://github.com/alibaba/GraphTranslator/blame/87ed496ab793180cd9d4183459b57ff6f6c3b5a0/README.md#L48"

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is a legit huggingface-cli, installed using pip
                    install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the
                    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/huggingface-cli/"
                      >huggingface-cli</a
                    >
                    distributed via the Python Package Index (PyPI) and required
                    by Alibaba's GraphTranslator – installed using pip install
                    huggingface-cli – is fake, imagined by AI and turned real by
                    Lanyado as an experiment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He created huggingface-cli in December after seeing it
                    repeatedly hallucinated by generative AI; by February this
                    year, Alibaba was referring to it in GraphTranslator's
                    README instructions rather than the real Hugging Face CLI
                    tool.

                    is now well known and has caused no small amount of
                    embarrassment among attorneys unaware of this tendency. And
                    as it turns out, generative AI models will do the same for
                    software packages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] So far at least, this technique hasn't been used in an
                    actual attack that Lanyado is aware of.

                  <p>
                    "Besides our hallucinated package (our package is not
                    malicious it is just an example of how easy and dangerous it
                    could be to leverage this technique), I have yet to identify
                    an exploit of this attack technique by malicious actors," he
                    said. "It is important to note that it's complicated to
                    identify such an attack, as it doesn't leave a lot of
                    footsteps."

                    A flat sheet of atoms can act as a kind of antenna that
                    absorbs light and funnels its energy into carbon nanotubes,
                    making them glow brightly. This advance could aid the
                    development of tiny future light-emitting devices that will
                    exploit quantum effects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Carbon nanotubes resemble very thin, hollow wires with a
                    diameter of just a nanometer or so. They can generate light
                    in various ways. For example, a laser pulse can excite
                    negatively charged electrons within the material, leaving
                    positively charged "holes." These opposite charges can pair
                    up to form an energetic state known as an exciton, which may
                    travel relatively far along a nanotube before releasing its
                    energy as light.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In principle, this phenomenon could be exploited to make
                    highly efficient nanoscale light-emitting devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunately, there are three obstacles to using a laser to
                    generate excitons within carbon nanotubes. First, a laser
                    beam is typically 1,000 times wider than a nanotube, so very
                    little of its energy is actually absorbed by the material.
                    Second, the light waves must align perfectly with the
                    nanotube to deliver their energy effectively. Finally, the
                    electrons in a carbon nanotube can only absorb very specific
                    wavelengths of light.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To overcome these limitations, a team led by Yuichiro Kato
                    of the RIKEN Nanoscale Quantum Photonics Laboratory turned
                    to another class of nanomaterials, known as 2D materials.
                    These flat sheets are just a few atoms thick, but they can
                    be much wider than a laser beam, and are far better at
                    converting laser pulses into excitons.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers grew carbon nanotubes over a trench carved
                    from an insulating material. They then placed an atomically
                    thin flake of tungsten diselenide on top of the nanotubes.
                    When laser pulses hit this flake, they generated excitons
                    that moved into the nanotube and along its length, before
                    releasing light of a longer wavelength than the laser. It
                    took just one trillionth of a second for each exciton to
                    pass from the 2D material into the nanotube.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We hope to utilize this concept to develop photonic
                    and optoelectronic devices that are just a few atomic layers
                    thick," adds Kato. "If we can shrink them to the atomically
                    thin limit, we expect novel quantum effects to emerge, which
                    may become useful for future quantum technologies."

                    Google has agreed to delete "billions of data records" the
                    company collected while users browsed the web using
                    Incognito mode, according to

                    >
                    in San Francisco on Monday. The agreement, part of a
                    settlement in a class action lawsuit filed in 2020, caps off
                    years of disclosures about Google's practices that shed
                    light on how much data the tech giant siphons from its
                    users—even when they're in private-browsing mode.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under the terms of the settlement, Google must further
                    update the Incognito mode "splash page" that appears anytime
                    you open an Incognito mode Chrome window after

                      >previously updating it in January</a
                    >. The Incognito splash page will explicitly state that
                    Google collects data from third-party websites "regardless
                    of which browsing or browser mode you use," and stipulate
                    that "third-party sites and apps that integrate our services
                    may still share information with Google," among other
                    changes. Details about Google's private-browsing data
                    collection must also appear in the company's privacy policy.

                  <p>
                    [...] Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda says in a statement
                    that the company "is happy to delete old technical data that
                    was never associated with an individual and was never used
                    for any form of personalization." Castaneda also noted that
                    the company will now pay "zero" dollars as part of the
                    settlement after earlier facing a $5 billion penalty.

                  <p>
                    [...] The settlement's relief is strictly "injunctive,"
                    meaning its central purpose is to put an end to Google
                    activities that the plaintiffs claim are unlawful. The
                    settlement does not rule out any future claims—<a

                    >
                    that the plaintiffs' attorneys had filed at least 50 such
                    lawsuits in California on Monday—though the plaintiffs note
                    that monetary relief in privacy cases is far more difficult
                    to obtain. The important thing, the plaintiffs' lawyers
                    argue, is effecting changes at Google now that will provide
                    the greatest, immediate benefit to the largest number of
                    users.

                    Critics of Incognito, a staple of the Chrome browser since
                    2008, say that, at best, the protections it offers fall flat

                    feature fills people with a false sense of security, helping
                    companies like Google passively monitor millions of users
                    who've been duped into thinking they're browsing alone.

                    singing those lyrics is raw and plaintive, dipping into blue
                    notes. A lone acoustic guitar chugs behind it, punctuating
                    the vocal phrases with tasteful runs. But there's no human
                    behind the voice, no hands on that guitar. There is, in
                    fact, no guitar. In the space of 15 seconds, this credible,
                    even moving, blues song was generated by the latest AI model

                    in physics, envisions a billion people worldwide paying 10
                    bucks a month to create songs with Suno. The fact that music
                    listeners so vastly outnumber music-makers at the moment is
                    "so lopsided," he argues, seeing Suno as poised to fix that

                    "The idea of neutrino detection is you can't spoof it, you
                    can't shield it, you can't fake it. Neutrinos travel at
                    almost the speed of light, so they provide
                    near-instantaneous detection, even at distance. They offer a
                    unique signature of nuclear activity," said Orebi Gann, who
                    is also a faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National
                    Laboratory (Berkeley Lab).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If you're either a long way away or you've got a very weak
                    signature, then you need a big detector. And for a big
                    detector, you need liquid."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eos is a 10-meter-tall, 5-meter-wide cylinder filled with
                    water and an organic scintillator and surrounded by light
                    detectors three times more sensitive than those used in
                    physics experiments today. Eos's improved sensitivity and
                    higher resolution come from combining two of today's best
                    techniques for detecting neutrinos: scintillation and
                    Cherenkov emission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The improvements could be a game-changer for future neutrino
                    physics projects, such as the Deep Underground Neutrino
                    Experiment (DUNE) now being constructed in an abandoned gold
                    mine in Lead, South Dakota, to detect neutrinos emitted by a
                    particle accelerator at Fermi National Laboratory, 500 miles
                    away in Illinois. UC Berkeley and Berkeley Lab are members
                    of the DUNE collaboration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What we would ultimately like to build is a much bigger
                    detector called Theia," she said. "Theia is the Titan
                    goddess of light and Eos's mother in the pantheon of gods.
                    The ideal location for Theia is in that mine in South
                    Dakota, seeing those neutrinos from Fermilab."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It remains to be seen whether Theia—which would employ a
                    tank large enough to nearly swallow the Statue of
                    Liberty—will replace one of DUNE's four planned liquid argon
                    "far" detectors.

                The FBI spends "every day, all day long" interrogating people

                    Three FBI agents came to Abdeljawad's house and said that
                    they had been given "screenshots" of her posts by Facebook.
                    Her lawyer Hassan Shibly

                    Abdeljawad told agents that she didn't want to talk and

                    that she later confirmed with local police that the FBI
                    agents really were FBI agents.

                    "Facebook gave us a couple of screenshots of your account,"
                    one agent in a gray shirt said in the video.

                    [...] Shibly says that he doesn't know which Facebook post
                    caught the agents' attention, and that it was the first time
                    he had heard of Facebook's parent company, Meta,
                    preemptively reporting posts to law enforcement. Andy Stone,
                    a spokesman for Meta, and Kayla McCleery, a spokeswoman for
                    the FBI's Oklahoma City office, declined to comment.*

                  <p>
                    Meta's official policy is to hand over Facebook data to U.S.
                    law enforcement in response to a court order, a subpoena, a
                    search warrant, or an emergency situation involving
                    "imminent harm to a child or risk of death or serious
                    physical injury to any person." The company received 73,956
                    requests from U.S. law enforcement and handed over data
                    87.84 percent of the time in the first half of 2023,
                    according to the

                    following statement; "Every day, the FBI engages with

                    investigation based solely on First Amendment protected
                    activity. The FBI is committed to ensuring our activities

                    The netbsd-10 release branch is more than a year old now, so
                    it is high time the 10.0 release makes it to the front
                    stage. This matches the long time it took for the
                    development branch to get ready for branching, a lot of
                    development went into this new release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This also caused the release announcement to be one of the
                    longest we ever did.

                    AT&amp;T said it has begun notifying millions of customers
                    about the theft of personal data recently discovered online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The telecommunications giant said Saturday that a dataset
                    found on the "dark web" contains information such as Social
                    Security numbers for about 7.6 million current AT&amp;T
                    account holders and 65.4 million former account holders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company said it has already reset the passcodes of
                    current users and will be communicating with account holders
                    whose sensitive personal information was compromised.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is not known if the data "originated from AT&amp;T or one
                    of its vendors," the company said in a statement. The
                    compromised data is from 2019 or earlier and does not appear
                    to include financial information or call history, it said.
                    In addition to passcodes and Social Security numbers, it may
                    include email and mailing addresses, phone numbers and birth
                    dates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the data surfaced on a hacking forum nearly two weeks
                    ago, it closely resembles a similar data breach that
                    surfaced in 2021 but which AT&amp;T never acknowledged, said
                    cybersecurity researcher Troy Hunt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If they assess this and they made the wrong call on it, and
                    we've had a course of years pass without them being able to
                    notify impacted customers," then it's likely the company
                    will soon face class action lawsuits, said Hunt, founder of
                    an Australia-based website for warning people when their
                    personal information has been exposed.

                    While adults might be spending the weekend trying to
                    remember where they have hidden a hoard of Easter eggs, the
                    black-capped chickadee has no trouble recalling where its
                    treats are stashed. Now researchers have discovered why: the
                    diminutive birds create a barcode-like memory each time they
                    stash food.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Black-capped chickadees are known for tucking food away

                    up to 500,000 food items a year. But more remarkable still
                    is their reliability in finding the morsels again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now researchers say they have unpicked the mechanism behind
                    the feat.
                    <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.02.032"

                    >
                    scientists in the US report how they gave chickadees
                    sporadic access to sunflower seeds within an arena featuring
                    more than 120 locations where food could be stashed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The behaviour of the birds and the activity at each cache
                    site – be it the storage of food, retrieval of food or
                    checks on a stash – were recorded on video.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team used an implanted probe in the brain of each bird
                    to record the activity of neurons in its hippocampus – a
                    brain structure crucial for memory formation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results show that each time a bird stashed seeds, even
                    if it was in the same location, a different combination of
                    neurons fired in its hippocampus, resulting in a
                    barcode-like pattern of activity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The same "barcode" was observed when the morsel was
                    retrieved as for when it was cached.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The barcodes were distinct from place cells – neurons in the
                    hippocampus known to be involved in the formation of
                    memories involving specific locations. "The two overlapped
                    randomly so that neurons could be neither, either, or both,"
                    said Dr Selmaan Chettih of Columbia University's Zuckerman
                    Institute, first author of the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "These results suggest that the barcode represents a
                    specific episodic experience, unique in place and time in
                    the chickadee's life," the researchers report.

                    Radio communications play a key role in modern electronics,
                    but to a hobbyist, the underlying theory is hard to parse.
                    We get the general idea, of course: we know about
                    frequencies and can probably explain the difference between
                    amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. Yet, most of
                    us find it difficult to articulate what makes a good
                    antenna, or how a receiver can tune in to a specific
                    frequency and ignore everything else.

                    Dr. Marcin Glowacki, from the Curtin University node of the
                    International Center for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) in
                    Western Australia, led the research, which aimed to study
                    the star-forming gas in a single radio galaxy. Although the
                    team didn't find any star-forming gas in the galaxy they
                    were studying, Dr. Glowacki instead discovered other
                    galaxies while inspecting the data.

                  <p>
                    Dr. Glowacki said, "These three are particularly
                    interesting, as by studying the galaxies at other
                    wavelengths of light, we discovered the central galaxy is
                    forming many stars. It is likely stealing the gas from its
                    companion galaxies to fuel its star formation, which may
                    lead the other two to become inactive."

                Oregon is now the fourth state in the country to enact a "right
                to repair" law to make it easier for consumers and independent
                shops to fix electronic gear. With Gov. Tina Kotek's signing of
                Senate Bill 1596 on Thursday, manufacturers will be required to
                offer any necessary documentation, parts, tools or any device
                needed to repair electronic equipment at a "fair cost" and on
                "reasonable" terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bill takes effect in January. It was championed by state
                Sen. Janeen Sollman, D-Hillsboro, who first started pushing for
                the legislation in 2021. The minority of lawmakers who opposed
                the bill were Republican. The bill had wide support from small
                businesses and consumer advocates, including OSPIRG, a statewide
                public interest group. Only one major manufacturer opposed the
                bill – Apple. An Apple representative who testified against the
                bill said it would undermine the company's security efforts, a
                claim lawmakers questioned.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] Besides Oregon, Minnesota, New York and California have
                right to repair laws on technology. Massachusetts has approved a
                right to repair law on vehicles and Colorado has adopted one for
                wheelchairs and another for farmers.

                    Michael Moussalli, the owner of Se7enLeaf, said that the
                    cannabis raid has nearly destroyed his business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    American police have been seizing cannabis for decades, but
                    the tables were turned last week, when law enforcement in a
                    California city was forced to return hundreds of pounds of
                    cannabis to a pot distributor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Costa Mesa police officers returned the massive shipment of
                    cannabis last week to Se7enLeaf, a cannabis distributor in
                    the city, according to the Los Angeles Times. The
                    authorities had accused the company of illegally operating
                    and seized the cannabis in September of last year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Michael Moussalli, the owner of Se7enLeaf, told SFGATE that
                    he was happy to get his cannabis back after his attorneys
                    explained he was operating legally, but he still blamed the
                    city for taking it in the first place and delaying its
                    return.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The sad thing is once all this info was shared, there was
                    no apologies. There was only more aggression," Moussalli
                    said, referencing the city's attempt to further delay the
                    return of the products. "The police were not happy that no
                    charges were filed. The police were not happy that the
                    product was being returned."

                    I predicted the hot dog would either explode, or do pretty

                    Well, he was right—the hot dog wound up being a
                    <em>very effective loudspeaker</em>, transmitting the
                    audible sound with pretty high fidelity, at a volume around
                    that of a yelling human, maybe 80-100 dBa. (Next time we
                    attempt such an experiment, we may bring a dB meter and

                    With a modest number of components, 160 projects could
                    easily be built by inserting wires into the spring terminals
                    connected to each component. An included manual guided you
                    through each of the projects, introducing new concepts and
                    providing structure, while still offering some latitude of
                    freedom to tinker — <em>but</em>, crucially, not the
                    nearly-infinite amount of latitude available on modern
                    electronic marketplaces today. You are constrained by the

                    included project documentation (unless you invent your own),

                    Competing teams receive challenges based on real-world
                    software used in critical infrastructure systems. Bringing
                    on APRA-H as a partner will help ensure the competition
                    addresses critical flaws in healthcare. Plus, the research
                    agency has committed an additional $20 million in rewards
                    for the contest.

                    [...] While Carney can't give away too much about what the
                    contests will involve, one that's already been announced is
                    the Linux kernel challenge project [<a
                      href="https://aicyberchallenge.com/storage/2023/12/Request-for-Comments_Scoring-and-Exemplar-Preview_v1.0.pdf"

                    >]. "We know that the Linux operating system powers a lot of
                    the devices and systems in many – if not all – of our
                    critical infrastructure sectors," he said. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This example challenge reintroduces a real-life
                    vulnerability, CVE-2021-43267, in the Linux kernel's
                    Transparent Inter Process Communication (TIPC) subsystem,
                    which allows communication across clusters on a network. The
                    challenge vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow
                    flaw.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "And successes that we have against that challenge are
                    implicitly very representative of the software that we would
                    need to secure in these sectors at large," Carney said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "And then specific to healthcare, if we start looking at
                    medical devices, 60 percent of all medical devices run some
                    flavor of Linux operating system," he added. "So once again,
                    as competitors find and fix vulnerabilities in that example
                    challenge, that translates into real-world safety, and
                    better defended, safer systems."

                    University researchers have created a new archive of ancient

                  <p>
                    The record of ancient brains highlights the different
                    environments they can be saved in, ranging from the frozen
                    Arctic to deserts.

                  <p>
                    The collection of shrunken, discoloured samples was found
                    preserved in all manner of people including Egyptian and
                    Korean royalty as well as explorers and victims of war.

                  <p>
                    It gives researchers the chance to analyse the early
                    evolution of humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of the brains were up to 12,000 years old and found in
                    records dating back to the mid-17th century.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ancient human brains were found across a range of
                    different sites, including the shores of a lakebed in Stone
                    Age Sweden and the depths of an Iranian salt mine around 500
                    BC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Experts say preservation of soft tissue such as brains is
                    relatively rare in the geological record.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The findings, published in the Proceedings of the
                    Royal Society B, bring together the records of more than
                    4,000 preserved human brains from some two hundred sources,
                    across six continents.

                    The analyses revealed patterns in the environmental
                    conditions associated with different modes of preservation
                    through time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More than 1,300 of the human brains were the only soft
                    tissues preserved, prompting questions as to why the brain
                    may persist when other organs perish.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These brains also represent the oldest in the archive with
                    several dating to the last Ice Age.

                  <p>
                    Alexandra Morton-Hayward, lead author of the study, said:
                    "In the forensic field, it's well known that the brain is
                    one of the first organs to decompose after death yet this
                    huge archive clearly demonstrates that there are certain
                    circumstances in which it survives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Whether those circumstances are environmental, or related
                    to the brain's unique biochemistry, is the focus of our
                    ongoing and future work.
