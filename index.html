                    Since interacting with humans can be difficult, we've put
                    together a guide to a few key prompting techniques that will
                    help you get the most out of conversations with human
                    language models. But first, let's go over some of what HLMs
                    can do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Humans are complex and unpredictable models, so even
                    the most carefully crafted prompts can sometimes lead to
                    surprising outputs. Be patient, iterative, and open to
                    feedback from the person as you work to fine-tune your human
                    prompting skills. With practice, you'll be able to generate
                    the desired responses from people while also respecting
                    personal boundaries.

                    The technical aspects of the research are daunting for all
                    but a handful of mathematicians worldwide. In a nutshell,
                    the outcome of the team's research is a handy periodic table
                    of primes, or the PTP, pointing the locations of prime
                    numbers. The research is available as a working paper in the
                    SSRN Electronic Journal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] More to the point, the PTP has major applications
                    today in areas such as cyber security. Primes are already a
                    fundamental part of encryption and cryptography, so this
                    breakthrough means data can be made much more secure if we
                    can predict prime numbers, Kuo explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This advance in prime number research stemmed from working
                    on systems reliability design and a color coding system that
                    uses prime numbers to enable efficient encoding and more
                    effective color compression. During their research, the team
                    discovered that their calculations could be used to predict
                    prime numbers.

                    For the first time, scientists have built a fusion
                    experiment using permanent magnets, a technique that could
                    show a simple way to build future devices for less cost and
                    allow researchers to test new concepts for future fusion
                    power plants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE)
                    Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) combined decades
                    of expertise in engineering, computation and theoretical
                    physics to design a new type of stellarator, a twisty
                    machine that confines plasma, the electrically charged
                    fourth state of matter, to harness the fusion process that
                    powers the sun and stars and potentially generate clean
                    electricity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Using permanent magnets is a completely new way to design
                    stellarators," said Tony Qian, a graduate student in the
                    Princeton Program in Plasma Physics, which is based at PPPL.
                    Qian was the lead author of papers published in the Journal
                    of Plasma Physics and Nuclear Fusion that detail the theory
                    and engineering behind the device, known as MUSE. "This
                    technique allows us to test new plasma confinement ideas
                    quickly and build new devices easily."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "MUSE is largely constructed with commercially
                    available parts," said Michael Zarnstorff, a senior research
                    physicist at PPPL and principal investigator of the project.
                    "By working with 3D-printing companies and magnet suppliers,
                    we can shop around and buy the precision we need instead of
                    making it ourselves."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The original insight that permanent magnets could be the
                    foundation for a new, more affordable stellarator variety
                    came to Zarnstorff in 2014. "I realized that even if they
                    were situated alongside other magnets, rare-earth permanent
                    magnets could generate and maintain the magnetic fields
                    necessary to confine the plasma so fusion reactions can
                    occur," Zarnstorff said, "and that's the property that makes
                    this technique work."

                    bottlenecks in code and, therefore, make apps more

                    difference in approach that we have compared to some of our
                    competitors is that we're just very open. And we believe in
                    the community and the collaboration. And that's just one of
                    those examples of us doing that. And we want people to be
                    able to optimize the software, and to get the maximum out of
                    our hardware."

                    Intel's Developer Cloud is intended to give devs access to
                    its latest hardware, usually a good few months before its
                    rivals in the cloud space can get their hands on the
                    silicon. However, there is no escaping from the fact that
                    Intel trails the cloud giants in datacenter provision by
                    some distance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Has Intel done enough to persuade developers to use
                    its cloud rather than those of its rivals? Unsurprisingly,
                    Flierl reckons that the flexibility, with everything from
                    bare-metal Xeons through to managed Kubernetes, makes the
                    service a tempting choice.

                    there's no legal precedent for using the technology in
                    court, the outlet reported.

                    Puloka has claimed self-defense after he was charged in the
                    Sept. 26, 2021, killings after he opened fire in a bar near
                    Seattle. He

                    three people and wounded two at the La Familia Sports Pub
                    and Lounge in Des Moines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The shooting was caught on cellphone video, and his
                    lawyers wanted to enhance the video. They asked a video
                    production editor to use software that can "supercharge"
                    video, NBC News reported.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The prosecutor's office said the video enhanced images that
                    were "inaccurate, misleading, and unreliable." Experts said
                    the software is meant to make video more visually appealing
                    but may not reflect the truth.

                  <p>
                    The ruling comes as lawmakers across the country contend
                    with the emerging capabilities and accessibility of AI
                    technology. Just last week, the White House

                    its first government-wide policy that hopes to mitigate the
                    risks of AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    a sweeping executive order on the technology, but

                    necessary as AI becomes more powerful and widely used.

                    the DNA-based speculations look very little like the person
                    arrested or charged. But that’s not really all that
                    problematic. Parabon’s “snapshots” aren’t meant to be
                    definitive descriptions of criminal suspects. They’re simply
                    meant to contribute to ongoing investigations by giving cops
                    something to post or hand out when asking people if they’ve
                    seen anyone resembling these speculative pictures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sure, there’s always a chance this may result in a wrongful
                    arrest or detention, but the company makes it clear these
                    are nothing more than a best guess based on DNA profiles.
                    It’s not great, but it’s not Parabon’s fault if cops decide
                    to go a step or two further than the purpose for which these
                    “snapshots” were intended.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That’s on the cops themselves. Parbon does not encourage
                    this sort of use of its DNA snapshots. But cops who
                    apparently have zero concern about adding AI speculation to
                    AI speculation to engage in investigations are making things
                    demonstrably worse by using Paragon’s “snapshots” for
                    reasons they were never intended. Wrong + wrong never equals
                    right.

                    In contrast to the grand spiral structure of our Milky Way,
                    these first galaxies exhibit irregular shapes without
                    rotational support. Within their central regions, a few
                    hundred to a few thousand second-generation stars (Pop II
                    stars) can form. The metallicity of the gas in the first
                    galaxies has been enriched to about 0.01 solar metallicity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The simulations also suggest that the first stars were not a
                    predominant component of most first galaxies, as gas in
                    massive halos was typically polluted by metals from other
                    Pop III supernovae during hierarchical assembly before
                    collapsing into pristine stars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These first galaxies are considered the landmark of the
                    cosmic dawn, and their direct detection in the universe is a
                    significant goal for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
                    and upcoming 30-meter-class ground-based telescopes. This
                    finding provides a bridge between the demise of the first
                    stars and the emergence of the first galaxies, offering
                    valuable insights into the physics of the cosmic dawn.

                    A few weeks ago, something from the heavens came crashing
                    through the roof of Alejandro Otero's home, and NASA is on
                    the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In all likelihood, this nearly two-pound object came from
                    the International Space Station. Otero said it tore through
                    the roof and both floors of his two-story house in Naples,
                    Florida.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Otero wasn't home at the time, but his son was there. A Nest
                    home security camera captured the sound of the crash at 2:34
                    pm local time (19:34 UTC) on March 8. That's an important
                    piece of information because it is a close match for the
                    time—2:29 pm EST (19:29 UTC)—that US Space Command recorded
                    the reentry of a piece of space debris from the space
                    station. At that time, the object was on a path over the
                    Gulf of Mexico, heading toward southwest Florida.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This space junk consisted of depleted batteries from the
                    ISS, attached to a cargo pallet that was originally supposed
                    to come back to Earth in a controlled manner. But a series
                    of delays meant this cargo pallet missed its ride back to
                    Earth, so NASA jettisoned the batteries from the space
                    station in 2021 to head for an unguided reentry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] If the object is owned by NASA, Otero or his insurance
                    company could make a claim against the federal government
                    under the Federal Tort Claims Act, according to Michelle
                    Hanlon, executive director of the Center for Air and Space
                    Law at the University of Mississippi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It gets more interesting if this material is discovered to
                    be not originally from the United States," she told Ars. "If
                    it is a human-made space object which was launched into
                    space by another country, which caused damage on Earth, that
                    country would be absolutely liable to the homeowner for the
                    damage caused."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This could be an issue in this case. The batteries were
                    owned by NASA, but they were attached to a pallet structure
                    launched by Japan's space agency.

                    that bundling Teams into Office 365 licenses was unfair,
                    leading to a European antitrust investigation.

                    [...] The move leaves users with the option to carry on as
                    normal, remove Teams from licenses and enjoy a small
                    discount, or buy it as a standalone product.

                    That appears to be good news for Slack, Zoom, and others
                    that are looking to lure Microsoft customers to their own
                    collaboration apps. However, Google told us last year that
                    Microsoft's concession of unbundling Teams from Office 365
                    in the EEA was "<a

                      >too little, too late</a
                    >" as the tool had already amassed million of users.

                    The Coalition for Fair Software, a lobby group believed to
                    be backed by Google and AWS, pointed out that the change
                    made to Teams by Microsoft comes amid growing interest from
                    competition regulators in the vendor's wider licensing
                    policies with regard to
                    <a

                  <p>
                    In a statement, executive director Ryan Triplette, said: "By
                    simply extending the changes offered in Europe in August
                    2023, this announcement pays lip service to fair competition
                    but leaves interoperability and licensing restrictions in
                    place that prevent true customer choice. Despite the
                    shortcomings of the terms, they demonstrate that Microsoft
                    is capable of making changes when held accountable by
                    regulators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Microsoft's restrictive software licensing practices extend
                    well beyond Teams and are used to drive up costs and lock in
                    customers to their products throughout the cloud stack, from
                    Azure to security offerings. We urge all regulators,
                    including the US Federal Trade Commission, to take action to
                    address these practices and improve consumer choice."

                    Several big businesses have published source code that
                    incorporates a software package previously hallucinated by
                    generative AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not only that but someone, having spotted this reoccurring
                    hallucination, had turned that made-up dependency into a
                    real one, which was subsequently downloaded and installed
                    thousands of times by developers as a result of the AI's bad
                    advice, we've learned. If the package was laced with actual
                    malware, rather than being a benign test, the results could
                    have been disastrous.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Bar Lanyado, security researcher at Lasso
                    Security, one of the businesses fooled by AI into
                    incorporating the package is Alibaba, which at the time of
                    writing still includes a
                    <a
                      href="https://github.com/alibaba/GraphTranslator/blame/87ed496ab793180cd9d4183459b57ff6f6c3b5a0/README.md#L48"

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is a legit huggingface-cli, installed using pip
                    install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the
                    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/huggingface-cli/"
                      >huggingface-cli</a
                    >
                    distributed via the Python Package Index (PyPI) and required
                    by Alibaba's GraphTranslator – installed using pip install
                    huggingface-cli – is fake, imagined by AI and turned real by
                    Lanyado as an experiment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He created huggingface-cli in December after seeing it
                    repeatedly hallucinated by generative AI; by February this
                    year, Alibaba was referring to it in GraphTranslator's
                    README instructions rather than the real Hugging Face CLI
                    tool.

                    is now well known and has caused no small amount of
                    embarrassment among attorneys unaware of this tendency. And
                    as it turns out, generative AI models will do the same for
                    software packages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] So far at least, this technique hasn't been used in an
                    actual attack that Lanyado is aware of.

                    "Besides our hallucinated package (our package is not
                    malicious it is just an example of how easy and dangerous it
                    could be to leverage this technique), I have yet to identify
                    an exploit of this attack technique by malicious actors," he
                    said. "It is important to note that it's complicated to
                    identify such an attack, as it doesn't leave a lot of
                    footsteps."

                    A flat sheet of atoms can act as a kind of antenna that
                    absorbs light and funnels its energy into carbon nanotubes,
                    making them glow brightly. This advance could aid the
                    development of tiny future light-emitting devices that will
                    exploit quantum effects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Carbon nanotubes resemble very thin, hollow wires with a
                    diameter of just a nanometer or so. They can generate light
                    in various ways. For example, a laser pulse can excite
                    negatively charged electrons within the material, leaving
                    positively charged "holes." These opposite charges can pair
                    up to form an energetic state known as an exciton, which may
                    travel relatively far along a nanotube before releasing its
                    energy as light.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In principle, this phenomenon could be exploited to make
                    highly efficient nanoscale light-emitting devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunately, there are three obstacles to using a laser to
                    generate excitons within carbon nanotubes. First, a laser
                    beam is typically 1,000 times wider than a nanotube, so very
                    little of its energy is actually absorbed by the material.
                    Second, the light waves must align perfectly with the
                    nanotube to deliver their energy effectively. Finally, the
                    electrons in a carbon nanotube can only absorb very specific
                    wavelengths of light.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To overcome these limitations, a team led by Yuichiro Kato
                    of the RIKEN Nanoscale Quantum Photonics Laboratory turned
                    to another class of nanomaterials, known as 2D materials.
                    These flat sheets are just a few atoms thick, but they can
                    be much wider than a laser beam, and are far better at
                    converting laser pulses into excitons.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers grew carbon nanotubes over a trench carved
                    from an insulating material. They then placed an atomically
                    thin flake of tungsten diselenide on top of the nanotubes.
                    When laser pulses hit this flake, they generated excitons
                    that moved into the nanotube and along its length, before
                    releasing light of a longer wavelength than the laser. It
                    took just one trillionth of a second for each exciton to
                    pass from the 2D material into the nanotube.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We hope to utilize this concept to develop photonic
                    and optoelectronic devices that are just a few atomic layers
                    thick," adds Kato. "If we can shrink them to the atomically
                    thin limit, we expect novel quantum effects to emerge, which
                    may become useful for future quantum technologies."

                    Google has agreed to delete "billions of data records" the
                    company collected while users browsed the web using
                    Incognito mode, according to

                    >
                    in San Francisco on Monday. The agreement, part of a
                    settlement in a class action lawsuit filed in 2020, caps off
                    years of disclosures about Google's practices that shed
                    light on how much data the tech giant siphons from its
                    users—even when they're in private-browsing mode.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under the terms of the settlement, Google must further
                    update the Incognito mode "splash page" that appears anytime
                    you open an Incognito mode Chrome window after

                      >previously updating it in January</a
                    >. The Incognito splash page will explicitly state that
                    Google collects data from third-party websites "regardless
                    of which browsing or browser mode you use," and stipulate
                    that "third-party sites and apps that integrate our services
                    may still share information with Google," among other
                    changes. Details about Google's private-browsing data
                    collection must also appear in the company's privacy policy.

                  <p>
                    [...] Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda says in a statement
                    that the company "is happy to delete old technical data that
                    was never associated with an individual and was never used
                    for any form of personalization." Castaneda also noted that
                    the company will now pay "zero" dollars as part of the
                    settlement after earlier facing a $5 billion penalty.

                  <p>
                    [...] The settlement's relief is strictly "injunctive,"
                    meaning its central purpose is to put an end to Google
                    activities that the plaintiffs claim are unlawful. The
                    settlement does not rule out any future claims—<a

                    >
                    that the plaintiffs' attorneys had filed at least 50 such
                    lawsuits in California on Monday—though the plaintiffs note
                    that monetary relief in privacy cases is far more difficult
                    to obtain. The important thing, the plaintiffs' lawyers
                    argue, is effecting changes at Google now that will provide
                    the greatest, immediate benefit to the largest number of
                    users.

                    Critics of Incognito, a staple of the Chrome browser since
                    2008, say that, at best, the protections it offers fall flat

                    feature fills people with a false sense of security, helping
                    companies like Google passively monitor millions of users
                    who've been duped into thinking they're browsing alone.

                    singing those lyrics is raw and plaintive, dipping into blue
                    notes. A lone acoustic guitar chugs behind it, punctuating
                    the vocal phrases with tasteful runs. But there's no human
                    behind the voice, no hands on that guitar. There is, in
                    fact, no guitar. In the space of 15 seconds, this credible,
                    even moving, blues song was generated by the latest AI model

                    in physics, envisions a billion people worldwide paying 10
                    bucks a month to create songs with Suno. The fact that music
                    listeners so vastly outnumber music-makers at the moment is
                    "so lopsided," he argues, seeing Suno as poised to fix that

                    "The idea of neutrino detection is you can't spoof it, you
                    can't shield it, you can't fake it. Neutrinos travel at
                    almost the speed of light, so they provide
                    near-instantaneous detection, even at distance. They offer a
                    unique signature of nuclear activity," said Orebi Gann, who
                    is also a faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National
                    Laboratory (Berkeley Lab).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If you're either a long way away or you've got a very weak
                    signature, then you need a big detector. And for a big
                    detector, you need liquid."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eos is a 10-meter-tall, 5-meter-wide cylinder filled with
                    water and an organic scintillator and surrounded by light
                    detectors three times more sensitive than those used in
                    physics experiments today. Eos's improved sensitivity and
                    higher resolution come from combining two of today's best
                    techniques for detecting neutrinos: scintillation and
                    Cherenkov emission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The improvements could be a game-changer for future neutrino
                    physics projects, such as the Deep Underground Neutrino
                    Experiment (DUNE) now being constructed in an abandoned gold
                    mine in Lead, South Dakota, to detect neutrinos emitted by a
                    particle accelerator at Fermi National Laboratory, 500 miles
                    away in Illinois. UC Berkeley and Berkeley Lab are members
                    of the DUNE collaboration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What we would ultimately like to build is a much bigger
                    detector called Theia," she said. "Theia is the Titan
                    goddess of light and Eos's mother in the pantheon of gods.
                    The ideal location for Theia is in that mine in South
                    Dakota, seeing those neutrinos from Fermilab."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It remains to be seen whether Theia—which would employ a
                    tank large enough to nearly swallow the Statue of
                    Liberty—will replace one of DUNE's four planned liquid argon
                    "far" detectors.

                    Abdeljawad told agents that she didn't want to talk and

                    "Facebook gave us a couple of screenshots of your account,"
                    one agent in a gray shirt said in the video.

                    caught the agents' attention, and that it was the first time
                    he had heard of Facebook's parent company, Meta,
                    preemptively reporting posts to law enforcement. Andy Stone,
                    a spokesman for Meta, and Kayla McCleery, a spokeswoman for
                    the FBI's Oklahoma City office, declined to comment.*

                  <p>
                    Meta's official policy is to hand over Facebook data to U.S.
                    law enforcement in response to a court order, a subpoena, a
                    search warrant, or an emergency situation involving
                    "imminent harm to a child or risk of death or serious
                    physical injury to any person." The company received 73,956
                    requests from U.S. law enforcement and handed over data
                    87.84 percent of the time in the first half of 2023,

                    The netbsd-10 release branch is more than a year old now, so
                    it is high time the 10.0 release makes it to the front
                    stage. This matches the long time it took for the
                    development branch to get ready for branching, a lot of
                    development went into this new release.

                  <p>
                    This also caused the release announcement to be one of the
                    longest we ever did.

                  <p>
                    AT&amp;T said it has begun notifying millions of customers
                    about the theft of personal data recently discovered online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The telecommunications giant said Saturday that a dataset
                    found on the "dark web" contains information such as Social
                    Security numbers for about 7.6 million current AT&amp;T
                    account holders and 65.4 million former account holders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company said it has already reset the passcodes of
                    current users and will be communicating with account holders
                    whose sensitive personal information was compromised.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is not known if the data "originated from AT&amp;T or one
                    of its vendors," the company said in a statement. The
                    compromised data is from 2019 or earlier and does not appear
                    to include financial information or call history, it said.
                    In addition to passcodes and Social Security numbers, it may
                    include email and mailing addresses, phone numbers and birth
                    dates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the data surfaced on a hacking forum nearly two weeks
                    ago, it closely resembles a similar data breach that
                    surfaced in 2021 but which AT&amp;T never acknowledged, said
                    cybersecurity researcher Troy Hunt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If they assess this and they made the wrong call on it, and
                    we've had a course of years pass without them being able to
                    notify impacted customers," then it's likely the company
                    will soon face class action lawsuits, said Hunt, founder of
                    an Australia-based website for warning people when their
                    personal information has been exposed.

                    While adults might be spending the weekend trying to
                    remember where they have hidden a hoard of Easter eggs, the
                    black-capped chickadee has no trouble recalling where its
                    treats are stashed. Now researchers have discovered why: the
                    diminutive birds create a barcode-like memory each time they
                    stash food.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Black-capped chickadees are known for tucking food away

                    up to 500,000 food items a year. But more remarkable still
                    is their reliability in finding the morsels again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now researchers say they have unpicked the mechanism behind
                    the feat.
                    <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.02.032"

                    >
                    scientists in the US report how they gave chickadees
                    sporadic access to sunflower seeds within an arena featuring
                    more than 120 locations where food could be stashed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The behaviour of the birds and the activity at each cache
                    site – be it the storage of food, retrieval of food or
                    checks on a stash – were recorded on video.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team used an implanted probe in the brain of each bird
                    to record the activity of neurons in its hippocampus – a
                    brain structure crucial for memory formation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results show that each time a bird stashed seeds, even
                    if it was in the same location, a different combination of
                    neurons fired in its hippocampus, resulting in a
                    barcode-like pattern of activity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The same "barcode" was observed when the morsel was
                    retrieved as for when it was cached.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The barcodes were distinct from place cells – neurons in the
                    hippocampus known to be involved in the formation of
                    memories involving specific locations. "The two overlapped
                    randomly so that neurons could be neither, either, or both,"
                    said Dr Selmaan Chettih of Columbia University's Zuckerman
                    Institute, first author of the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "These results suggest that the barcode represents a
                    specific episodic experience, unique in place and time in
                    the chickadee's life," the researchers report.

                    statement with three separate lists of CPUs, operating
                    systems and centralised database deemed "safe and reliable"
                    for three years after the publication date, all from Chinese
                    companies, Reuters checks showed.

                    Radio communications play a key role in modern electronics,
                    but to a hobbyist, the underlying theory is hard to parse.
                    We get the general idea, of course: we know about
                    frequencies and can probably explain the difference between
                    amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. Yet, most of
                    us find it difficult to articulate what makes a good
                    antenna, or how a receiver can tune in to a specific
                    frequency and ignore everything else.

                    An international team of astronomers has discovered 49 new

                    Dr. Marcin Glowacki, from the Curtin University node of the
                    International Center for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) in
                    Western Australia, led the research, which aimed to study
                    the star-forming gas in a single radio galaxy. Although the
                    team didn't find any star-forming gas in the galaxy they
                    were studying, Dr. Glowacki instead discovered other
                    galaxies while inspecting the data.

                  <p>
                    Dr. Glowacki said, "These three are particularly
                    interesting, as by studying the galaxies at other
                    wavelengths of light, we discovered the central galaxy is
                    forming many stars. It is likely stealing the gas from its
                    companion galaxies to fuel its star formation, which may
                    lead the other two to become inactive."

                Oregon is now the fourth state in the country to enact a "right
                to repair" law to make it easier for consumers and independent
                shops to fix electronic gear. With Gov. Tina Kotek's signing of
                Senate Bill 1596 on Thursday, manufacturers will be required to
                offer any necessary documentation, parts, tools or any device
                needed to repair electronic equipment at a "fair cost" and on
                "reasonable" terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bill takes effect in January. It was championed by state
                Sen. Janeen Sollman, D-Hillsboro, who first started pushing for
                the legislation in 2021. The minority of lawmakers who opposed
                the bill were Republican. The bill had wide support from small
                businesses and consumer advocates, including OSPIRG, a statewide
                public interest group. Only one major manufacturer opposed the
                bill – Apple. An Apple representative who testified against the
                bill said it would undermine the company's security efforts, a
                claim lawmakers questioned.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] Besides Oregon, Minnesota, New York and California have
                right to repair laws on technology. Massachusetts has approved a
                right to repair law on vehicles and Colorado has adopted one for
                wheelchairs and another for farmers.

                    Michael Moussalli, the owner of Se7enLeaf, said that the
                    cannabis raid has nearly destroyed his business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    American police have been seizing cannabis for decades, but
                    the tables were turned last week, when law enforcement in a
                    California city was forced to return hundreds of pounds of
                    cannabis to a pot distributor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Costa Mesa police officers returned the massive shipment of
                    cannabis last week to Se7enLeaf, a cannabis distributor in
                    the city, according to the Los Angeles Times. The
                    authorities had accused the company of illegally operating
                    and seized the cannabis in September of last year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Michael Moussalli, the owner of Se7enLeaf, told SFGATE that
                    he was happy to get his cannabis back after his attorneys
                    explained he was operating legally, but he still blamed the
                    city for taking it in the first place and delaying its
                    return.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The sad thing is once all this info was shared, there was
                    no apologies. There was only more aggression," Moussalli
                    said, referencing the city's attempt to further delay the
                    return of the products. "The police were not happy that no
                    charges were filed. The police were not happy that the
                    product was being returned."

                    I predicted the hot dog would either explode, or do pretty

                    Well, he was right—the hot dog wound up being a
                    <em>very effective loudspeaker</em>, transmitting the
                    audible sound with pretty high fidelity, at a volume around
                    that of a yelling human, maybe 80-100 dBa. (Next time we
                    attempt such an experiment, we may bring a dB meter and

                    With a modest number of components, 160 projects could
                    easily be built by inserting wires into the spring terminals
                    connected to each component. An included manual guided you
                    through each of the projects, introducing new concepts and
                    providing structure, while still offering some latitude of
                    freedom to tinker — <em>but</em>, crucially, not the
                    nearly-infinite amount of latitude available on modern
                    electronic marketplaces today. You are constrained by the
                    components in the kit (unless you add your own), and the
                    included project documentation (unless you invent your own),
                    a finite possibility.

                    Competing teams receive challenges based on real-world
                    software used in critical infrastructure systems. Bringing
                    on APRA-H as a partner will help ensure the competition
                    addresses critical flaws in healthcare. Plus, the research
                    agency has committed an additional $20 million in rewards
                    for the contest.

                    [...] While Carney can't give away too much about what the
                    contests will involve, one that's already been announced is
                    the Linux kernel challenge project [<a
                      href="https://aicyberchallenge.com/storage/2023/12/Request-for-Comments_Scoring-and-Exemplar-Preview_v1.0.pdf"

                    >]. "We know that the Linux operating system powers a lot of
                    the devices and systems in many – if not all – of our
                    critical infrastructure sectors," he said. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This example challenge reintroduces a real-life
                    vulnerability, CVE-2021-43267, in the Linux kernel's
                    Transparent Inter Process Communication (TIPC) subsystem,
                    which allows communication across clusters on a network. The
                    challenge vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow
                    flaw.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "And successes that we have against that challenge are
                    implicitly very representative of the software that we would
                    need to secure in these sectors at large," Carney said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "And then specific to healthcare, if we start looking at
                    medical devices, 60 percent of all medical devices run some
                    flavor of Linux operating system," he added. "So once again,
                    as competitors find and fix vulnerabilities in that example
                    challenge, that translates into real-world safety, and
                    better defended, safer systems."

                    University researchers have created a new archive of ancient

                    The record of ancient brains highlights the different
                    environments they can be saved in, ranging from the frozen
                    Arctic to deserts.

                    The collection of shrunken, discoloured samples was found
                    preserved in all manner of people including Egyptian and

                  <p>
                    Many of the brains were up to 12,000 years old and found in
                    records dating back to the mid-17th century.

                  <p>
                    The ancient human brains were found across a range of
                    different sites, including the shores of a lakebed in Stone
                    Age Sweden and the depths of an Iranian salt mine around 500

                    Experts say preservation of soft tissue such as brains is
                    relatively rare in the geological record.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The findings, published in the Proceedings of the
                    Royal Society B, bring together the records of more than
                    4,000 preserved human brains from some two hundred sources,
                    across six continents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The analyses revealed patterns in the environmental
                    conditions associated with different modes of preservation
                    through time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More than 1,300 of the human brains were the only soft
                    tissues preserved, prompting questions as to why the brain
                    may persist when other organs perish.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These brains also represent the oldest in the archive with
                    several dating to the last Ice Age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Alexandra Morton-Hayward, lead author of the study, said:
                    "In the forensic field, it's well known that the brain is
                    one of the first organs to decompose after death yet this
                    huge archive clearly demonstrates that there are certain
                    circumstances in which it survives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Whether those circumstances are environmental, or related
                    to the brain's unique biochemistry, is the focus of our
                    ongoing and future work.

                    According to YouTube channel Bellular Warcraft, World of
                    Warcraft currently has around 7.25 million subscribers.
                    While the game appears to have recovered from the disaster

                    expansion almost 10 years ago, it remains far from its peak
                    of 12 million in 2010 during

                  <p>
                    Subscriptions had been declining steadily since Cataclysm in
                    late 2010, when Draenor managed to boost them up to 10
                    million. Unfortunately, the spike was short-lived, and
                    Blizzard soon confirmed that WoW had plummeted to 5.5
                    million subscribers – the last hard number the company ever
                    released.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, sources recently provided Bellular Warcraft with
                    slides from the company's GDC 2024 postmortem, which
                    included a graph showing WoW subscription growth since 2016.
                    The only exact numbers on the chart are the years displayed
                    on the X-axis, but comments from Blizzard over the years
                    gave Bellular Warcraft just enough context to estimate the
                    real figures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An earnings report from the first quarter of 2017 mentioned
                    that the 2016 expansion, Legion, slightly surpassed its
                    immediate predecessor, Draenor. From there, Bellular
                    Warcraft estimated that the game had around 5.8 million
                    subscribers at that time. They arrived at the current number
                    of 7.25 million by counting the chart's pixels upward from
                    early 2017.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] After War for Azeroth sank subscriptions to
                    approximately 4.07 million, Classic bounced them back to
                    8.27 million. Then, the ensuing pandemic likely helped
                    sustain subscriber counts at a higher average compared to
                    the earlier trend of peaks and troughs. However, the
                    critically panned Shadowlands, which Blizzard's panel
                    admitted was badly executed, led to a collapse to 4.5
                    million in 2022. Subscriptions then recovered somewhat
                    leading to Dragonflight later that year, which missed
                    Blizzard's projections.

                    In extremely simplified terms, that means the camera uses a
                    computational imaging modality to capture spatial
                    information by letting light enter its sensor at slightly
                    different times. Not having to process the spatial data at
                    the moment is part of what frees the camera to capture those
                    extremely quick "chirped" laser pulses at up to 156.3
                    trillion times per second. The images' raw data can then be
                    processed by a computer algorithm that decodes the
                    time-staggered inputs, transforming each of the trillions of
                    frames into a complete picture.

                    Remarkably, it did so "using off-the-shelf and passive
                    optical components," as the paper describes. The team
                    describes SCARF as low-cost with low power consumption and
                    high measurement quality compared to existing techniques.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although SCARF is focused more on research than consumers,
                    the team is already working with two companies, Axis
                    Photonique and Few-Cycle, to develop commercial versions,
                    presumably for peers at other higher learning or scientific
                    institutions.

                  <p>
                    Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Monday signed a bill that
                    bans children aged under 14 from social media platforms and
                    requires 14- and 15-year-olds to get parental consent, a
                    measure supporters say will protect them from online risks
                    to their mental health.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The measure requires social media platforms to terminate the
                    accounts of people under 14 and those of people under 16 who
                    do not have parental consent. It requires them to use a
                    third-party verification system to screen out those who are
                    underage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The amended version allows for parents to provide consent
                    for older children to engage on social media platforms. It
                    will become law on Jan. 1, 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Social media harms children in a variety of ways,"
                    DeSantis said in a statement. He said the legislation "gives
                    parents a greater ability to protect their children."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Critics have said the bill violates the U.S.
                    Constitution's First Amendment protections for free speech
                    and that parents, not the government, should make decisions
                    about the online presence of their children of all ages.

                    main telescope optics, was heated from –147°C to –113°C. It
                    didn't need to get hot, because in a vacuum this temperature
                    is enough to quickly evaporate all the ice. And it worked
                    like a charm! Almost immediately, we were receiving 15% more
                    light from the universe. I was certain that we would see a
                    considerable improvement, but not in such a spectacular

                    With Euclid's vision cleared at the very first stage of the

                    precisely the ice had formed, and where it is likely to form
                    again. "Euclid's 'eye' has been cleared, allowing it to
                    clearly see faint light from distant galaxies, and more of
                    them than would otherwise be possible without this
                    operation," explains Reiko Nakajima, VIS instrument

                    decontamination procedure every six to 12 months and with
                    very little cost to science observations or the rest of the

                    In an interview on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor
                    ahead of Reddit's market debut on Thursday, chief executive
                    Steve Huffman acknowledged that the mischievous retail
                    investors that congregate on the social media platform might
                    deliberately drive down its share price.
                  </p>
                  <p>"It's a free market!" he said.</p>
                  <p>
                    For Reddit, as for Huffman, the bet on a public offering for
                    a site he described as a "fun and special, but sometimes
                    crazy place" has appeared to pay off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The chief executive sold 500,000 of his shares in the
                    IPO, cashing out a plump $17 million, and is due to receive
                    additional equity awards as a result of listing the company
                    above a $5 billion valuation. He also received an estimated
                    $193 million pay package last year, mostly made up of equity
                    awards, according to filings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Reddit, more so than many social media platforms, has
                    been a very community-based, non-commercial space and people
                    know and love it for [this]," said Samuel Woolley, a
                    propaganda expert and assistant professor at the University
                    of Texas at Austin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I think the big question that should be on everyone's mind
                    for Reddit is to what extent the IPO will change the very
                    nature and fabric of the platform."

                    If you enter "how to see the eclipse" into your favorite
                    search engine, you're bound to see thousands—millions?—of
                    helpful guides. Some of these are extremely detailed and
                    thorough, almost as if the author were getting paid by the
                    word or augmented by AI.

                    In reality, seeing a solar eclipse is just about the easiest
                    thing one can do in one's life. Like, it's difficult to
                    think of anything else that has the greatest reward-lowest
                    effort ratio in life. You just need to know a couple of
                    things. For the sake of simplicity, here is Ars' four-step
                    guide to having a four-star eclipse-viewing experience.
                    Steps are listed in order of ascending importance.

                    [...] In reality, a total solar eclipse is probably going to
                    be the most spectacular celestial event most of us see in
                    our lifetimes. Certainly, there could be more spectacular
                    ones. A supernova within 100 light-years of Earth would be
                    amazing. Witnessing a large asteroid streaking through
                    Earth's atmosphere before impact would be incredible.
                  </p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, those would also be lethal.</p>

                    Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are a promising alternative
                    to lithium–ion batteries (LiBs), the most common
                    rechargeable battery technology. As sulfur is abundant on
                    Earth, these batteries could be cheaper and more
                    environmentally friendly than LiBs, while also potentially
                    exhibiting higher energy densities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite these advantages, the deployment of Li–S batteries
                    has so far been limited, as many of these batteries also
                    have a low cycle life and a high self-discharge rate. In
                    addition, the predicted high energy density of Li–S
                    batteries often becomes far lower when in real applications,
                    due to the high rates at which they charge and discharge.

                    A chemical reaction that plays a central role in ensuring
                    the high capacity of Li–S batteries is the so-called sulfur
                    reduction reaction (SRR). This reaction has been widely
                    studied, yet its kinetic tendencies at high current rates
                    remain poorly understood.

                    Researchers at the University of Adelaide, Tianjin
                    University and Australian Synchrotron recently carried out a
                    study aimed at delineating the kinetic trend of SRR, to
                    inform the future development of high-power Li–S batteries.

                    introduces a nanocomposite carbon electrocatalyst that was
                    found to boost the performance of Li–S batteries, attaining
                    a discharge capacity retention of approximately 75%.

                  <p>
                    [...] Building on their observations, the researchers
                    already introduced one electrocatalyst that was found to
                    enhance the capacity retention and cyclic stability of an
                    Li–S battery. In the future, their work could inspire the
                    design of other promising catalysts, potentially
                    contributing to the development of new high-power Li–S

                    set and a test set. Once a model was trained on the data
                    within the training set, they evaluated its ability to

                    of a beer: people were more likely to rate a beer highly if
                    it contained these specific compounds. For example, the

                    "We had the models analyze these beers and then asked them
                    'How can we make these beers better?'" says Kevin
                    Verstrepen, a professor at KU Leuven and director of the
                    VIB-KU Leuven Center for Microbiology, who worked on the
                    project. "Then we went in and actually made those changes to
                    the beers by adding flavor compounds. And lo and behold—once
                    we did blind tastings, the beers became better, and more
                    generally appreciated."

                    A team of aroma chemists at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität
                    Erlangen-Nürnberg, working with psychologist colleagues from
                    the Technical University of Dresden, has uncovered the
                    reasons for the dissimilar smells between babies and
                    teenagers. The
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-024-01131-4"
                      >study</a

                    is published in the journal
                    <em>Communications Chemistry</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prior research and anecdotal evidence have shown that babies
                    have a pleasant smell, often described as sweet. Teenagers,
                    on the other hand, especially males, have often been
                    described as smelling less pleasant. In this new effort, the
                    research team sought to find out what causes the difference.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers found that most of the chemicals
                    responsible for body odor were similar between the two
                    groups of volunteers. But there were a few that made the
                    difference. Teenage sweat, for example, had high levels of
                    many kinds of carboxylic acids, which the assessors
                    described as "earthy, musty or cheesy."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They also found two steroids in the teen sweat not present
                    in the baby sweat, one of which resulted in "musk or
                    urine-like" emanations—the other, the assessors suggested,
                    smelled more like "musk and sandalwood." Without such
                    chemicals, the sweat of babies smelled much sweeter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers suggest that study of the chemical compounds
                    in teen sweat could prove fruitful for makers of
                    odor-control products. They also suggest that more work
                    could <i>[be]</i> done to better understand the impact of
                    such odors on parents.

              <p><b>Outages</b></p>
              <p>
                I would like to thank you all for your patience during the
                recent outages. Something is causing a problem with the database
                itself. It appears to be running out of room and thus having
                problems when creating backups. This is not a new phenomenon -
                NCommander observed that the database was corrupted in Nov/Dec
                2022, and he fixed the corruptions that were present at that
                time. I know that others have done similar 'repairs' over the
                years. Those of you who have been with us a while will know that
                we have had various site outages since the site's inception in
                2014. We try to get the site up as quickly as possible but we
                currently have a single active sys-admin who has to find the
                time to fix the site in between running his own business and
                having a decent work/life balance. The cause of these
                corruptions has not been identified despite speculation by some
                individuals.
              </p>
              <p><b>New Site</b></p>
              <p>
                The administration associated with creating a business continues
                and we think that we are now at the final stage. The paperwork
                has to be signed by several people and this means sending mail
                around the USA in order to get real signatures from specific
                individuals. However, we think that this should only take a week
                or two.
              </p>
              <p><b>Deleting Spam</b></p>
              <p>
                For the last month or so we have been deleting Spam from the
                Polls and journals. Deleting content is not new. Spam, doxxing,
                abusive material, CEOS, inappropriate ASCII art etc has often
                been deleted in the last 10 years. In fact, most of our
                registered community have the ability to delete some material
                (their own journals for example), and this has happened from
                time to time in the past. We also delete outdated submissions on
                a daily basis. The site software provides a means of making such
                deletions and it can cope with them. The software that is being
                used is not new - it has been in Rehash since the site became
                active. We have received some positive feedback regarding this
                measure - the Polls and journals are looking much tidier as a
                result. Unfortunately, we are going to temporarily suspend this
                measure to simplify the investigations into the database
                corruption problems. So, as unsightly as they are, we will be
                returning to the use of Spam moderations on a hopefully
                temporary basis. We have, of course, also received some negative
                feedback but it only seems to have come from a couple of
                Anonymous Cowards, one of whom is our most prolific spammer.
              </p>
              <p><b>Participation</b></p>
              <p>
                Finally, I would like to thank the staff for their continued
                efforts in keeping the site online and active. The participating
                user count continues to climb, as does the number of pages
                served each day. Many usernames that have existed for a long
                time but appear to have been inactive for a while are
                reappearing and participating in the discussions. I hope that we
                will soon be able to restructure our site in an affordable yet
                more robust structure in the very near future.

                    many music fans—and hated by so many others? Pitchfork
                    transformed indie rock, but did pop transform Pitchfork? And
                    does the Condé news really mean that Pitchfork is dead?

                  <p>
                    Over the past two months, Slate spoke to more than 30
                    Pitchfork writers, editors, and executives, past and
                    present—as well as critics, industry luminaries, and some of
                    the musicians whose careers Pitchfork made and destroyed—to
                    tell the story behind the raves, the pans, the festivals,
                    the fights, the indie spirit, the corporate takeover, and,
                    of course, the scores. This is the complete oral history of

                    [...] The gutting of Pitchfork is not just a loss for
                    writers and editors, but all music fans. Spotify's algorithm
                    can introduce you to new music but it can't contextualise it
                    or tell its stories. Replacing media "gatekeepers" with AI
                    ones has not enriched the culture. There are new formats for
                    music journalism – the YouTuber Anthony Fantano is perhaps
                    the world's most influential music critic, while Cole
                    Cuchna's podcast Dissect is a masterclass in analysis – but

                    critical culture in the written word. While some music
                    websites survive, notably the defiantly left-field digital
                    magazine, the Quietus, it is striking that the alleged
                    dinosaurs of print, led in the UK by Mojo and Uncut, have
                    outlasted most of their supposed successors.

                    While it doesn't have the same relevance to public
                    consciousness as safety problems with commercial airliners,
                    a successful test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in
                    May would be welcome news for the beleaguered aerospace
                    company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This will be the first time the Starliner capsule flies into
                    low-Earth orbit with humans aboard. NASA astronauts Butch
                    Wilmore and Suni Williams are in the final stages of
                    training for the so-called Crew Flight Test (CFT), a
                    milestone running seven years behind the schedule Boeing
                    said it could achieve when it won a $4.2 billion commercial
                    crew contract from NASA a decade ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If schedules hold, Wilmore and Williams will take off inside
                    Boeing's Starliner spacecraft aboard a United Launch
                    Alliance Atlas V rocket after midnight May 1, local time,
                    from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. They
                    will fly Starliner to the International Space Station for a
                    stay of at least eight days, then return the capsule to a
                    parachute-assisted, airbag-cushioned landing in the western
                    United States, likely at White Sands, New Mexico.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first human spaceflight with Starliner will launch under
                    a lame-duck Boeing CEO. Dave Calhoun, who took the helm at
                    Boeing in 2020, announced Monday he will step down at the
                    end of the year. Boeing's chairman, Larry Kellner, will not
                    seek reelection at the company's next shareholder meeting.
                    Effective immediately, Boeing is also replacing the head of
                    its commercial airplanes unit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The last few years have not been good for Boeing. A spate of
                    safety shortcomings in the company's commercial airline
                    business has shattered the company's reputation. Two crashes
                    of Boeing's 737 Max 8 airplanes in 2018 and 2019 killed 346
                    people, and investigators blamed Boeing's design and
                    software for the accidents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In a report released by the Federal Aviation
                    Administration last month, a panel of experts found that
                    Boeing's safety culture was "inadequate and confusing." The
                    panel also noted a "lack of pilot input in aircraft design
                    and operation."

                    American workers who have more flexibility and security in
                    their jobs also have better mental health, according to
                    <a
                      href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2816735"
                      >a study of 2021 survey data</a
                    >
                    from over 18,000 nationally representative working
                    Americans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open, may not be
                    surprising to those who have faced return-to-office mandates
                    and rounds of layoffs amid the pandemic. But, it offers
                    clear data on just how important job flexibility and
                    security are to the health and well-being of workers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Overall, the study's findings indicate "the
                    substantive impact that flexible and secure jobs can have on
                    mental health in the short-term and long-term," the
                    researchers conclude.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They do note limitations of the study, the main one being
                    that the study identifies associations and can't determine
                    that job flexibility and security directly caused mental
                    health outcomes and the work absence findings. Still, they
                    suggest that workplace policies could improve the mental
                    health of employees.
