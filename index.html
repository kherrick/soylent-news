                    Jamming wireless shifters with that toolkit would be
                    considerably easier than even replay attacks, the
                    researchers say. While a jamming attack could prevent a
                    specific rider from shifting gears if a hacker were able to
                    first pick up one of their wireless shifting signals, a
                    saboteur could also simply broadcast a jamming signal at the
                    frequency used by all Shimano shifters, potentially
                    disrupting a large group of racers. The researchers even say
                    that it would be possible to read the shifting signals from
                    an entire peloton of cyclists and then jam everyone
                    <em>except</em> a chosen rider. "You can basically jam
                    everyone except you," says Northeastern professor Aanjhan
                    Ranganathan, another author of the paper.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Exactly how the patch will be deployed to customers
                    isn't quite clear either. The company writes that "riders
                    can perform a firmware update on the rear derailleur" using
                    Shimano's E-TUBE Cyclist smartphone app. But it fails to
                    mention whether the fix will apply to the front derailleur.
                    "More information about this process and steps riders can
                    take to update their Di2 systems will be available shortly,"
                    it concludes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the ruthless world of competitive cycling, which
                    has been rocked to its foundations in recent decades by
                    doping scandals, they argue that rivals hacking each others'
                    shifters is not at all a far-fetched scenario. "This is, in
                    our opinion, a different kind of doping," says Fernandes.
                    "It leaves no trace, and it allows you to cheat in the
                    sport."

                  <p>
                    More broadly, they argue that their radio-based bike hacking
                    research is a cautionary tale about the temptation to add
                    wireless electronic features to every technology, from

                    to bicycles, and the unintended consequences of that
                    long-term trend—namely, that they've all become vulnerable
                    to forms of replay and jamming attacks of the kind that
                    Shimano is now scrambling to fix.

                  <p>
                    "This is a repeating pattern," says Northeastern's
                    Ranganathan, who has also developed solutions for replay
                    attacks on cars' keyless entry systems. "When manufacturers
                    start putting in wireless features in their products, it has
                    an impact on real-world control systems. And that can cause
                    real physical harm."

                    This effectively ends Russian content creators' ability to
                    monetize their posts, including YouTube videos. The change
                    impacts accounts monetizing content through AdSense, AdMob,
                    and Ad Manager, the support page said.

                    While Google has declined requests to provide details on
                    what prompted the change, it's the latest escalation of
                    Google's ongoing battle with Russian officials working to
                    control the narrative on Russia's war with Ukraine.

                    in Russia, then temporarily paused all ads in the country
                    the very next month. That March, Google paused the creation
                    of new Russia-based AdSense accounts and blocked ads
                    globally that originated from Russia. In March 2022, Google
                    also paused monetization of any content exploiting,
                    condoning, or dismissing Russia's war with Ukraine.
                    Seemingly as retaliation, Russia seized Google's bank
                    account, causing Google Russia to

                    Since then, Google has "blocked more than 1,000 YouTube

                    million videos," Reuters

                    For Russian creators who have still found ways to monetize

                    accounts that have been able to continue monetizing traffic

                    in February—perhaps influenced Google's update. The law also
                    prohibited foreign agents from placing ads on sites, and
                    under the law, foreign agents could include anti-Kremlin
                    politicians, activists, and media. With new authority,
                    Russia may have further retaliated against Google,
                    potentially forcing Google to give up the last bit of
                    monetization available to Russia-based creators increasingly
                    censored online.

                    State assembly member and Putin ally Vyacheslav Volodin said
                    that the law was needed to stop financing "scoundrels"
                    allegedly "killing our soldiers, officers, and civilians,"
                    Reuters reported.

                    [...] As Google has tried to resist pressure from Russian
                    lawmakers to censor content that officials deem illegal,
                    such as content supporting Ukraine or condemning Russia,
                    YouTube had become one of the last bastions of online free
                    speech, Reuters reported. It's unclear how ending
                    monetization in the region will impact access to
                    anti-Kremlin reporting on YouTube or more broadly online in
                    Russia. Last February, a popular journalist with 1.64
                    million subscribers on YouTube, Katerina Gordeeva, wrote on
                    Telegram that "she was suspending her work due to the law,"
                    Reuters reported.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We will no longer be able to work as before," Gordeeva
                    said. "Of course, we will look for a way out."

                    In 2002, after a Pentagon news briefing, the then US
                    secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld was
                    <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3254852.stm"
                      >widely ridiculed</a

                    for his thoughts about knowledge. Discussing the issue of
                    whether Iraq was supplying weapons of mass destruction to
                    terrorists, he said:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know
                    we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to
                    say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there
                    are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don't know we don't
                    know.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rumsfeld was describing a world characterised by
                    uncertainty, insecurity and ambiguity. And he actually made
                    a valid point about how leaders face situations where
                    complete knowledge is not, and cannot be, available.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This awareness of a lack of knowledge is something we call a
                    state of "unknowingness". And
                    <a
                      href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00187267231218630"
                      >our research suggests</a
                    >
                    , perhaps surprisingly, that it can be a good thing for
                    leaders and the organisations they run.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] We also found that if "unknowingness" is recognised
                    and accepted, it can lead to better decision making across
                    an organisation – and improved leadership overall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But any organisation which has to deal with "unknowns"
                    (whether they are known or unknown) would benefit from
                    recognising and accepting these particular challenges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There may be little they can do about the things they don't
                    even know they don't know about yet. But when they are aware
                    of the absence of knowledge, and accept an inability to know
                    everything or always make the "right" decision,
                    <a
                      href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00187267231218630"

                    Publishing their results in
                    <em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em>, the scientists
                    describe using a large language model—an AI tool like the
                    one that powers ChatGPT—to engineer a version of a
                    bacteria-killing drug that was previously toxic in humans,
                    so that it would be safe to use.

                    The prognosis for patients with dangerous bacterial
                    infections has worsened in recent years as
                    antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains spread and the
                    development of new treatment options has stalled. However,
                    UT researchers say AI tools are game-changing.

                    [...] Large language models, or LLMs, were originally
                    designed to generate and explore sequences of text, but
                    scientists are finding creative ways to apply these models
                    to other domains. For example, just as sentences are made up
                    of sequences of words, proteins are made up of sequences of
                    amino acids. LLMs cluster together words that share common
                    attributes (such as cat, dog, and hamster) in what’s known
                    as an “embedding space” with thousands of dimensions.
                    Similarly, proteins with similar functions, like the ability
                    to fight off dangerous bacteria without hurting the people
                    who host said bacteria, may cluster together in their own
                    version of an AI embedding space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The space containing all molecules is enormous,” said
                    Davies, co-senior author of the new paper. “Machine learning
                    allows us to find the areas of chemical space that have the
                    properties we’re interested in, and it can do it so much
                    more quickly and thoroughly than standard one-at-a-time lab
                    approaches.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For this project, the researchers employed AI to identify
                    ways to reengineer an existing antibiotic called Protegrin-1
                    that is great at killing bacteria, but toxic to people.
                    Protegrin-1, which is naturally produced by pigs to combat
                    infections, is part of a subtype of antibiotics called
                    antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). AMPs generally kill bacteria
                    directly by disrupting cell membranes, but many target both
                    bacterial and human cell membranes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, the researchers used
                    <a
                      href="https://cns.utexas.edu/news/research/promise-new-antibiotics-lies-shackling-tiny-toxic-tetherballs-bacteria"
                      >a high-throughput method they had previously developed</a
                    >
                    to create more than 7,000 variations of Protegrin-1 and
                    quickly identify areas of the AMP that could be modified
                    without losing its antibiotic activity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, they trained a protein LLM on these results so that
                    the model could evaluate millions of possible variations for
                    three features: selectively targeting bacterial membranes,
                    potently killing bacteria and not harming human red blood
                    cells to find those that fell in the sweet spot of all
                    three. The model then helped guide the team to a safer, more
                    effective version of Protegrin-1, which they dubbed
                    bacterially selective Protegrin-1.2 (bsPG-1.2).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mice infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria and treated
                    with bsPG-1.2 were much less likely to have detectable
                    bacteria in their organs six hours after infection, compared
                    to untreated mice. If further testing offers similarly
                    positive results, the researchers hope eventually to take a
                    version of the AI-informed antibiotic drug into human
                    trials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Machine learning’s impact is twofold,” Davies said. “It’s
                    going to point out new molecules that could have the
                    potential to help people, and it’s going to show us how we
                    can take those existing antibiotic molecules and make them
                    better and focus our work to more quickly get those to
                    clinical practice.”

                in nearly every city, places where people were promised food and
                shelter while employment was scarce, but quickly became
                overcrowded and with poor living conditions. The general public
                is mostly unaware of the conditions within the sanctuary
                districts, whose residents are prevented from leaving and have
                largely been forgotten. The residents are referred to by slang
                terms of
                <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Gimmie"
                  >gimmies</a

                (people who struggled to integrate and joined gangs). During the
                Bell Riots, some ghosts and other residents overpowered the
                guards, took hostages, and seized control of the sanctuary's
                processing center for incoming residents. Despite rumors that
                the hostages had been killed,
                <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Gabriel_Bell"
                  >Gabriel Bell</a
                >
                prevented this from happening. Bell was able to broadcast from
                the district and inform the public of the living conditions
                within the district, which brought the living conditions to the
                general public's attention and spurred on reforms.

                However, when Sisko is attacked on August 31 by a gang of
                ghosts, Gabriel Bell is killed by a ghost named B.C. while
                trying to help Sisko fend off off the attackers. This alters the
                timeline, and Sisko assumes the role of Bell to try to restore
                the proper course of history. There is no longer a Federation in
                the 24th century, no evidence of advanced technology on Earth,
                and there is a Romulan outpost at Alpha Centuary. Chief O'Brien
                and Major Kira use the transporters to travel back in time to a
                few points in history to try to find the missing crew members
                and restore the timeline. The episode's script includes this
                dialogue:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    <b>O'BRIEN:</b> Well, we know one thing. They arrived before
                    the year twenty forty eight.<br /><b>ODO:</b> How can you be
                    sure?<br /><b>O'BRIEN:</b> Because we were just there. And
                    that wasn't the mid-twenty first century I read about in
                    school. It's been changed. I mean, Earth history has been
                    through its rough patches, but never that rough.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                In the Star Trek universe, 2048 occurs within
                <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/World_War_III"
                  >World War III</a
                >, which includes the use of strategic nuclear weapons by the
                United States, China, and Russia. This leads to a nuclear winter
                and the collapse of society. Past Tense was written to examine
                the issue of homelessness, specifically that homeless people are
                moved out of view of the general public and are forgotten about.
                There is a contrast of the extreme wealth of people like Chris
                Brynner and the destitution in the sanctuary districts. The
                story also serves as a warning that failing to address societal
                inequality may lead to more severe problems in the future, in
                this case making WWIII and the societal collapse far worse. One
                of the writers, Ira Steven Behr, commented that B.C. is not
                viewed as a murderer despite killing the real Gabriel Bell
                because society forced him into the situation, and he was just
                trying to survive the conditions in the sanctuary district. In
                2021, writer Robert Hewitt Wolfe said about the episode:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    "As a writer, all you can do is be a voice in the
                    wilderness, sometimes. You can yell, 'Fire!' but you can't
                    put it out. It's disappointing that we're still grappling
                    with this problem. I certainly would have hoped it would be
                    better by now, and people would be like, 'Ha! Remember that
                    Deep Space Nine episode that said homelessness would still
                    be a problem in the 2020s? They were so gloomy!' But one of
                    the themes of the show is that paradise doesn't come for
                    free. Even if it does get handed to you, you have to
                    continually work to protect it and renew it and advance it."
                  </p>
                </div>
              </blockquote>

                Deep Space Nine is my favorite of all of the Star Trek series,
                and these are two of my favorite episodes. Although some people
                criticized the story for being too preachy and politicized, when
                it was wrapped up by Sisko, Bashir, and Dax restoring the
                timeline, I considered it a very memorable and compelling story.
                World War III, which begins in 2026, is mentioned in multiple
                series as a disastrous event for humanity, and although I'm not
                aware of this being shown on screen, this story does fill in
                some of the prelude up to the war. Have any readers seen this
                two-part episode? If so, what are your thoughts on this story
                and the themes it examines?

                    Tangsuan had a severe dairy and nut allergy and informed the
                    waitstaff at the restaurant of her dietary needs, and was
                    "unequivocally assured" they could be accommodated. She
                    ordered and ate the "Sure I'm Frittered" vegetarian broccoli
                    and corn fritters, the "Scallop Forest" sea scallops
                    appetizer, the "This Shepherd Went Vegan" entree, and a side
                    of onion rings.

                    [...] In the latest update for the Disney Springs wrongful
                    death lawsuit, Disney cited legal language within the terms
                    and conditions for Disney+, which "requires users to
                    arbitrate all disputes with the company." Disney claims
                    Piccolo reportedly agreed to this in 2019 when signing up
                    for a one-month free trial of the streaming service on his
                    PlayStation console.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the May 31 motion filed to move the wrongful death
                    lawsuit to arbitration, Disney attorneys said that the
                    Disney+ subscriber agreement states that any dispute, except
                    for small claims, "must be resolved by individual binding
                    arbitration." Disney says that similar language was agreed
                    to by Piccolo when he used the My Disney Experience app to
                    purchase tickets to visit EPCOT at Walt Disney World in
                    September 2023. Tangsuan died before she and Piccolo could
                    use the tickets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Attorneys for Piccolo called Disney's latest motion
                    "preposterous," and that it's "'absurd' to believe that the
                    153 million subscribers to the popular streaming service
                    have waived all claims against the company and its
                    affiliates because of language 'buried' within the terms and
                    conditions," according to Newsday.

                    It was only in February when Cisco laid off 4,000 people, or
                    5% of its workforce, as it struggled with a challenging
                    economy and weak demand.

                    possibly alongside its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.
                    The publication writes that the number of people being let
                    go is likely to match or be higher than the 4,000 employees
                    laid off in February. The company had nearly 85,000 workers
                    at the end of fiscal 2023; this count does not include the
                    effects of the previous round of layoffs.

                    of cybersecurity specialist Splunk in March, a purchase that
                    Cisco hopes will reduce its reliance on one-time equipment
                    sales by boosting its subscription offerings.

                    As with so many recent layoffs in the tech world, AI has
                    once again played a part in people losing their jobs. Cisco
                    launched a $1 billion fund to make investments in AI
                    startups in June, and it has made 20 AI-focused acquisitions
                    and investments in the last several years. Cost cutting
                    helps offset these big investments, and fears that returns
                    on AI spending won't match the money being poured into the
                    industry isn't helping matters.

                    A recent study has found that 94% of spreadsheets used in
                    business decision-making contain errors, posing serious
                    risks for financial losses and operational mistakes. This
                    finding highlights the need for better quality assurance
                    practices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study, led by Prof. Pak-Lok Poon in collaboration with
                    Central Queensland University, Swinburne University of
                    Technology, City University of Hong Kong, and The Royal
                    Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, shows that most spreadsheets
                    used in important business applications have errors that can
                    affect decision-making processes. "The high rate of errors
                    in these spreadsheets is concerning," says Prof. Poon.

                  <p>
                    Errors in spreadsheets can lead to poor decisions, resulting
                    in financial losses, pricing mistakes, and operational
                    problems in fields like health care and nuclear operations.
                    "These mistakes can cause major issues in various sectors,"
                    adds Prof. Poon.

                    The Sun is going through an intense time right now. Our host

                    solar eruptions aimed towards Earth that resulted in a rare

                    geomagnetic storm triggered bright, colorful auroras last
                    night in different parts of the world, with a chance for

                    least five CMEs that erupted from the Sun since last week in
                    anticipation that some may be headed towards Earth. “Some
                    seem to have missed Earth, some clipped Earth, and then
                    eventually one of those we were anticipating was much more
                    of a good punch,” Shawn Dahl, service coordinator for the

                    of sunspots since 2002. CMEs typically erupt from regions on
                    the Sun with increased amounts of magnetic flux associated
                    with sunspots, and so far the Sun has sprouted 299 sunspots

                    increased activity all of this year, all of next year, and
                    even in 2026 where we’ll continue to have higher chances
                    this type of activity to continue to happen from time to

                    In San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood, neighbors
                    say repeated honking from Waymo driverless cars is
                    disturbing their sleep.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Multiple residents in high-rise buildings off of 2nd Street
                    near Harrison Street told NBC Bay Area News they have been
                    hearing Waymo vehicles honking in a nearby parking lot for
                    the past several weeks. They said that the lot began to be
                    occupied by Waymo vehicles just a few weeks ago. The Waymos
                    appear to go to the lot to rest in between rides.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Christopher Cherry who lives in the building next door said
                    he was "really excited" to have Waymo in the neighborhood,
                    thinking it would bring more security and quiet to the area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We started out with a couple of honks here and there, and
                    then as more and more cars started to arrive, the situation
                    got worse, " Cherry said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cherry said the honking happens daily at different levels,
                    with the most intense honking occurring at around 4:00 a.m.
                    and at evening rush hour times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Videos from residents of these incidents show Waymo
                    cars filing into the parking lot, and then attempting to
                    back into spots, which appears to trigger honking from the
                    other Waymo cars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Neighbors note, there is no one in the cars that they
                    can flag down and ask to stop the honking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I think the most frustrating thing about this is that there
                    is just nobody to talk to, and even at the corporate level,
                    I am finding it difficult, not impossible," White said.

                    The CrowdStrike outage was a massive global event, which has
                    now been recognised with a massive Pwnie Award trophy. The
                    two-tiered trophy awarded to CrowdStrike dwarfed the smaller
                    pony-shaped ones for other categories, as befitting the
                    eclipsing size of its blunder.

                  <p>
                    "Definitely not the award to be proud of receiving,"
                    <a href="https://x.com/singe/status/1822324795645575263"
                      >Sentonas said in his acceptance speech</a
                    >, taking the stage to laughter and applause. "I think the
                    team was surprised when I said straight away that I'd be
                    coming to get it. We got this horribly wrong, we've said
                    that a number of different times. It's super important to
                    own it when you do things well, it's super important to own
                    it when you do things horribly wrong, which we did in this
                    case."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Accepting the large golden trophy, Sentonas stated that he
                    intended to display it at CrowdStrike's headquarters in
                    Austin, Texas. His hope is that it will serve as a reminder
                    to CrowdStrike's staff to prevent such mistakes from
                    happening in the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The reason why I wanted the trophy is I'm heading back to
                    headquarters," Sentosas continued. "I'm gonna take the
                    trophy with me, it's gonna sit pride of place, because I
                    want every CrowdStriker who comes to work to see it. Because
                    our goal is to protect people, and we got this wrong, and I
                    want to make sure that everybody understands these things
                    can't happen, and that's what this community's about. So
                    from that perspective I will say thank you."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sentonas' in-person acceptance of CrowdStrike's Pwnie Award
                    was widely well-received, with social media users praising
                    him for accepting accountability with humility, class, and
                    good humour.

                    Though CrowdStrike's Most Epic Fail trophy was only awarded
                    this weekend, its win had already been announced alongside

                    in late July. This was within mere days of the

                    that took down numerous companies and services worldwide. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a post to X at the time, the Pwnie Awards stated that it
                    was granting the early award due to
                    <a
                      href="https://x.com/PwnieAwards/status/1816163091316629819"
                      >"extenuating circumstances."</a
                    >
                    Said circumstance was likely the fact that CrowdStrike's
                    fail was so epic that no one was likely to match it unless
                    they deliberately tried. Even then, it would still be a
                    difficult task.

                  <p>
                    While all other categories at the 2024 Pwnie Awards had
                    three finalists, CrowdStrike had no competition for the Epic
                    Fail Award. Instead,

                    submitted to the US District Court for the Southern District

                    tried to sell this huge collection of personal data on the
                    dark web to the tune of $3.5 million. It's worth noting that
                    due to the sheer number of people affected, this data likely
                    comes from both the U.S. and other countries around the
                    world.

                    Here's everything we know so far about this massive data

                    your personal information was exposed online.

                  <p>
                    So how does a firm like National Public Data obtain the
                    personal data of almost 3 billion people? The answer is
                    through scraping which is a technique used by companies to
                    collect data from web sites and other sources online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What makes the way National Public Data did this more
                    concerning is that the firm scraped personally identifiable
                    information (<a
                      href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/your-browsers-spell-check-feature-could-be-giving-away-your-passwords"
                      >PII</a
                    >) of billions of people from non-public sources. As a
                    result, many of the people who are now involved in the class
                    action lawsuit did not provide their data to the company
                    willingly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the complaint, one of the plaintiffs who
                    resides in California first found out about the breach
                    because he was using one of the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-identity-theft-protection,review-2083.html"

                    >
                    which notified him that his data was exposed and leaked on
                    the dark web.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As part of the class action lawsuit, this plaintiff is
                    asking the court to have National Public Data securely
                    dispose of all the personal information it acquired through
                    scraping. However, he also wants the firm to compensate him
                    and the other victims financially while implementing
                    stricter security measures going forward.
                  </p>

                    With full names, addresses and Social Security Numbers in
                    hand, there's a lot that hackers can do with this
                    information, especially when it was made available for sale
                    on the dark web.

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    [...]     Mr. Oliva tells us that, between enshittified
                    software and free software, the choice is not hard. It’s the
                    very article’s title, and it alone should scandalize anyone
                    with minimal knowledge in the matter between its implicit
                    lack of touch with objective reality and its close distance
                    with hypocrisy, all that in a very light tone that even had
                    the intention of being somehow funny. And this discourse
                    wasn’t even in a divulgation context, with an auditorium
                    strange to free software: it was for LibrePlanet, where most
                    people use free software and knows its history and details.
                    Considering that Mr. Oliva is a public and important figure
                    inside the community, a referent, and also considering that
                    I can very rarely participate in this kind of community
                    events -because I have very little free time-, I immediately
                    asked myself: is this the kind of stuff the community is
                    talking about? Are this the discursive lines our references
                    tell us to follow?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        No, Mr. Oliva, I’m afraid you’re deeply mistaken:
                    <em>choosing free software is hard</em>. VERY hard.
                    <i>TOO</i> hard, I dare say. And I have my serious
                    suspicions that our leaders/references and the course of our
                    communities has a lot to do with that. But let’s take a look
                    at this argument by contrasting my context with your
                    article.
                  </p>
                  <p>The tip of the iceberg</p>
                  <p>
                        Mr. Oliva tells us about different types of software
                    enshittification in different contexts, both historical and
                    operational. Stuff we all know and hate like forced updates,
                    software stores, remote policying, inability to go back to
                    previous versions, and so on and so on. Please go read the
                    full article, as in this regards is actually fruitful if you
                    don’t know what we’re talking about here. I believe all of
                    Mr. Oliva’s remarks are true: enshittification is a real
                    phenomenon, he’s not the first one to mention it (as he
                    adequately clarifies), and it’s an actual and important
                    issue that we all need to pay attention to. That’s all fine,
                    and the problem with his article of course is not there. The
                    problem is how he talks about it, specially to force his
                    interpretations as if it where some kind of “common sense”.
                    So it’s important to take a look at his arguments.

                Rights which we had in the analog world are getting increasingly
                difficult to carry over into the digital realm. Whether we can
                or not will depend on software and the protocols and file
                formats the software rely upon.

                    As soon as this week, NASA officials will make perhaps the
                    agency's most consequential safety decision in human
                    spaceflight in 21 years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are nearly
                    10 weeks into a test flight that was originally set to last
                    a little more than one week. The two retired US Navy test
                    pilots were the first people to fly into orbit on Boeing's
                    Starliner spacecraft when it launched on June 5. Now, NASA
                    officials aren't sure Starliner is safe enough to bring the
                    astronauts home.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Three of the managers at the center of the pending decision,
                    Ken Bowersox and Steve Stich from NASA and Boeing's LeRoy
                    Cain, either had key roles in the ill-fated final flight of
                    Space Shuttle <em>Columbia </em>in 2003 or felt the
                    consequences of the accident.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At that time, officials misjudged the risk. Seven astronauts
                    died, and the Space Shuttle <em>Columbia</em> was destroyed
                    as it reentered the atmosphere over Texas. Bowersox, Stich,
                    and Cain weren't the people making the call on the health of
                    <em>Columbia</em>'s heat shield in 2003, but they had
                    front-row seats to the consequences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bowersox was an astronaut on the International Space Station
                    when NASA lost <em>Columbia</em>. He and his crewmates were
                    waiting to hitch a ride home on the next Space Shuttle
                    mission, which was delayed two-and-a-half years in the wake
                    of the <em>Columbia </em>accident. Instead, Bowersox's crew
                    came back to Earth later that year on a Russian Soyuz
                    capsule. After retiring from the astronaut corps, Bowersox
                    worked at SpaceX and is now the head of NASA's spaceflight
                    operations directorate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Stich and Cain were NASA flight directors in 2003, and they
                    remain well-respected in human spaceflight circles. Stich is
                    now the manager of NASA's commercial crew program, and Cain
                    is now a Boeing employee and chair of the company's
                    Starliner mission director. For the ongoing Starliner
                    mission, Bowersox, Stich, and Cain are in the
                    decision-making chain.

                    All three joined NASA in the late 1980s, soon after the
                    <em>Challenger </em>accident. They have seen NASA attempt to
                    reshape its safety culture after both of NASA's fatal Space
                    Shuttle tragedies. After <em>Challenger, </em>NASA's
                    astronaut office had a more central role in safety
                    decisions, and the agency made efforts to listen to dissent
                    from engineers. Still, human flaws are inescapable, and
                    NASA's culture was unable to alleviate them during
                    <em>Columbia</em>'s last flight in 2003.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "I have wondered if some in management roles today
                    that were here when we lost <em>Challenger</em> and
                    <em>Columbia </em>remember that in both of those tragedies,
                    there were those that were not comfortable proceeding," Milt
                    Heflin, a retired NASA flight director who spent 47 years at
                    the agency, wrote in an email to Ars. "Today, those memories
                    are still around."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I suspect Stich and Cain are paying attention to the right
                    stuff," Heflin wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The question facing NASA's leadership today? Should the two
                    astronauts return to Earth from the International Space
                    Station in Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, with its history
                    of thruster failures and helium leaks, or should they come
                    home on a SpaceX Dragon capsule?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under normal conditions, the first option is the choice
                    everyone at NASA would like to make. It would be least
                    disruptive to operations at the space station and would
                    potentially maintain a clearer future for Boeing's Starliner
                    program, which NASA would like to become operational for
                    regular crew rotation flights to the station.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But some people at NASA
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/nasa-official-acknowledges-internal-disagreement-on-safety-of-starliner-return/"
                      >aren't convinced this is the right call</a
                    >. Engineers still don't fully understand why five of the
                    Starliner spacecraft's thrusters overheated and lost power
                    as the capsule approached the space station for docking in
                    June. Four of these five control jets are now back in action
                    with near-normal performance, but managers would like to be
                    sure the same thrusters—and maybe more—won't fail again as
                    Starliner departs the station and heads for reentry.

                    underpinning the clinical development of MDMA—aka ecstasy—as
                    a psychedelic treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.
                    The move came just a day after news broke that the Food and

                    The lawsuits also argue that RealPage pressures landlords to
                    comply with its pricing suggestions—something that would
                    make no sense if the company were merely being paid to offer
                    individualized advice. In

                    >
                    with ProPublica, Jeffrey Roper, who helped develop one of
                    RealPage's main software tools, acknowledged that one of the
                    greatest threats to a landlord's profits is when nearby
                    properties set prices too low. "If you have idiots
                    undervaluing, it costs the whole system," he said. RealPage
                    thus makes it hard for customers to override its
                    recommendations, according to the lawsuits, allegedly even
                    requiring a written justification and explicit approval from
                    RealPage staff. Former employees have said that failure to
                    comply with the company's recommendations could result in
                    clients being kicked off the service. "This, to me, is the
                    biggest giveaway," Lee Hepner, an antitrust lawyer at the
                    American Economic Liberties Project, an anti-monopoly
                    organization, told me. "Enforced compliance is the hallmark
                    feature of any cartel."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The challenge is this: Under existing antitrust law,
                    showing that companies A and B used algorithm C to raise
                    prices isn't enough; you need to show that there was some
                    kind of agreement between companies A and B, and you need to
                    allege some specific factual basis that the agreement
                    existed <i>before</i> you can formally request evidence of
                    it. This dynamic can place plaintiffs in a catch-22:
                    Plausibly alleging the existence of a price-fixing agreement
                    is hard to do without access to evidence like private
                    emails, internal documents, or the algorithm itself. But
                    they typically can't uncover those kinds of materials until
                    they are given the legal power to request evidence in
                    discovery. "It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round
                    hole," Richard Powers, a former deputy assistant attorney
                    general in the DOJ antitrust division, told me. "It makes
                    the job really hard."

                    have outlined ways in which algorithms could fix prices that
                    would be even more difficult to prevent or
                    prosecute—including situations in which an algorithm learns
                    to fix prices withouts its creators or users intending it
                    to. Something similar could occur even if companies used
                    <i>different</i> third-party algorithms to set prices. They
                    point to
                    <a
                      href="https://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/clark_acex_jan_2021.pdf"
                      >a recent study</a
                    >
                    of German gas stations, which found that when one major
                    player adopted a pricing algorithm, its margins didn't
                    budge, but when two major players adopted different pricing
                    algorithms, the margins for both increased by 38 percent.
                    "In situations like these, the algorithms themselves
                    actually learn to collude with each other," Stucke told me.
                    "That could make it possible to fix prices at a scale that
                    we've never seen."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    None of the situations Stucke and Ezrachi describe involve
                    an explicit agreement, making them almost impossible to
                    prosecute under existing antitrust laws. Price-fixing, in
                    other words, has entered the algorithmic age, but the laws
                    designed to prevent it have not kept up. Powers said he
                    believes existing antitrust laws cover algorithmic
                    collusion—but he worried that he might be wrong. "That's the
                    thing that kept me up at night," he said about his tenure at
                    the Department of Justice. "The worry that all 100-plus
                    years of case law on price-fixing could be circumvented by
                    technology."

                  <p>
                    [...] Whether other jurisdictions follow suit remains to be
                    seen. In the meantime, more and more companies are figuring
                    out ways to use algorithms to set prices. If these really do
                    enable de facto price-fixing, and manage to escape legal
                    scrutiny, the result could be a kind of pricing dystopia in
                    which competition to create better products and lower prices
                    would be replaced by coordination to keep prices high and
                    profits flowing. That would mean permanently higher costs
                    for consumers—like an inflation nightmare that never ends.
                    More profound, it would undermine the incentives that keep
                    economies growing and living standards rising. The basic
                    premise of free-market capitalism is that prices are set
                    through open competition, not by a central planner. That
                    goes for algorithmic central planners too.

                    The main challenge was that according to conventional
                    understanding, when two white dwarfs collide like this, they
                    should explode and disappear. However, this merger left
                    behind a white dwarf. The spinning white dwarf was expected
                    to create a stellar wind (a fast-flowing stream of
                    particles) immediately after its formation. However, what
                    the researchers found was something else.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If the wind had started blowing immediately after SNR
                    1181's formation, we couldn't reproduce the observed size of
                    the inner shock region," said Ko. "However, by treating the
                    wind's onset time as variable, we succeeded in explaining
                    all of the observed features of SNR 1181 accurately and
                    unraveling the mysterious properties of this high-speed
                    wind. We were also able to simultaneously track the time
                    evolution of each shock region, using numerical
                    calculations."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team was very surprised to find that according to their
                    calculations, the wind may have started blowing only very
                    recently, within the past 20-30 years. They suggest this may
                    indicate that the white dwarf has started to burn again,
                    possibly due to some of the matter thrown out by the
                    explosion witnessed in 1181 falling back to its surface,
                    increasing its density and temperature over a threshold to
                    restart burning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To validate their computer model, the team is now preparing
                    to further observe SNR 1181 using the Very Large Array (VLA)
                    radio telescope based in central New Mexico and the
                    8.2-meter-class Subaru Telescope in Hawaii.

                    "The ability to determine the age of supernova remnants or
                    the brightness at the time of their explosion through
                    archaeological perspectives is a rare and invaluable asset
                    to modern astronomy," said Ko. "Such interdisciplinary
                    research is both exciting and highlights the immense
                    potential for combining diverse fields to uncover new
                    dimensions of astronomical phenomena."

                    "It isn't all negative. International trade can also have
                    positive impacts," said co-author, Dr. Mengyu Li, a Horizon
                    Fellow also at the Center for Integrated Analysis in the
                    Faculty of Science. "While trade can promote economic growth
                    and reduce poverty, it can also lead to increasing

                    The research, which spans three decades from 1990 to 2018,
                    employs a systematic quantitative assessment of 12 selected
                    Sustainable Development Goals. The authors say that the lack
                    of defined consumption-based indicators aligned with the SDG
                    framework has hindered a comprehensive understanding of
                    these trends.

                  <p>
                    As an alternative, the authors propose the use of
                    consumption-based proxies to analyze global supply chain
                    dynamics, trends and their implications for progress towards
                    the UN SDGs.

                    The study identified the biggest polarizing effects in SDG13
                    (Climate Action), SDG11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)
                    and SDG2 (Zero Hunger). The biggest equalizing effects were
                    identified for SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and

                    In the name of consumer protection, a slew of U.S. federal
                    agencies are working to make it easier for Americans to

                    A broad new government initiative, dubbed "Time Is Money,"
                    includes a rollout of new regulations and the promise of
                    more for industries spanning from healthcare and fitness
                    memberships to media subscriptions.

                    "The administration is cracking down on all the ways that
                    companies, through paperwork, hold times and general
                    aggravation waste people's money and waste people's time and
                    really hold onto their money," Neera Tanden, White House
                    domestic policy adviser, told reporters Friday in advance of
                    the announcement.

                    delaying services to you or really trying to make it so
                    difficult for you to cancel the service that they get to
                    hold onto your money for longer and longer," Tanden said.

                    for 13th and 14th Gen Raptor Lake Core family of CPUs over
                    the course of August.

                    The updated CPU microcode, which should be finalized in the
                    coming days, is supposed to stop Intel's wobbly desktop
                    microprocessors from crashing at normal clock speeds (an
                    "instability" as the x86 giant puts it) to frying themselves
                    and causing permanent damage if not complete failure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Apparently, the original microcode for Raptor Lake
                    processors applied too much voltage to chips. While
                    increasing voltage can make it possible to hit higher clock
                    speeds with ironclad stability, too much voltage can be
                    dangerous and degrade the silicon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although microcode updates are developed by Intel, they have
                    to be distributed via motherboard BIOSes developed by
                    individual motherboard vendors, including DIY brands like
                    ASUS and MSI, and also OEMs. When it comes to microcode
                    patches, Intel (and its rival AMD) can't guarantee when
                    users will receive it or if all users will even get it at
                    all, since it is up to individual motherboard makers to
                    issue new BIOS versions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's not ideal for both Chipzilla and owners of Raptor
                    Lake CPUs, as the longer it takes for the microcode to
                    disseminate, the more opportunities there are for more chips
                    to fail, providing more fuel for

                    However, at least ASUS and MSI seem to be working fast on
                    updating their motherboards, with both saying that they'll
                    start distributing BIOSes with the new microcode next week.
                    Intel said the microcode itself wouldn't be done until the
                    middle of the month.

                    Engineers on NASA's NEOWISE (Near-Earth Object Wide-field
                    Infrared Survey Explorer) mission commanded the spacecraft
                    to turn its transmitter off for the last time Thursday. This
                    concludes more than 10 years of its planetary defense
                    mission to search for asteroids and comets, including those
                    that could pose a threat to Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] NASA ended the mission because NEOWISE will soon drop
                    too low in its orbit around Earth to provide usable science
                    data. An uptick in solar activity is heating the upper
                    atmosphere, causing it to expand and create drag on the
                    spacecraft, which does not have a propulsion system to keep
                    it in orbit. Now decommissioned, NEOWISE is expected to
                    safely burn up in our planet's atmosphere in late 2024.

                    During its operational lifetime, the infrared survey
                    telescope exceeded scientific objectives for not one but two
                    missions, starting with the WISE (Wide-field Infrared Survey
                    Explorer) mission. Managed by JPL, WISE launched in December
                    2009 with a seven-month mission to scan the entire infrared
                    sky.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By July 2010, WISE had accomplished this with far greater
                    sensitivity than previous surveys. A few months later, the
                    telescope ran out of the coolant that kept heat produced by
                    the spacecraft from interfering with its infrared
                    observations. (Invisible to the human eye, infrared
                    wavelengths are associated with heat.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA extended the mission under the name NEOWISE until
                    February 2011 to complete a survey of the main belt
                    asteroids, at which point the spacecraft was put into
                    hibernation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Analysis of this data showed that although the lack of
                    coolant meant the space telescope could no longer observe
                    the faintest infrared objects in the universe, it could
                    still make precise observations of asteroids and comets that
                    generate a strong infrared signal from being heated by the
                    sun as they travel past our planet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA brought the telescope out of hibernation in 2013 under
                    the Near-Earth Object Observations Program, a precursor for
                    the agency's Planetary Defense Coordination Office, to
                    continue the NEOWISE survey of asteroids and comets in the
                    pursuit of planetary defense.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The NEOWISE mission has provided a unique,
                    long-duration data set of the infrared sky that will be used
                    by scientists for decades to come," said Amy Mainzer,
                    principal investigator for both NEOWISE and NEO Surveyor at
                    the University of California, Los Angeles. "But its
                    additional legacy is that it has helped lay the groundwork
                    for NASA's next planetary defense infrared space telescope."

                    [...] Anthropomorphism might cause users to place more trust
                    in the output of a model when it "hallucinates" incorrect
                    information, OpenAI says. Over time, it might even affect
                    users' relationships with other people. "Users might form
                    social relationships with the AI, reducing their need for
                    human interaction—potentially benefiting lonely individuals
                    but possibly affecting healthy relationships," the document
                    says.

                    Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, head of preparedness at OpenAI,
                    says that voice mode could evolve into a uniquely powerful
                    interface. He also notes that the kind of emotional effects
                    seen with GPT-4o can be positive—say, by helping those who
                    are lonely or who need to practice social interactions. He
                    adds that the company will study anthropomorphism and the
                    emotional connections closely, including by monitoring how
                    beta testers interact with ChatGPT. "We don't have results
                    to share at the moment, but it's on our list of concerns,"
                    he says.

                    Office acknowledged to ProPublica that it had identified
                    multiple such attempts — including unsuccessful efforts to

                    that the portal suffered at least two security glitches that
                    briefly exposed voters' dates of birth, the last four digits
                    of their Social Security numbers and their full driver's
                    license numbers — the exact information needed to cancel

                    [...] The official X account for Georgia Senate Democrats
                    posted that the voter registration cancellation portal
                    "empowers conspiracy theorists and other bad actors to deny
                    Georgians the right to vote." In response,

                    Raffensperger, noting: "​​Lots of people have their birthday
                    in the public domain." One user posted, "Overwhelm them with
                    cancelled well-known Republican's registrations!"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To start the cancellation process on the portal, all users
                    need is a voter's name, date of birth and county of
                    residence. To finalize the cancellation request, they also
                    must provide the last four digits of the voter's Social
                    Security number or their full driver's license number.
                    There's also an option to fill out a form with that
                    information and print and send it to the voter's county
                    election office or the Georgia Secretary of State's Office.
                    Hassinger said that election workers would not approve any
                    paper request that lacked a Social Security number or
                    driver's license number.

                    Intel also made several strategic blunders. Chipzilla's

                    considering the mobile market unprofitable, was a critical

                    I also noticed, though, that Intel doesn't actually make
                    this chip. It relies instead on TSMC, at least until Intel
                    gets its AI foundry business up and running.

                    I'm not counting Intel out — not yet, anyway. But a few
                    years ago, I wouldn't have written Boeing off either, and
                    that was a bad bet. It wouldn't surprise me if my hope for
                    Intel to get its act together also turns out to be forlorn.

                    A groundbreaking study has revealed new insights into the
                    Earth’s crust’s immediate behavior following earthquakes.
                    Researchers have utilized sub-daily Global Positioning
                    System (GPS) solutions to accurately measure the spatial and
                    temporal evolution of early afterslip following the 2010 Mw
                    8.8 Maule earthquake. This innovative approach marks a
                    significant advancement in seismic analysis, offering a more
                    precise and rapid depiction of ground deformations, which is
                    essential for assessing seismic hazards and understanding
                    fault line activities.

                    The aftermath of an earthquake is marked by intricate
                    postseismic adjustments, particularly the elusive early
                    afterslip. Daily seismic monitoring has struggled to capture
                    the rapid and complex ground movements occurring in the
                    critical hours post-quake. The intricacies of these initial
                    activities and their profound implications for seismic
                    hazard assessment highlight an urgent need for more refined
                    and immediate monitoring techniques.

                    not in the firmware of any particular computer maker, but in
                    the chips found across hundreds of millions of PCs and
                    servers. Now security researchers have found one such flaw
                    that has persisted in AMD processors for decades, and that
                    would allow malware to burrow deep enough into a computer's
                    memory that, in many cases, it may be easier to discard a
                    machine than to disinfect it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the Defcon hacker conference tomorrow, Enrique Nissim and
                    Krzysztof Okupski, researchers from the security firm
                    IOActive, plan to present a vulnerability in AMD chips
                    they're calling Sinkclose. The flaw would allow hackers to
                    run their own code in one of the most privileged modes of an
                    AMD processor, known as System Management Mode, designed to
                    be reserved only for a specific, protected portion of its
                    firmware. IOActive's researchers warn that it affects
                    virtually all AMD chips dating back to 2006, or possibly
                    even earlier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nissim and Okupski note that exploiting the bug would
                    require hackers to already have obtained relatively deep
                    access to an AMD-based PC or server, but that the Sinkclose
                    flaw would then allow them to plant their malicious code far
                    deeper still. In fact, for any machine with one of the
                    vulnerable AMD chips, the IOActive researchers warn that an
                    attacker could infect the computer with malware known as a
                    "bootkit" that evades antivirus tools and is potentially
                    invisible to the operating system, while offering a hacker
                    full access to tamper with the machine and surveil its
                    activity. For systems with certain faulty configurations in
                    how a computer maker implemented AMD's security feature
                    known as Platform Secure Boot—which the researchers warn
                    encompasses the large majority of the systems they tested—a
                    malware infection installed via Sinkclose could be harder
                    yet to detect or remediate, they say, surviving even a
                    reinstallation of the operating system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Imagine nation-state hackers or whoever wants to persist on
                    your system. Even if you wipe your drive clean, it's still
                    going to be there," says Okupski. "It's going to be nearly
                    undetectable and nearly unpatchable." Only opening a
                    computer's case, physically connecting directly to a certain
                    portion of its memory chips with a hardware-based
                    programming tool known as SPI Flash programmer and
                    meticulously scouring the memory would allow the malware to
                    be removed, Okupski says.

                    Texas pretends there’s no difference between the bored
                    bouncer and biometric scans, but if you knew the bouncer had
                    an encyclopedic, inhuman ability to remember every name and
                    face that came through the door <em>and</em> loose lips,
                    well, you wouldn’t go <em>there</em> either.

                  <p>
                    Hand-waving away these differences is the kind of thing you
                    only do if you’re highly ideologically motivated. But normal
                    people are very reasonably concerned about whether their
                    personal sexual preferences will be leaked to their boss,
                    mother-in-law, or fellow citizens. Mandatory age
                    verification turns people off of viewing porn entirely, and
                    it chills their free expression.

                  <p>
                    Sexual preferences are private and sensitive; they’re
                    exactly the type of thing you <em>don’t </em>want leaking.
                    So, of course, sexual content is a particularly juicy target
                    for would-be hackers and extortionists. People pay

                    trust the age verification software (you shouldn’t), you’re
                    likely to avoid the risk up front. <a

                    >: even though adult access to porn is technically legal,
                    people are so afraid of having their ID and last watched

                    in the first place.

                    is <em>far </em>more effective than what was available
                    twenty years ago — as the district court found — and,
                    notably, filtering software doesn’t scan adults’ faces.

                  <p>
                    [...] This is a high-stakes program. The first three Block 1
                    SLS systems will put US crews on the Moon for the first time
                    in half a century and, if all goes well, enable creation of
                    a base on our sole natural satellite.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the program misses its schedule, Boeing won't be the only
                    one wearing blame.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The report notes that NASA has changed made decisions that
                    delayed the program and helped it to sail beyond initial
                    budgets.
                  </p>
                  <p>The OIG suggests four ways to improve matters:</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Establish a training program for Boeing contractors to
                      ensure quality control is up to standard;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Implement financial penalties for Boeing if it fails to
                      meet quality standards;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Draw up a detailed timeline for the development of EUS and
                      ensure it is followed;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Work with the Defense Contract Management Agency to ensure
                      compliance.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    NASA agreed with three of those points, but is unwilling to
                    charge Boeing if the contractor fails to meet quality
                    standards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "NASA non-concurs. NASA interprets this recommendation to be
                    directing NASA to institute penalties outside the bounds of
                    the contract," the agency argued. "Instituting financial
                    penalties outside the bounds of the contract subverts the
                    control process of the contract."

                  <p>
                    The report comes at an unfortunate time for Boeing's new CEO
                    Kelly Ortberg, who started work on Thursday. Ortberg, a
                    qualified mechanical engineer who has spent most of his life
                    in aerospace, was lured out of retirement at 64 to fix
                    Boeing's corporate problems. His first move was to return
                    Boeing's corporate headquarters to Seattle and spend his
                    first day on the production floor speaking with staff.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "It also means meeting our commitments to each other
                    and working collaboratively across Boeing to meet our goals.
                    People's lives depend on what we do every day, and we must
                    keep that top of mind with every decision we make."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The CEO is apparently quite popular at Boeing, as his
                    management style elevates engineering.

                    many open-source projects used by organizations to deploy
                    resources in their AWS environments," Aqua said. "Many

                    of their functionality or instruct their users to deploy S3

                <div>
                  <p>
                    In 1886, a pharmacist named Dr. John Pemberton mixed extract
                    of the green coca leaf — containing the recently discovered
                    marvel of cocaine — with the caffeine kick of West African
                    kola nuts, making a "Brain Workers' Panacea" tonic called
                    Coca-Cola.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Touted to relieve mental and physical exhaustion, "Coke"
                    arrived alongside a wave of cocaine products advertised to
                    ease toothaches and labor pains. Cocaine was said to cure
                    fatigue, nervousness, impotence, even addiction to morphine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the medical miracle soon changed into the story of a
                    crime epidemic. Cocaine's addictive properties were
                    discovered and its increased availability fueled racial
                    fears: cocaine made Negroes insane and murderous; Jewish
                    doctors were identified as its peddlers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The United States began prohibition of coca leaf, along with
                    the cocaine it produces, with the Harrison Narcotics Act of
                    1914.

                    Amid fears of a US recession, there seems to be growing
                    impatience among investors when it comes to the massive

                    many of these companies have put in AI technology, with the

                    A leading South Korean producer of electric vehicle
                    batteries has declared itself in crisis as its customers
                    struggle with disappointing EV sales in Europe and the US.

                    SK On, the world's fourth-largest EV battery maker behind
                    Chinese giants CATL and BYD and South Korean rival LG Energy
                    Solution, has recorded losses for 10 consecutive quarters
                    since being spun off by its parent company in 2021. Its net
                    debt has increased more than fivefold, from Won2.9tn
                    ($2.1bn) to Won15.6tn over the same period, as western EV
                    sales have fallen far short of its expectations.

                    With losses snowballing, chief executive Lee Seok-hee
                    announced a series of cost-cutting and working practice
                    measures last Monday, describing them as a state of
                    "emergency management".

                    [...] SK On has made a series of aggressive investments in
                    the US and Europe in recent years, betting on a widely
                    predicted boom in demand for EVs. However, it has since
                    announced extended lay-offs for workers at its plant in the
                    US state of Georgia and delayed launching a second plant in
                    Kentucky, a joint venture with its principal US customer
                    Ford.

                Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a new
                type of 3D printer that knits 3-dimensional solid objects,
                according to a new paper published in ACM Transactions on
                Graphics. From the introduction:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Unlike standard knitting, which makes hollow surfaces, solid
                    knitting makes dense volumes by layering knit sheets—much as
                    3D printers layer plastic sheets. We envision a future where
                    everyday objects like furniture or shoes—including soles—can
                    be knit as one piece. Since the layers are topologically
                    intertwined during fabrication, solid dense volume knitting
                    requires no adhesives, allowing fabricated objects to be
                    unraveled easily to recover the constituent yarn

                    X is suing a group of major advertisers over accusations
                    that they held an "illegal boycott" against the platform
                    formerly known as Twitter. In a lawsuit filed on Tuesday, X
                    claims Unilever, Mars, CVS, Ørsted, and dozens of other
                    brands conspired to "collectively withhold billions of
                    dollars in advertising revenue" through a World Federation
                    of Advertisers (WFA) industry initiative.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To join the WFA's initiative, called the Global Alliance for
                    Responsible Media (GARM), companies must agree to withhold
                    advertising from social platforms that aren't compliant with
                    the organization's safety standards. X alleges GARM
                    "organized an advertiser boycott of Twitter" to coerce the
                    company into following the initiative's safety standards.
                    The lawsuit is being filed despite X announcing that it was
                    "excited" to rejoin GARM last month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The evidence and facts are on our side," X CEO Linda
                    Yaccarino said in a video posted to X. "They conspired to
                    boycott X, which threatens our ability to thrive in the
                    future. That puts your global Town Square — the one place
                    that you can express yourself freely and openly — at
                    long-term risk."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It's not clear how well X's lawsuit will fare in court
                    because, as pointed out by Techdirt, the ability to choose
                    where to advertise is protected under the First Amendment.
                    The ad tech watchdog group Check My Ads similarly states
                    that advertisers have the right "to not send money to a
                    platform that promotes hate and conspiracies."

                    Legal experts say the case is unlikely to succeed as any
                    collusion or agreement between companies will be hard to
                    prove.

                    [...] Musk's lawsuit is based on a recent investigation of
                    Garm led by the judiciary committee of the
                    Republican-controlled US House of Representatives. It was
                    filed in an obscure federal court branch in Texas known for
                    a particular conservative judge. X's lawyer is a well-known
                    rightwing legal figure, not a big national law firm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] X's business issues are real enough. According to the
                    New York Times, X ad revenue in the US has collapsed to
                    $114mn in a recent quarter. Total group global revenue for
                    Twitter in 2021 was $5bn. The company has a $13bn debt pile
                    where annual interest expense is well above $1bn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Advertisers decided that, since there were only a
                    handful of dominant social networks, they needed to band
                    together in order to enforce standards. Garm and the
                    companies will have to show that while they perhaps
                    co-ordinated on some matters, there was nothing binding
                    about their alliance when it came to economic decisions. It
                    would be decidedly odd for any company to surrender their
                    autonomy to a trade association. Musk's burden is higher,
                    explaining exactly why profit-seeking companies would
                    irrationally avoid his product.

              <p>
                Raspberry Pi have released the small Pico 2 as an improvement to
                the original Pico:
                <a
                  href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-2-our-new-5-microcontroller-board-on-sale-now/"

                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                The small single board computer looks virtually unchanged from
                its predecessor. All improvement is in a new microcontroller
                unit, the RP2350, which replaces the old RP2040. Most notable
                features are twice the memory, low power sleep options, and two
                added Risc-V cores. The two ARM cores are still there, but
                upgraded to Cortex-M33 from M0+.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike the RP2040, the new MCU is available in different
                packages, with more pins and flash memory in-package. Top of the
                line will be the RP2354B with 80 pins and 2MB integrated flash.
              </p>

                (Ed note: My first computer ran at 1 MHz and had only 4K bytes
                of memory. We've come a long way since then! --MartyB)! )

                    people as a place for them to connect with friends, find

                    [...] Meta has long faced scrutiny for its policies on
                    minors. It is being sued by 33 states accusing it of
                    deploying 'manipulative' practices toward young users, which
                    it denies. Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission is also
                    seeking to ban Meta from making money from teen audiences as
                    part of an update to an existing privacy settlement, which
                    the company is challenging in court.

                    [...] Spark was working on behalf of the Meta marketing data
                    science team and was tasked with getting more "Gen Z"
                    customers to download Instagram, which has been losing users
                    to rival apps, in particular TikTok, internal documents

                    [...] On its website, Google says the "unknown" group
                    "refers to people whose age, gender, parental status or
                    household income we haven't identified." But staff at the
                    Internet group had thousands of data points on everything
                    from users' location via phone masts to their app downloads
                    and activity online. This allowed them to determine with a
                    high degree of confidence that those in the "unknown" group
                    included many younger users, in particular under-18s.

                    Turning off other age groups for which they had demographic
                    data left only the unknown group, with its high proportion
                    of minors and children: it was described as a way of
                    "hacking" the audience safeguards in their system, one of
                    the people said.

                    [...] During the pitching process, another email from Spark
                    in late 2023 asked Google to provide Meta with
                    "platform-specific data and insights into teen behavior."
                    This would "enable us to tailor and refine our media
                    tactics, messaging and creative execution," it read.

                  <p>
                    As part of its pitch, Google also boasted of its "really
                    impressive" usage by 13- to 17-year-olds, handily
                    outstripping daily engagement on TikTok and Instagram,
                    documents show.

                  <p>
                    Google won the mandate from Spark, and the teams on both
                    sides took precautions, banning any direct reference to the
                    age range in writing, one of the people said. Staff used
                    euphemisms in presentations, such as slides with only the
                    words "embrace the unknown," according to documents reviewed
                    by the FT.

                    Each August, the Perseid meteor shower provides a
                    breathtaking sight of bright meteors and fireballs, best
                    viewed in the early hours of August 12. These meteors,
                    hitting atmospheric speeds up to 132,000 mph, are part of a
                    display originating from Comet Swift-Tuttle.

                    daylight fireball over New York City, but stargazers can
                    still anticipate seeing some shooting stars with the
                    upcoming Perseid meteor shower. Caused by Earth passing

                    at the agency’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
                    Alabama. “Not only is the shower rich in bright meteors and
                    fireballs – No. 1 in fact – it also peaks in mid-August when
                    the weather is still warm and comfortable. This year, the
                    Perseid maximum will occur on the night of August 11 and
                    pre-dawn hours of August 12. You’ll start seeing meteors
                    from the shower around 11 p.m. local time and the rates will
                    increase until dawn. If you miss the night of the 11th, you
                    will also be able to see quite a few on the night of the
                    12th between those times.”

                  <p>
                    The best way to see the Perseids is to find the darkest
                    possible sky and visit between midnight and dawn on the
                    morning of August 12. Allow about 45 minutes for your eyes
                    to adjust to the dark. Lie on your back and look straight
                    up. Avoid looking at cell phones or tablets because their
                    bright screens ruin night vision and take your eyes off the
                    sky.

                    Perseid meteors travel at the blistering speed of 132,000
                    mph – or 500 times faster than the fastest car in the world.
                    At that speed, even a smidgen of dust makes a vivid streak
                    of light when it collides with Earth’s atmosphere. Peak
                    temperatures can exceed 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit as they
                    speed across the sky. The Perseids pose no danger to people
                    on the ground as practically all burn up 60 miles above our
                    planet.

                    >
                    was recorded at 9:48 p.m. EDT on July 23. The meteor – about
                    as bright as the planet Jupiter, so not quite bright enough
                    to be considered a fireball – was caused by a piece of Comet
                    Swift-Tuttle about 5 millimeters in diameter entering the
                    atmosphere over the Atlantic and burning up 66 miles above
                    St. Cloud, Florida, just south of Orlando.

                    It wasn’t part of the Perseids, but a rare daylight fireball
                    streaked across the sky over New York City at 11:15 a.m. EDT
                    on Tuesday, July 16. The event gained national attention and
                    was reported in media outlets across the U.S.

                    31 miles above Mountainside, New Jersey. Cooke said the
                    meteor was likely about 1 foot in diameter, which would have
                    made the rock bright enough to see during the day. Seeing a
                    meteor of this size is rarer than catching sight of the
                    smaller particles a few millimeters in size typically seen
                    in the night sky.

                    Ph.D. student and lead author, Tian Du, also from the
                    University of Sydney, said, "Heparin is inexpensive,
                    ubiquitous and a World Health Organization-listed Essential
                    Medicine. After successful human trials, it could be rolled
                    out relatively quickly to become a cheap, safe and effective
                    drug for treating cobra bites."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team used CRISPR to find the human genes that cobra
                    venom needs to cause necrosis that kills the flesh around
                    the bite. One of the required venom targets are enzymes
                    needed to produce the related molecules heparan and heparin,
                    which many human and animal cells produce.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Heparan is on the cell surface and heparin is released
                    during an immune response. Their similar structure means the
                    venom can bind to both. The team used this knowledge to make
                    an antidote that can stop necrosis in human cells and mice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unlike current antivenoms for cobra bites, which are 19th
                    century technologies, the heparinoid drugs act as a 'decoy'
                    antidote. By flooding the bite site with 'decoy' heparin
                    sulfate or related heparinoid molecules, the antidote can
                    bind to and neutralize the toxins within the venom that
                    cause tissue damage.

                    Interventions at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,
                    said, "Snakebites remain the deadliest of the neglected
                    tropical diseases, with its burden landing overwhelmingly on
                    rural communities in low- and middle-income countries.

                  <p>
                    "Our findings are exciting because current antivenoms are
                    largely ineffective against severe local envenoming, which
                    involves painful progressive swelling, blistering and/or
                    tissue necrosis around the bite site. This can lead to loss
                    of limb function, amputation and lifelong disability."

                    The researchers sought to determine whether parents choose a
                    baby name based on what seems fitting for the baby's
                    appearance, or if the process is the other way around —
                    that, over the years, the individual's facial appearance
                    changes to match the name given to them by their parents.

                  <p>
                    A new study reveals that a person's face tends to evolve to
                    suit their name, demonstrating the profound impact of social
                    expectations. The research showed that adults' faces could
                    be matched to their names with high accuracy, while
                    children's faces could not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Machine learning also found significant similarities among
                    adults with the same name. This effect, known as a
                    self-fulfilling prophecy, suggests that social constructs
                    can influence physical appearance over time.

                    In 1949, the Chrysler Corporation introduced a new disc
                    brake system, but it was nothing like the disc brakes we
                    know today. Here's how it worked.
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    As we can see, the Ausco Lambert bears no similarity to the
                    caliper-type disc brakes developed for aircraft in the
                    1940s, or those later adopted by Crosley, Dunlop, and
                    ultimately the entire auto industry. In its basic
                    configuration, the Lambert design sort of resembles the
                    familiar clutch-disc and pressure-plate arrangment for a
                    conventional manual transmission (as do the Milan and
                    Kinmont brakes) but there are some important differences
                    there, too.

                    The accused CEO of the site, Roman Boss – who also uses the
                    surname Pikulev – is a Russian national living in Germany.
                    He is said to have set up the exchange in December 2013,
                    using the email address trucksale@gmail.com.

                    contact@cryptonator.com to a financial institution with the
                    note: "I'm Roman, CEO of Cryptonator."

                  <p>
                    In a sting operation in July, 2021, a FBI operative in
                    Florida registered an account with Cryptonator. The agent
                    spent around $4,195 in digicash at a known dark web site
                    that, it's claimed, trades in stolen identification records.
                    Court documents allege that Boss facilitated that purchase
                    via Cryptonator, telling the agent all transactions were
                    anonymous and currency would be "mixed" at his end to
                    disguise its source.

                    In September another FBI agent, who had been operating
                    undercover as an affiliate of a known ransomware group, is
                    said to have used a Cryptonator account to offer the
                    criminals fictitious stolen data in exchange for a cut of
                    the proceeds. That agent received Bitcoin worth $14,500 in
                    two transactions through Cryptonator, it's said.

                    Boss is charged with two offenses: Operating an unlicensed
                    money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit money
                    laundering. The DoJ and IRS are seeking his arrest and the
                    forfeiture of any and all illegal funds. Neither agency has

                    NASA officials said on Wednesday the two astronauts
                    delivered to the International Space Station in June by
                    Boeing's Starliner could return on SpaceX's Crew Dragon in
                    February 2025 if Starliner is still deemed unsafe to return
                    to Earth.

                    The U.S. space agency has been discussing potential plans
                    with SpaceX to leave two seats empty on an upcoming Crew
                    Dragon launch for NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni
                    Williams, who became the first crew to fly Boeing's
                    Starliner capsule.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The astronauts' test mission, initially expected to last
                    about eight days on the station, has been drawn out by
                    issues on Starliner's propulsion system that have
                    increasingly called into question the spacecraft's ability
                    to safely return them to Earth as planned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Boeing spokesperson said if NASA decides to change
                    Starliner's mission, the company "will take the actions
                    necessary to configure Starliner for an uncrewed return."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thruster failures during Starliner's initial approach to the
                    ISS in June and several leaks of helium – used to pressurize
                    those thrusters – have set Boeing off on a testing campaign
                    to understand the cause and propose fixes to NASA, which has
                    the final say. Recent results have unearthed new
                    information, causing greater alarm about a safe return.

                    The latest test data have stirred disagreements and debate
                    within NASA about whether to accept the risk of a Starliner
                    return to Earth, or make the call to use Crew Dragon
                    instead.

                    Using a SpaceX craft to return astronauts that Boeing had
                    planned to bring back on Starliner would be a major blow to
                    an aerospace giant that has struggled for years to compete
                    with SpaceX and its more experienced Crew Dragon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Starliner has been docked to the ISS for 63 of the maximum
                    90 days it can stay, and it is parked at the same port that
                    Crew Dragon will have to use to deliver the upcoming
                    astronaut crew.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Early Tuesday morning, NASA, using a SpaceX rocket and a
                    Northrop Grumman capsule, delivered a routine shipment of
                    food and supplies to the station, including extra clothes
                    for Wilmore and Williams.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Starliner's high-stakes mission is a final test required
                    before NASA can certify the spacecraft for routine astronaut
                    flights to and from the ISS. Crew Dragon received NASA
                    approval for astronaut flights in 2020.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Starliner development has been set back by management issues
                    and numerous engineering problems. It has cost Boeing $1.6
                    billion since 2016, including $125 million from Starliner's
                    current test mission, securities filings show.

                    if it can stick to its previously announced schedule. This
                    fix should be available via BIOS updates from PC and
                    motherboard makers and from Microsoft as a Windows update.
                    But it will take time for those updates to roll out to
                    users, and Intel has said that processors that are already
                    exhibiting crashes have been permanently damaged and won't
                    be fixed by the microcode update.

                    In an effort to provide peace of mind to buyers and cover
                    anyone whose CPU is subtly damaged but not showing explicit
                    signs of instability, Intel is extending the warranty on all
                    affected 13th- and 14th-generation CPUs by an additional two
                    years, Tom's Hardware

                    three years to five, and it applies to both previously
                    purchased processors and new ones that are bought from today
                    onward. For processors that came installed in pre-built PCs,
                    Intel says users are covered, but that they should reach out
                    to their PC's manufacturer for support. Those customers
                    should only contact Intel directly if they have a problem
                    getting a new CPU from the PC company.

                    [...] According to Intel, the root cause of the issue was "a
                    microcode algorithm resulting in incorrect voltage requests
                    to the processor," a bug that caused motherboards to supply
                    too much power to a CPU. This resulted in damage to the
                    silicon over time, leading to crashing and instability. The

                    [...] We all know this crap doesn't work and the sooner we
                    can stop pretending it makes a difference, the better.
                    AT&amp;T had every certification on the planet and still
                    didn't take the <em>incredibly</em> basic step of enforcing
                    2FA on a database of all the most sensitive data it has in
                    the world. If following these stupid checklists and
                    purchasing the required software ended up with more secure
                    platforms, I'd say "well at least there is a payoff". But
                    time after time we see the exact same thing which is an
                    audit is not an adequate replacement for someone who knows
                    what they are doing looking at your stack and asking hard
                    questions about your process. These audits aren't resulting
                    in organizations doing the hard but necessary step of taking
                    downtime to patch critical flaws or even applying basic
                    security settings across all of their platforms.

                  <p>
                    [...] I don't know what the solution is, but I know this
                    song and dance isn't working. The world would be better off
                    if organizations stopped wasting so much time and money on
                    these vendor solutions and instead stuck to
                    <em>much more basic</em> solutions. Perhaps if we could just
                    start with "have we patched all the critical CVEs in our
                    organization" and "did we remove the shared username and
                    password from the cloud database with millions of call
                    records", then perhaps AFTER all the actual work is done we
                    can have some fun and inject dangerous software into the
                    most critical parts of our employees devices.
