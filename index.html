                An interesting tidbit mentioned was that even notable
                statisticians such as
                <a
                  href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Pearson/"
                  >Karl Pearson</a
                >
                did their own experiments:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Throughout history, several researchers have collected
                    thousands of coin flips. In the 18th century, the famed
                    naturalist Count de Buffon collected 2,048 uninterrupted
                    sequences of 'heads' in what is possibly the first
                    statistical experiment ever conducted. In the 19th century,
                    the statistician Karl Pearson flipped a coin 24,000 times to
                    obtain 12,012 tails. And in the 20th century, the
                    mathematician John Kerrich flipped a coin 10,000 times for a
                    total of 5,067 heads while interned in Nazi-occupied
                    Denmark. These experiments do not allow a test of the D-H-M
                    model, however, mostly because it was not recorded whether
                    the coin landed on the same side that it started. A notable
                    exception is a sequence of 40,000 coin flips collected by
                    Janet Larwood and Priscilla Ku in 2009: Larwood always
                    started the flips heads-up, and Ku always tails-up.
                    Unfortunately, the results (<em>i.e</em>., 10,231/20,000
                    heads by Larwood and 10,014/20,000 tails by Ku) do not
                    provide compelling evidence for or against the D-H-M
                    hypothesis.
                  </p>

                So now that you know how to bet, will this help you make money?
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>

                    Could future coin tossers use the same-side bias to their
                    advantage? The magnitude of the observed bias can be
                    illustrated using a betting scenario. If you bet a dollar on
                    the outcome of a coin toss (<em>i.e</em>., paying 1 dollar
                    to enter, and winning either 0 or 2 dollars depending on the
                    outcome) and repeat the bet 1,000 times, knowing the
                    starting position of the coin toss would earn you 19 dollars
                    on average. This is more than the casino advantage for 6
                    deck blackjack against an optimal-strategy player, where the
                    casino would make 5 dollars on a comparable bet, but less
                    than the casino advantage for single-zero roulette, where
                    the casino would make 27 dollars on average. These
                    considerations lead us to suggest that when coin flips are
                    used for high-stakes decision-making, the starting position
                    of the coin is best concealed.

                    An extreme drought in parts of the Amazon has led to a
                    dramatic drop in river water levels, exposing dozens of
                    usually submerged rock formations with carvings of human
                    forms that may date back some 2,000 years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The rock carvings are not usually visible because they
                    are covered by the waters of the Negro River, whose flow
                    recorded its lowest level in 121 years last week.

                  <p>
                    The surfacing of the engravings on the riverbank have
                    delighted scientists and the general public alike but also
                    raised unsettling questions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We come, we look at (the engravings) and we think they are
                    beautiful. But at the same time, it is worrying... I also
                    think about whether this river will exist in 50 or 100
                    years," Ribeiro said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to experts, the dry season has worsened this
                    year due to El Niño, an irregular climate pattern over the
                    Pacific Ocean that disrupts normal weather, adding to the
                    effect of climate change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The engravings comprise an archaeological site of "great
                    relevance," said Jaime Oliveira of the Brazilian Institute
                    of Historical Heritage (Iphan).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Most of the engravings are of human faces, some of
                    them rectangular and others oval, with smiles or grim
                    expressions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The site expresses emotions, feelings, it is an engraved
                    rock record, but it has something in common with current
                    works of art," said Oliveira.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Beatriz Carneiro, historian and member of Iphan, Praia
                    das Lajes has an "inestimable" value in understanding the
                    first people who inhabited the region, a field still little
                    explored.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Unhappily it is now reappearing with the worsening of the
                    drought," Carneiro said. "Having our rivers back (flooded)
                    and keeping the engravings submerged will help preserve
                    them, even more than our work."

                    TSMC has already declared victory over the US company, with
                    plans to introduce comparable manufacturing technology

                    confirmed the enhancements of the N3P technology. TSMC's
                    3nm-class manufacturing node demonstrated "comparable PPA"
                    (power performance area) to Intel's 18A node. N3P is
                    expected to be even better, arriving earlier on the market,
                    boasting "better technology maturity," and offering
                    significant cost advantages.

                  <p>
                    Wei emphasized that TSMC doesn't underestimate or take the
                    competition lightly. He also mentioned that the company's
                    2-nanometer technology, while still a work in progress, is
                    expected to surpass both N3P and 18A. TSMC's

                  <p>
                    [...] Wei mentioned that N3 is expected to contribute to a
                    "mid-single-digit percentage" of TSMC's total wafer revenue
                    in 2023, with a significantly higher percentage anticipated
                    for 2024. There is strong demand for 3nm products from
                    various customers who are seeking improved performance,
                    power efficiency, yield, and "comprehensive platform
                    support" for both high-performance computing (HPC) and
                    smartphone applications.

                  <p>
                    According to Malwarebytes, which spotted the Notepad++
                    malvertising campaign, it has been live for several months
                    but managed to fly under the radar all this time.

                    The final payload delivered to victims is unknown, but
                    Malwarebytes says it's most likely Cobalt Strike, which
                    usually precedes highly damaging ransomware deployments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Notepad++ malvertizing campaign promotes URLs that are
                    obviously unrelated to the software project yet use
                    misleading titles displayed in Google Search result
                    advertisements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Once victims click on any of the ads, a redirection
                    step checks their IP to filter out users likely to be
                    crawlers, VPNs, bots, etc., leading them to a decoy site
                    that does not drop anything malicious.

                  <p>
                    In contrast, legitimate targets are redirected to
                    "notepadxtreme[.]com" which mimics the real Notepad++ site,
                    featuring download links for various versions of the text
                    editor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Victims who are marked as suitable targets are then
                    served an HTA script, which is assigned a unique ID, likely
                    to enable the attackers to track their infections. That
                    payload is served only once per victim, so a second visit
                    results in a 404 error.

                    [...] But experiments on reproduction do not necessarily
                    need to involve human samples. Jeffrey Alberts wants to see
                    several generations of animals like rats be born in space,
                    live their entire lives there, and reproduce. Such
                    experiments have never been performed and would be the
                    definitive test of whether there are any multigenerational
                    effects of life in space—an outstanding question highlighted
                    by the National Academies report.

                  <p>
                    The results of such studies would reveal a lot about whether
                    space settlements could ever become a reality. But to
                    Edelbroek, the fact that multigenerational studies on
                    animals have never been approved is the raison d'être for
                    his company. And while its research might make some people
                    uncomfortable, he sees pushing the boundaries as important.

                    "Humanity has benefited all the time from expanding her

                    continue to do that into space."

                    Apple's new iPhone 15 marks a disruptive departure from
                    previous models. The 11-year reign of the Lightning cable is
                    over, and the USB-C era has begun — leaving us wondering
                    what sets one charger apart from another.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Does Apple's Thunderbolt 4 cable really warrant its $129
                    price tag? Or does a $5 cable get the job done just as well?
                    We've used our Neptune industrial X-ray CT scanner to
                    uncover the hidden engineering differences between them.

                explains some of the confusion around USB-C. Unfortunately the
                article is very light on details, but the pictures are
                interesting.

                    NASA's Lucy spacecraft is preparing for its first close-up
                    look at an asteroid. On Nov. 1, it will fly by asteroid
                    Dinkinesh and test its instruments in preparation for visits
                    in the next decade to multiple Trojan asteroids that circle
                    the sun in the same orbit as Jupiter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dinkinesh, less than half a mile, or 1 kilometer, wide,
                    circles the sun in the main belt of asteroids located
                    between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Lucy has been
                    visually tracking Dinkinesh since Sept. 3; it will be the
                    first of 10 asteroids Lucy will visit on its 12-year voyage.
                    To observe so many, Lucy will not stop or orbit the
                    asteroids, instead it will collect data as it speeds past
                    them in what is called a "flyby."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is the first time Lucy will be getting a close look at
                    an object that, up to this point, has only been an
                    unresolved smudge in the best telescopes," said Hal Levison,
                    Lucy principal investigator from the Southwest Research
                    Institute, which is headquartered in San Antonio. "Dinkinesh
                    is about to be revealed to humanity for the first time."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The primary aim of the Lucy mission, which launched Oct. 16,
                    2021, is to survey the Jupiter Trojan asteroids, a
                    never-before-explored population of small bodies that orbit
                    the sun in two "swarms" that lead and follow Jupiter in its
                    orbit. However, before Lucy gets to the Trojans, it will fly
                    by another main belt asteroid in 2025 called Donaldjohanson
                    for additional in-flight tests of the spacecraft systems and
                    procedures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] After the Dinkinesh encounter, the Lucy spacecraft
                    will continue in its orbit around the sun, returning to the
                    Earth's vicinity for its second gravity assist in December
                    2024. This push from Earth will send it back to the main
                    asteriod belt for its 2025 Donaldjohanson flyby, and then on
                    to the Jupiter Trojan asteroids in 2027.

                    destruction programs. At a news conference in St. Louis,
                    Missouri, the FBI alleged that thousands of individuals have
                    moved to countries such as Russia and China and posed as
                    freelance IT workers living in the US. Companies in St.

                  <p>
                    The bad actors used false information for emails, payment

                    weapons programs, some workers also hacked their employers'
                    computer networks to take private information and leave the
                    possibility for other schemes, such as extortion.

                    Special Agent in Charge Jay Greenberg of the FBI St. Louis
                    Division went so far as to say that any company that employs
                    freelance IT workers "more than likely" hired one of these
                    bad actors. "This scheme is so prevalent that companies must
                    be vigilant to verify whom they're hiring," Greenberg
                    stated. "At a minimum, the FBI recommends that employers
                    take additional proactive steps with remote IT workers to
                    make it harder for bad actors to hide their identities.
                    Without due diligence, companies risk losing money or being
                    compromised by insider threats they unknowingly invited
                    inside their systems."

                    Pepper X measures an average of 2.693 million Scoville Heat
                    Units. A jalapeño, by comparison, measures just 2,000 to
                    8,000 SHUs, while a serrano can land between 10,000 and
                    23,000 SHUs.

                    head kind of feels like, 'Oh no! What's going on?' And then
                    your body just starts reacting. You get it in your arms, you
                    get it in your chest," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It has no real throat burn like the Reaper, but that comes
                    on later when you're in pain."

                    to date, which could be used to measure the matter between
                    galaxies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers first discovered the energy burst in June
                    2022 with the Australia Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder
                    (ASKAP) telescope. It is believed that the energy was
                    created from a powerful cosmic event that released the
                    equivalent of 30 years of our sun’s total emission in
                    milliseconds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The astronomers claim that this burst of energy is
                    older and further away than any other fast radio burst
                    detected to date. It is believed to have originated from a
                    small group of merging galaxies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team said that current methods for estimating the
                    mass of the universe give conflicting answers and challenge
                    the standard model of cosmology. But the latest discovery
                    suggests that these radio bursts can be used to measure the
                    “missing” matter between galaxies to accurately weigh up the
                    universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “If we count up the amount of normal matter in the Universe
                    – the atoms that we are all made of – we find that more than
                    half of what should be there today is missing,” said Prof
                    Ryan Shannon who co-led the study. “We think that the
                    missing matter is hiding in the space between galaxies, but
                    it may just be so hot and diffuse that it’s impossible to
                    see using normal techniques.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team said that in 2020, the late Australian astronomer
                    Jean-Pierre Macquart showed that fast radio bursts reveal
                    more diffuse gases between galaxies if they are further
                    away. The team claims their latest discovery helps to
                    confirm this Macquart relation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “While we still don’t know what causes these massive bursts
                    of energy, the paper confirms that fast radio bursts are
                    common events in the cosmos and that we will be able to use
                    them to detect matter between galaxies, and better
                    understand the structure of the universe.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the team believes that the latest result represents
                    the limit of what we can spot with modern telescopes and
                    that more powerful devices will be needed to measure more
                    distant fast radio bursts.

                    Two men this week confessed to deliberately bypassing
                    testing protocols that are essential to keeping nuclear
                    power plants safe. This happened not once, not twice, but
                    <em>29 times.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Miguel Marcial Amaro, 56, from Delaware, and Martin Ramos,
                    52, from Pennsylvania, both pleaded guilty to a single count
                    of making and using a materially false document, and aiding
                    and abetting the same, for their respective roles in
                    creating false calibration certs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And it wasn't just one nuclear plant where Marcial and Ramos
                    were cutting corners. According to the Justice Department's
                    Environment and Natural Resources Division, the duo faked
                    certs that would show acoustic emissions (AE) testing had
                    been done by calibrated instruments in several plants over a
                    period that stretched for over a decade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AE testing is important as it's how engineers can check the
                    structural integrity of components without shaking, moving,
                    or otherwise impacting their serviceability. The pair were
                    responsible for ascertaining their employer's AE testing kit
                    was compliant, with Marcial ensuring the equipment was
                    calibrated annually, and Ramos working under Marcial as an
                    engineer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Justice Department said in a felony notice filed
                    on September 25 that the AE testing equipment was used to
                    determine, "among other things, the structural integrity of
                    heavy-lifting components, such as cranes and rigging, that
                    handled critical components of a nuclear reactor, including
                    nuclear fuel."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AE testing works by mounting small sensors onto a component.
                    The component emits stress waves when you apply an external
                    stimulus, such as high pressure, loads, or temperatures. The
                    sensors detect these waves as they are emitted, converts
                    them into electrical signals, and then relays these to a
                    computer for processing. The notice adds that the process
                    assesses the structural integrity of components, including
                    whether there was any "infirmity, weakness, or damage."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The pair are scheduled to be sentenced on January 25
                    next year, with a federal district court judge determining
                    the length, which is max five years. The original indictment
                    is not public and it is not known what the men's motivation
                    for their actions could be.

                    The way you talk can reveal a lot about you—especially if
                    you're talking to a chatbot. New research reveals that
                    chatbots like ChatGPT can infer a lot of sensitive
                    information about the people they chat with, even if the
                    conversation is utterly mundane.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The phenomenon appears to stem from the way the models'
                    algorithms are trained with broad swathes of web content, a
                    key part of what makes them work, likely making it hard to
                    prevent. "It's not even clear how you fix this problem,"
                    says

                    alarming amount of personal information about
                    users—including their race, location, occupation, and
                    more—from conversations that appear innocuous.<br />[...]<br />Researchers

                    scrub personal information from training data or block
                    models from outputting it. Vechev says the ability of LLMs
                    to infer personal information is fundamental to how they
                    work by finding statistical correlations, which will make it
                    far more difficult to address. "This is very different," he
                    says. "It is much worse."

                    However, opponents are calling it a power grab. Commissioner
                    Brendan Carr points to the 2017 repeal and the fact that the
                    internet "<a
                      href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-397801A1.pdf"
                      >didn't break</a
                    >" as an example of why the rules are unnecessary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When my FCC colleagues and I voted in 2017 to overturn the
                    Obama Administration's failed, two-year experiment with
                    Title II, activists and politicians alike guaranteed the
                    American public that the internet would quite literally
                    break without it," Carr said in a Wednesday statement, a day
                    before the vote. "Since that didn't happen, the FCC
                    shouldn't reimpose the rules now. We already have a free and
                    open internet today, without Title II."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Evan Swarztrauber, Senior Advisor at the
                    <a href="https://www.thefai.org/"
                      >Foundation for American Innovation</a
                    >, agrees with Carr. He points out that the fear-mongering
                    rhetoric failed to materialize after the 2017 repeal, and
                    internet service got better and cheaper when adjusted for
                    inflation. Swarztrauber also believes that the FCC is
                    barking up the wrong tree.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Even though the Title II rules passed the vote, the
                    issue is far from over. The Commission will now open the
                    proposal up for public

                    presentations and critiques. After peer review and potential
                    revisions prompted by sound arguments and feedback, the FCC
                    will vote again.

                    If passed, it will most assuredly face legal challenges just
                    as the first implementation and the subsequent repeal did.
                    In both cases, the courts upheld the FCC's decision, saying
                    that the agency can

                    NASA announced on Thursday that the first-ever crewed test
                    flight of Boeing's much-delayed Starliner spacecraft will
                    launch no earlier than mid-April, 2024.

                    The mission – dubbed Crew Flight Test (CFT) – will see test
                    pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni William travel to the
                    International Space Station (ISS) and back to try out
                    Boeing's reusable capsule. The Starliner will be launched on
                    a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral
                    Space Force Station in Florida and transport the astronauts
                    on an eight-day trip.

                    ISS. Both firms struggled with multiple setbacks that

                    SpaceX is up and running, having first launched astronauts
                    into space in 2020, and is due to fly its eighth mission in
                    February next year.

                    [...] Meanwhile, the mechanism that connects the parachute
                    to the capsule – needed to slow the Starliner's speed so it
                    can safely land on Earth – has had to be redesigned after it
                    broke apart in tests. The issue has plagued Boeing for a
                    while, and was one of the main reasons it had to push back
                    its first-ever crewed flight back in June.

                    After more than 40 years studying humans and other primates,
                    Sapolsky has reached the conclusion that virtually all human
                    behaviour is as far beyond our conscious control as the
                    convulsions of a seizure, the division of cells or the
                    beating of our hearts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This means accepting that a man who shoots into a crowd has
                    no more control over his fate than the victims who happen to
                    be in the wrong place at the wrong time. It means treating
                    drunk drivers who barrel into pedestrians just like drivers
                    who suffer a sudden heart attack and veer out of their lane.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sapolsky, a MacArthur "genius" grant winner, is extremely
                    aware that this is an out-there position. Most
                    neuroscientists believe humans have at least some degree of
                    free will. So do most philosophers and the vast majority of
                    the general population. Free will is essential to how we see
                    ourselves, fueling the satisfaction of achievement or the
                    shame of failing to do the right thing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Analyzing human behavior through the lens of any
                    single discipline leaves room for the possibility that
                    people choose their actions, he says. But after a long
                    cross-disciplinary career, he feels it's intellectually
                    dishonest to write anything other than what he sees as the
                    unavoidable conclusion: Free will is a myth, and the sooner
                    we accept that, the more just our society will be.

                    which comes out today, builds on Sapolsky's 2017 bestseller
                    "Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst," which
                    won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and a slew of other
                    accolades.

                    {...]: We are machines, Sapolsky argues, exceptional in our
                    ability to perceive our own experiences and feel emotions
                    about them. It is pointless to hate a machine for its
                    failures.

                  <p>There is only one last thread he can't resolve.</p>
                  <p>
                    "It is logically indefensible, ludicrous, meaningless to
                    believe that something 'good' can happen to a machine," he
                    writes. "Nonetheless, I am certain that it is good if people
                    feel less pain and more happiness."

                  <p>
                    According to The Times, there are several issues with access
                    to public trial exhibits on both sides. The Department of
                    Justice has failed to post at least 68 exhibits on its
                    website that were shared in the trial, The Times alleged,
                    and states have not provided access to 18 records despite
                    reporters' requests.<br />[...]<br />Currently, The Times
                    said it is seeking to unseal redactions in two exhibits, and
                    it remains "unclear why the exhibits have been redacted"
                    because "they date to 2007 and relate to a version of an
                    agreement between Apple and Google that has not been
                    operative for more than a decade."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps most notably, The Times has also asked the court to
                    unseal testimony
                    <a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The Court has upheld redactions to certain transcripts in
                    the absence of a showing by the parties on the public record
                    that the sealing is justified and without providing its own
                    'full explanation of the basis for the redactions," The
                    Times alleged, "even though some of the redactions have been
                    applied to material that is both of great public interest
                    and goes to the core of the litigation."

                    The sleight of hand that allowed the imposter site
                    xn--eepass-vbb[.]info to appear as ķeepass[.]info is an

                    standard ASCII text. Looking carefully, it's easy to spot
                    the small comma-like figure immediately below the k. When it
                    appears in an address bar, the figure is equally easy to
                    miss, especially when the URL is backed by a valid TLS

                    The use of punycode-enhanced malware scams has a long

                    pushing a fake, malicious version of the browser. The
                    punycode technique first came to widespread attention in
                    2017, when a Web application developer created a

                    Being announced today by AMD for a November 21st launch,
                    this morning AMD is taking the wraps off of their Ryzen 7000
                    Threadripper CPUs. These high-end chips are being split up
                    into two product lines, with AMD assembling the
                    workstation-focused Ryzen Threadripper 7000 Pro series, as
                    well as the non-pro Ryzen Threadripper 7000 series for the
                    more consumer-ish high-end desktop (HEDT) market. Both chip
                    lines are based on AMD's tried and true Zen 4 architecture –
                    derivatives of AMD's EPYC server processors – incorporating
                    AMD's Zen 4 chiplets and a discrete I/O dies. As with
                    previous generations of Threadripper parts, we're
                    essentially looking at the desktop version of AMD's EPYC
                    hardware.

                    Then why is this method of dispersal not seen in other
                    insects? The Kobe University researcher explains, "The eggs
                    of most insect species are typically fertilized just before
                    being laid, relying on sperm stored within the female
                    insects after copulation. However, in some stick insect
                    species, females are parthenogenic, that is, they can
                    produce viable eggs without fertilization." It is only
                    because of this quirk in their nature that viable stick
                    insect babies can hatch from the eggs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is important to keep in mind that stick insects are
                    called that way precisely because their main strategy of
                    survival is not being eaten by their predators, as opposed
                    to many plants that rely on their fruit being ingested and
                    thus their seeds being dispersed by animals. Nevertheless,
                    Suetsugu explains the importance of this result for the
                    scientific community: "This finding invites researchers to
                    delve deeper into the mechanisms of dispersal in various
                    species and challenge long-held assumptions about the fate
                    of organisms devoured by predators."

                    Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) consume only about 10% of the
                    electricity required by traditional incandescent lights and
                    last up to 25 times longer, so it's no surprise that they
                    have become commonplace over the past two decades.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But there is a downside to LEDs: They're much brighter than
                    old-fashioned energy-guzzling light bulbs. When an entire
                    city gets fitted with energy-saving LED lamps, this bright
                    light scatters through
                    <a href="https://www.space.com/17683-earth-atmosphere.html"

                    and makes the sky glow with greater intensity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A study published earlier this year found that
                    <a
                      href="https://www.space.com/light-pollution-makes-stars-disappear"
                      >stars are disappearing from the sky</a
                    >
                    at an average rate of 10% per year. This trend affects even
                    the world's most remote observatories. Germany-based startup
                    StealthTransit recently tested a solution to this growing
                    issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Unfortunately, this problem haunts almost all observatories
                    today," Vlad Pashkovsky, StealthTransit's founder and CEO,
                    told Space.com in an email. "Modern telescopes are highly
                    sensitive and feel the impact of outdoor lighting of cities
                    located at the distance of 50 or even 200 kilometers [30 to
                    120 miles]. This means that virtually every observatory on
                    <a
                      href="https://www.space.com/54-earth-history-composition-and-atmosphere.html"

                    >
                    either already needs, or will need in the future 10 years,
                    protection from the light of large cities."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    StealthTransit's solution relies on three components: A
                    simple device that makes LED lights flicker at a very high
                    frequency that is imperceptible to the human eye, a GPS
                    receiver, and a specially designed shutter on the
                    telescope's camera that can blink in sync with the LED
                    lights. The GPS technology guides the telescope's shutter to
                    open only during the fleeting moments when the LED lights
                    are switched off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The experiments, conducted at an observatory in the Caucasus
                    Mountains in Russia, showed that the technology, dubbed the
                    DarkSkyProtector, could reduce unwanted sky glow in
                    astronomical images by 94%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It might sound impractical to refit an entire town
                    with devices that allow lamps to blink, but Pashkovsky said
                    that most existing LED lights can operate in the blinking
                    mode and that new lamps designed specifically with sky
                    protection in mind would be no costlier than existing LED
                    technology. The most expensive element of the
                    DarkSkyProtector system is the telescope shutter, which
                    needs to be lightweight and agile enough to blink about 150
                    times per second.

                    One of the most striking areas on Mars is its Noctis
                    Labyrinthus—Latin for the "Labyrinth of Night." It lies
                    between Mars's Valles Marineris and the gigantic volcanoes
                    of the Tharsis Bulge.

                    This shattered terrain is a system of valleys that stretch
                    out across nearly 1,200 kilometers. Scientists combined
                    ESA's Mars Express images into an amazing flyover of this
                    terrain, giving us a tasty hint of what future explorers
                    will see.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It's cool to think of Mars Express focusing a
                    high-resolution movie camera on the surface. However, this
                    movie comprises many individual images. The views come from
                    more than eight Mars Express orbits.

                  <p>
                    In addition to images, the team combined images with
                    topographic information from a digital terrain model. That
                    helped the visualization team generate a three-dimensional
                    landscape, with every second of the video comprising 50
                    separate frames rendered according to a pre-defined camera
                    path.

                  <p>
                    In addition to showing the ancient history of Mars terrain,
                    the video also shows some Mars Express history. The opening
                    credits (Mars globe, first 24 seconds) were created using
                    the recent 20-year Mars global color mosaic.

                    Haze has been added to conceal the limits of the terrain
                    model. It starts building up at a distance of between 150
                    and 200 km. The video is centered at the Martian coordinates
                    of 7°S, 265°E.

                  <p>
                    You might think of the Intel 386 processor (1985) as just an
                    early processor in the x86 line, but the 386 was a critical
                    turning point for modern computing in several ways.1 First,
                    the 386 moved the x86 architecture to 32 bits, defining the
                    dominant computing architecture for the rest of the 20th
                    century. The 386 also established the overwhelming
                    importance of x86, not just for Intel, but for the entire
                    computer industry. Finally, the 386 ended IBM's control over
                    the PC market, turning Compaq into the architectural leader.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The 80386 was a major advancement over the 286: it
                    implemented a 32-bit architecture, added more instructions,
                    and supported 4-gigabyte segments. The 386 is a complicated
                    processor (by 1980s standards), with 285,000 transistors,
                    ten times the number of the original 8086.4 The 386 has
                    eight logical units that are pipelined5 and operate mostly
                    autonomously.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The design process of the 386 is interesting because
                    it illustrates Intel's migration to automated design systems
                    and heavier use of simulation.23 At the time, Intel was
                    behind the industry in its use of tools so the leaders of
                    the 386 realized that more automation would be necessary to
                    build a complex chip like the 386 on schedule. By making a
                    large investment in automated tools, the 386 team completed
                    the design ahead of schedule. Along with proprietary CAD
                    tools, the team made heavy use of standard Unix tools such
                    as sed, awk, grep, and make to manage the various design
                    databases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Once the processor was released, the problems weren't
                    over.25 Some early 386 processors had a 32-bit multiply
                    problem, where some arguments would unpredictably produce
                    the wrong results under particular
                    temperature/voltage/frequency conditions. (This is unrelated
                    to the famous Pentium FDIV bug that cost Intel $475
                    million.) The root cause was a layout problem, not a logic
                    problem; they didn't allow enough margin to handle the worst
                    case data in combination with manufacturing process and
                    environment factors. This tricky problem didn't show up in
                    simulation or chip verification, but was only found in
                    stress testing.

                    The Space Age is leaving fingerprints on one of the most
                    remote parts of the planet—the stratosphere—which has
                    potential implications for climate, the ozone layer and the
                    continued habitability of Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using tools hitched to the nose cone of their research
                    planes and sampling more than 11 miles above the planet's
                    surface, researchers have discovered significant amounts of
                    metals in aerosols in the atmosphere, likely from
                    increasingly frequent launches and returns of spacecraft and
                    satellites. That mass of metal is changing atmospheric
                    chemistry in ways that may impact Earth's atmosphere and
                    ozone layer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are finding this human-made material in what we consider
                    a pristine area of the atmosphere," said Dan Cziczo, one of
                    a team of scientists who published a study on these results
                    in the
                    <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>. "And
                    if something is changing in the stratosphere—this stable
                    region of the atmosphere—that deserves a closer look."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cziczo, professor and head of the Department of Earth,
                    Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences in Purdue's College of
                    Science, is an expert in atmospheric science who has spent
                    decades studying this rarefied region.

                    Led by Dan Murphy, an adjunct professor in the Department of
                    Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences and a researcher
                    at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the
                    team detected more than 20 elements in ratios that mirror
                    those used in spacecraft alloys.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found that the mass of lithium, aluminum, copper and
                    lead from spacecraft reentry far exceeded those metals found
                    in natural cosmic dust. Nearly 10% of large sulfuric acid
                    particles—the particles that help protect and buffer the
                    ozone layer—contained aluminum and other spacecraft metals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists estimate that as many as 50,000 more satellites
                    may reach orbit by 2030. The team calculates that means
                    that, in the next few decades, up to half of stratospheric
                    sulfuric acid particles would contain metals from reentry.
                    What effect that could have on the atmosphere, the ozone
                    layer and life on Earth is yet to be understood.

                    literally can be heard, concludes a team of philosophers and
                    psychologists who used auditory illusions to reveal how
                    moments of silence distort people's perception of time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings address the debate of whether people can hear
                    more than sounds, which has puzzled philosophers for
                    centuries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We typically think of our sense of hearing as being
                    concerned with sounds. But silence, whatever it is, is not a
                    sound—it's the absence of sound," said lead author Rui Zhe
                    Goh, a Johns Hopkins University graduate student in
                    philosophy and psychology. "Surprisingly, what our work
                    suggests is that nothing is also something you can hear."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team adapted well-known auditory illusions to create
                    versions in which the sounds of the original illusions were
                    replaced by moments of silence. For example, one illusion
                    made a sound seem much longer than it really was. In the
                    team's new silence-based illusion, an equivalent moment of
                    silence also seemed longer than it really was.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fact that these silence-based illusions produced exactly
                    the same results as their sound-based counterparts suggests
                    that people hear silence just as they hear sounds, the
                    researchers said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "There's at least one thing that we hear that isn't a
                    sound, and that's the silence that happens when sounds go
                    away," said co-author Ian Phillips, a Bloomberg
                    Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Psychological and
                    Brain Sciences. "The kinds of illusions and effects that
                    look like they are unique to the auditory processing of a
                    sound, we also get them with silences, suggesting we really
                    do hear absences of sound too."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings establish a new way to study the perception of
                    absence, the team said.

                    A prominent cryptography expert has told New Scientist that
                    a US spy agency could be weakening a new generation of
                    algorithms designed to protect against hackers equipped with
                    quantum computers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <a href="https://cr.yp.to/djb.html">Daniel Bernstein</a> at
                    the University of Illinois Chicago says that the US National
                    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is deliberately
                    obscuring the level of involvement the US National Security
                    Agency (NSA) has in developing new encryption standards for
                    "post-quantum cryptography" (PQC). He also believes that
                    NIST has made errors – either accidental or deliberate – in
                    calculations describing the security of the new standards.
                    NIST denies the claims.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "NIST isn't following procedures designed to stop NSA from
                    weakening PQC," says Bernstein. "People choosing
                    cryptographic standards should be transparently and
                    verifiably following clear public rules so that we don't
                    need to worry about their motivations. NIST promised
                    transparency and then claimed it had shown all its work, but
                    that claim simply isn't true."

                    to standardise a new generation of algorithms that resist
                    their attacks. Bernstein, who
                    <a href="https://archive.ph/BHGOM"
                      >coined the term post-quantum cryptography</a
                    >
                    in 2003 to refer to these kinds of algorithms, says the NSA
                    is actively engaged in putting secret weaknesses into new
                    encryption standards that will allow them to be more easily
                    cracked with the right knowledge. NIST's standards are used
                    globally, so flaws could have a large impact.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bernstein alleges that NIST's calculations for one of the
                    upcoming PQC standards, Kyber512, are "glaringly wrong",
                    making it appear more secure than it really is. He says that
                    NIST multiplied two numbers together when it would have been
                    more correct to add them, resulting in an artificially high
                    assessment of Kyber512's robustness to attack.

                    Millions of Canadians grew accustomed to hearing a version
                    of this daily affirmation on CBC Radio One. The National
                    Research Council Time Signal, and the series of 800 Hz
                    "pips" that preceded and followed the time-setting dash,
                    worked its way into everyday rituals. Human listeners, and
                    automated radio receivers at railways, shipping firms, and
                    other entities, could set their mechanical clocks to it.
                    That is why it started broadcasting on November 5, 1939, the
                    same year as Canada's entry into World War II.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The long dash's last broadcast was,

                    Both the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the NRC have
                    cited accuracy as the reason the 84-year ritual was halted.

                    that because the CBC is now heard over satellite and
                    Internet connections, not just terrestrial radio, there are
                    delays when people hear it. A spokesperson acknowledged
                    Canadians' "fondness" for the daily ritual but said it "can
                    no longer ensure that the time announcement can be
                    accurate."

                    A strange mystic swings a pocket watch back and forth,
                    repeating the phrase "You're getting sleepy, very sleepy,"
                    giving them absolute command over their subject. That's not
                    how hypnotism really works, but it's the way it's often
                    depicted in pop culture. Even some clinicians and hypnosis
                    educators propagate harmful myths about hypnosis.

                      >Steven Jay Lynn</a
                    >, a professor of psychology at Binghamton University, State
                    University of New York, is an expert on hypnosis who has
                    made major contributions to the judicial system for his
                    insight on the practice. Lynn believes that hypnosis has
                    many useful clinical applications, but that myths keep it
                    from being utilized to its full potential.

                  <p>
                    A hypnotized person is believed to display "blind
                    obedience," going along automatically with whatever the
                    hypnotist suggests. [...]

                  <p><em>Hypnosis is a "special state"</em></p>
                  <p>
                    Hypnosis is often mischaracterized as a "special state" in
                    which defense mechanisms are reduced and a "unique state of
                    physical relaxation and conscious unconsciousness" allows us
                    to enter our subconscious depths through hypnosis. [...]

                  <p><em>People are either hypnotizable or they are not</em></p>
                  <p>
                    Responsiveness to hypnosis can be relatively stable over
                    time. Yet it is inaccurate to assume that people are either
                    hypnotizable or not. [...]

                    Suggested behaviors during hypnosis can seem so much a
                    departure from the mundane that questions inevitably arise
                    regarding whether hypnotic responses are genuine. However,
                    neuroimaging studies reveal that the effects of hypnotic
                    suggestions activate brain regions (e.g, visual processing)
                    consistent with suggested events (e.g., hallucinating an

                    recall extremely accurate memories from a distant past life
                    under hypnosis. But research suggests a contrary view.

                [<em>Paywalled-Subscribers Only</em>] describes how GPT tools
                can be used for some tasks but will reduce the quality of
                workers output in others in a phenomenon dubbed "falling asleep
                behind the wheel".
              </p>
              <p>
                Tasks where GPT assisted consultants did better: creative
                business idealization and selling concepts.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i
                  >Participants were required to complete 18 tasks, or as many
                  as they could within the given time frame, across four broad
                  domains: creativity (e.g. "propose at least 10 ideas for a new
                  shoe targeting an underserved market or sport"); analytical
                  thinking (e.g. "segment the footwear industry market based on
                  users"); writing proficiency (e.g. "draft a press release
                  marketing copy for your product"); and persuasiveness (e.g.
                  "pen an inspirational memo to employees detailing why your
                  product would outshine competitors").</i
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Tasks where relying too much on GPT tools reduced the output
                quality (but was faster): tasks where data analysis was required
                to draw the right conclusion
              </p>
              <p>

                  company insiders and financial data from a spreadsheet to

                    An advertising industry group urged Comcast to stop its
                    "10G" ads or modify them to state that 10G is an
                    "aspirational" technology rather than something the company
                    actually provides on its cable network today. The National
                    Advertising Division (NAD), part of the advertising
                    industry's self-regulatory system run by BBB National
                    Programs, ruled against Comcast after a challenge lodged by
                    T-Mobile.

                    >
                    Thursday, the NAD recommended that Comcast "discontinue its
                    '10G' claims" or "modify its advertising to (a) make clear
                    that it is implementing improvements that will enable it to
                    achieve '10G' and that it is aspirational or (b) use '10G'
                    in a manner that is not false or misleading, consistent with
                    this decision."<br />[...]<br />Comcast isn't alone in its
                    use of the 10G term, which was unveiled in January 2019 by

                    that 10G marketing was likely to confuse consumers and that
                    it indicated cable companies were envious of the 5G hype
                    generated by the wireless industry.

                    In this latest study, physicist Arianna Gleason of Stanford
                    University and colleagues bombarded thin slivers of water,
                    sandwiched between two diamond layers, with some

                    Successive shockwaves raised the pressure to 200 GPa (2

                    (8,500 °F) – hotter than the temperatures of the 2019

                    crystals were in fact a new phase distinct from superionic
                    ice observed in 2019. The newly discovered superionic ice,
                    Ice XIX, has a body-centered cubic structure and increased
                    conductivity compared to its predecessor from 2019, Ice

                    with your RTX 4090 again, another incident of GPU meltdown
                    pops up in the forums. Redditor Byogore reports that he
                    bought an Asus 4090 in Germany a year ago because of US
                    supply issues. The card worked totally fine until it

                    >
                    two days ago. This incident is unusual because typically
                    failures have happened much sooner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other Redditors quickly questioned whether Byogore had the
                    connectors seated securely since "user error" was one of
                    Nvidia's excuses when the issue

                    shortly after the RTX4090 launch. Byogore defended his
                    ability to properly attach a computer component.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The fact that the 90-degree cable mod adapter [to
                    prevent bending] was plugged in fully to the connector and
                    the connector still melted, then we know that we have a
                    problem with the card. We have a problem with the card. We
                    do not have a problem with the cable. It's not user error,
                    it's not a cable not plugged in properly problem, it's not a
                    cable mod problem, but it's a problem with the design and
                    the engineering of the card."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NorthridgeFix also points out that even if the problem was
                    caused by user error, it's still Nvidia's fault. For
                    instance, if a user is plugging in a cable as they do with
                    any other, past or present, and it leaves a 1mm gap that
                    causes failure, that is not the user's fault. When there is
                    a tolerance issue like that, it is the manufacturer's
                    responsibility to fix it or design a mechanism to prevent
                    it, not blame the user for not plugging it in correctly and
                    doing nothing more about it.

                    Byogore says that the meltdown happened while he was playing
                    Battlefield 2042. The screen turned black, but the audio
                    continued. Then, the computer rebooted itself. As it started
                    up, he could smell burnt plastic. The card still worked, but
                    only briefly before crashing and burning again. Byogore
                    mentioned that he has a 1,000W Corsair PSU and that the 4090
                    was undervolted at the time of the catastrophic failure.
                    However, he didn't note whether his PSU was ATX 3.0. The
                    problem only seems to occur on older ATX 2.0 power supplies.

                    4090's hot-button woes. It initially blamed users for not

                    The team found that fundamental frequency differences by sex
                    increased in larger groups and those with polygynous mating
                    systems, especially in groups with a higher female-to-male
                    ratio. They reported their findings today (July 10) in

                    [...] Deeper male voices may act as an additional way to
                    fend off mating competitors without having to engage in
                    costly fighting by making males sound bigger, in addition to
                    other physical traits like height and muscle size, according
                    to the researchers. In adult humans, for instance, males
                    vocalize at an average of 120 hertz whereas females vocalize
                    at an average of about 220 hertz, putting humans right in
                    the middle of polygynous societies, the researchers
                    reported.

                    "Although social monogamy is really common in humans, mating
                    and reproduction in our ancestors was substantially
                    polygynous," Puts said. "Our findings help us to understand
                    why male and female voices of our species differ so
                    drastically. It may be a product of our evolutionary
                    history, particularly our history of living in large groups
                    in which some males reproduced with multiple females."

                    [...] Among the biggest issues in machine learning is the
                    movement of data. The key data involved are the so-called
                    weights and activations that define the strength of the
                    connections between artificial neurons in one layer and the
                    information that those neurons will pass to the next layer.

                    prioritize this problem by keeping data as close as they can
                    to the processing elements. Researchers have been working on
                    multiple ways to do this, such as moving some of the
                    computing into the memory itself and

                    and the like). In that scheme, the weights are encoded as
                    conductance values in a resistive memory element (RRAM). The
                    RRAM is an integral part of an analog circuit that performs
                    the key machine learning calculation, multiply and
                    accumulate. That computation is done in analog as a simple
                    summation of currents, potentially saving huge amounts of
                    power.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    IBM’s Geoff Burr explained analog AI in depth in the
                    <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/analog-ai"
                      >December 2021 issue of IEEE Spectrum</a
                    >. At IEDM, he’ll be delivering a design for ways analog AI
                    can tackle transformer models.

                    Another interesting AI scheme coming up at IEDM originates
                    with researchers at Tsinghua University and Peking
                    University. It’s based on a three-layer system that includes
                    a silicon CMOS logic layer, a carbon nanotube transistor and
                    RRAM layer, and another layer of RRAM made from a different
                    material. This combination, they say, solves a data transfer
                    bottleneck in many schemes that seek to lower the power and
                    latency of AI by building computing in memory. In tests it
                    performed a standard image recognition task with the similar
                    accuracy to a GPU but almost 50 times faster and with about
                    1/40th the energy.

                    [...] Despite the increasing frequency and intensity of
                    disasters, it is possible to reduce risks to agriculture.

                    "There is no one size fits all solution," said the FAO's
                    Conforti, but "there are a range of practices that can
                    enhance the resilience of agricultural systems."

                  <p>
                    That includes agronomic techniques such as using different
                    plant varieties and different methods to prepare the soil,
                    as well as creating and improving warning systems.

                    When locusts invaded the Horn of Africa region in 2020 and
                    2021, early warning provided the time necessary to treat 2.3
                    million hectares (5.6 million acres) in the region and
                    nearby Yemen.

                    Some $1.77 billion in losses in grain and dairy production
                    was saved, the FAO estimates.

                  <p>
                    Moreover, it was extremely cost-effective, with each dollar
                    invested in prevention measures resulted in $15 of avoided
                    crop losses.

                    Recent research has revealed that nearly half a million
                    years ago, ancient human ancestors, predating
                    <em>Homo sapiens</em>, were already engaging in advanced
                    woodworking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The artifacts found indicate that these humans were building
                    structures, potentially laying the foundation of platforms
                    or parts of dwellings, much earlier than what was once
                    believed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A team from the
                    <a
                      href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-liverpool/"
                      >University of Liverpool</a
                    >
                    and Aberystwyth University excavated preserved wood at
                    Kalambo Falls, Zambia, dating back to an impressive 476,000
                    years. Analyzing the stone tool cut marks on the wood, the
                    team deduced that these early humans intentionally shaped
                    and combined two logs, showcasing the deliberate crafting of
                    logs to fit together. Prior to this discovery, humans were
                    believed to only utilize wood for simpler purposes such as
                    creating fire, crafting digging sticks, and making spears.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The preservation of this wood is in itself remarkable.
                    Typically, wood from such ancient times deteriorates and
                    disappears. However, at Kalambo Falls, high water levels
                    have protected and preserved these ancient wooden
                    structures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These findings cast doubt on the previously held belief that
                    Stone Age humans were strictly nomadic. The abundance of
                    resources in the vicinity of Kalambo Falls suggests that
                    these ancient humans could have settled, tapping into the
                    perennial water source and the surrounding forest for
                    sustenance, allowing them to engage in construction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Professor Larry Barham from the University of Liverpool
                    articulated the significance of this discovery, stating,
                    "They used their intelligence, imagination, and skills to
                    create something they'd never seen before, something that
                    had never previously existed."

                    Given the large development costs and ongoing subsidy, one
                    might start to question why Europe developed the Ariane 6 in
                    the first place. After all, the Ariane 5 has a good success
                    rate and, if it had not been retired earlier this year,
                    would be seeing significant demand on the launch market.
                    Instead, Europe has a gap in its ability to launch medium
                    and large satellites until the Ariane 6 is operationally
                    ready.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another significant downside to all of this is that Europe
                    spent a decade developing a rocket that is
                    <em>somewhat</em> more modern than the Ariane 5 but still
                    performs the same basic function at the same basic price.
                    During that lost decade, SpaceX has amply demonstrated the
                    value of re-flying first stages and has kickstarted a
                    stampede within the launch industry toward reuse. Because it
                    has been focused on the expendable Ariane 6, the European
                    Space Agency has missed out on this opportunity. It is now
                    years behind and only starting basic technology
                    demonstrations rather than bringing a true Falcon 9
                    competitor to market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "There is very little we can do now," Parsonson said.
                    "I know that. Ariane 6 is a pill that we're just going to
                    have to swallow. We cannot cancel the program and any new
                    development would take several years to mature. What we can
                    do, however, is make sure that ArianeGroup is not involved
                    in the future of European launch."

                    The European Space Agency's Euclid space telescope is back
                    to normal and will resume its mission, thanks to a software
                    update that was required after its navigation sensors
                    mistakenly identified solar ray signals as stars.

                    >
                    a month later, mission control discovered the telescope was
                    failing to focus on stars. Squiggly lines and circles
                    captured in another image revealed that Euclid was looping
                    around and struggling to lock onto distant stars to keep it
                    steady during its observations.

                  <p>
                    Mission control pinpointed the issue and realized the
                    telescope's Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS), which the craft uses
                    to locate a set of landmark stars to help navigate and align
                    its instruments on designated targets, was to blame. The
                    optical sensors were mistakenly identifying photons, ejected
                    by the Sun during periods of high solar activity, as stars.

                    The FGS analyzes light from distant sources and helps
                    control Euclid's orientation. Since it was misinterpreting
                    the solar rays as stars, the telescope was moving
                    haphazardly making it difficult to focus its sight. Working
                    together with aerospace companies Thales Alenia Space and
                    Leonardo, ESA engineers updated its software to change the
                    way its sensors characterize stars.

                    The patch was uploaded to Euclid, and the telescope is now
                    functioning normally. Mission control will continue testing
                    its performance for a little while longer before it
                    officially begins to collect data.

                    In August and September, threat actors unleashed the biggest
                    distributed denial-of-service attacks in Internet history by
                    exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in a key
                    technical protocol. Unlike other high-severity zerodays in
                    recent years—<a

                    indiscriminate exploits, the more recent attacks, dubbed
                    HTTP/2 Rapid Reset, were barely noticeable to all but a
                    select few engineers.

                  <p>
                    HTTP2/Rapid Reset is a novel technique for waging DDoS, or
                    distributed denial-of-service attacks, of an unprecedented
                    magnitude. It wasn’t discovered until after it was already
                    being exploited to deliver record-breaking DDoSes. One
                    attack on a customer using the Cloudflare content delivery
                    network peaked at 201 million requests per second, almost
                    triple the previous record Cloudflare had seen of
                    <a
                      href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-mitigates-record-breaking-71-million-request-per-second-ddos-attack/"
                      >71 million rps</a
                    >. An attack on a site using Google’s cloud infrastructure
                    topped out at 398 million rps, more than 7.5 times bigger
                    than the previous record Google recorded of 46 million rps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The vulnerability that HTTP/2 Rapid Reset exploits
                    resides in HTTP/2, which went into effect in 2015 and has
                    undergone several overhauls since then. Compared to the
                    HTTP/1 and HTTP/1.1 protocols that predated it, HTTP/2
                    provided the ability for a single HTTP request to carry 100
                    or more “streams” that a server can receive all at once. The
                    resulting throughput can lead to almost 100 times higher
                    utilization of each connection, compared with the earlier
                    HTTP protocols.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The increased efficiency wasn’t just useful for distributing
                    video, audio, and other sorts of benign content. DDoSers
                    began leveraging HTTP/2 to deliver attacks that were orders
                    of magnitude larger. There are two properties in the
                    protocol allowing for these new efficient DDoSes. Before
                    discussing them, it’s useful to review how DDoS attacks work
                    in general and then move on to the way HTTP protocols prior
                    to 2.0 worked.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The type of attack carried out by HTTP/2 Rapid Reset
                    falls into a third form of DDoS known as Application Layer
                    attacks. Rather than trying to overwhelm the incoming
                    connection (volumetric) or exhaust the routing
                    infrastructure (network protocol), application-level DDOSes
                    attempt to exhaust the computing resources available in
                    layer 7 of a target’s infrastructure. Floods to server
                    applications for HTTP, HTTPS, and SIP voice are among the
                    most common means for exhausting a target’s computing
                    resources.

                    Marks on the ribcage of a 48,000-year-old cave lion skeleton
                    suggest the animal was killed by Neanderthals, making it the
                    first evidence that our nearest human cousins hunted the Ice
                    Age predators.
                  </p>

                    A team of paleoanthropologists and archaeologists recently
                    scrutinized the remains of four lions: the aforementioned
                    skeleton, which was excavated in 1985 in Siegsdorf, Germany,
                    and phalanges and sesamoid bones from three lion specimens
                    excavated from Einhornhöle, Germany, in 2019. The former
                    showed evidence of being punctured by a wooden-tipped
                    spear—a known weapon of Neanderthals—and the latter three
                    had cut marks that suggested they were butchered in a way to
                    keep the animals' claws preserved on the fur. The team's
                    research is published today in Scientific Reports.

                    "The notion that Neanderthals interacted with cave lions
                    holds deep significance," said Gabriele Russo, a
                    paleoanthropologist at Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen
                    and the study's lead author, in an email to Gizmodo. "It
                    reveals that Neanderthals were actively engaged with their
                    environment, which included encounters with formidable
                    creatures like lions. These interactions encompassed not
                    only the cultural use of lion body parts but also the
                    ability to hunt them."

                    Cave lions (Panthera spelaea) are now extinct, but they
                    inhabited most of northern Eurasia during the Pleistocene,
                    recently enough that some preserved cave lions look like
                    they're just sleeping. They made up a remarkable tableau of
                    megafauna on the Ice Age steppe, alongside creatures like
                    the woolly rhinoceros, ancient, extinct elephant species,
                    and the woolly mammoth. And while the mammoth is a known
                    quarry of Neanderthals, it now appears that the human group
                    also hunted cave lions, one of the most prominent Ice Age
                    predators.

                    Speaking to partners last week as part of their annual Open
                    Innovation Platform forum in Europe, a big portion of TSMC's

                    nanosheet gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, backside power
                    delivery, and super-high-performance metal-insulator-metal
                    (SHPMIM) capacitor over the next few years. But in order to
                    take advantage of these innovations, TSMC warns, chip
                    designers will need to use all-new electronic design
                    automation (EDA), simulation, and verification tools as well
                    as IP. And while making such a big shift is never an easy
                    task, TSMC is bringing some good news to chip designers

                    the major EDA tools, verification tools, foundation IP, and
                    even analog IP for N2 are already available for use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Preparations for the start of N2 chip production,
                    scheduled for sometime in the second half of 2025, began
                    long ago. Nanosheet GAA transistors behave differently than
                    familiar FinFETs, so EDA and other tool and IP makers had to
                    build their products from scratch. This is where TSMC's Open
                    Innovation Platform (OIP) demonstrated its prowess and
                    enabled TSMC's partners to start working on their products
                    well in advance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By now, major EDA tools from Cadence and Synopsys as well as
                    many tools from Ansys and Siemens EDA have been certified by
                    TSMC, so chip developers can already use them to design
                    chips. Also, EDA software programs from Cadence and Synopsys
                    are ready for analog design migration. Furthermore,
                    Cadence's EDA tools already support N2P's backside power
                    delivery network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With pre-built IP designs, things are taking a bit longer.
                    TSMC's foundation libraries and IP, including standard
                    cells, GPIO/ESD, PLL, SRAM, and ROM are ready both for
                    mobile and high-performance computing applications.
                    Meanwhile, some PLLs exist in pre-silicon development kits,
                    whereas others are silicon proven. Finally, blocks such as
                    non-volatile memory, interface IP, and even chiplet IP are
                    not yet available - bottlenecking some chip designs - but
                    these blocks in active development or planned for
                    development by companies like Alphawave, Cadence, Credo,
                    eMemory, GUC, and Synopsys, according to a TSMC slide.
                    Ultimately, the ecosystem of tools and libraries for
                    designing 2 nm chips is coming together, but it's not all
                    there quite yet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Although many of the major building blocks for chips
                    are N2-ready, a lot of work still has to be done by many
                    companies before TSMC's 2 nm-class process technologies go
                    into mass production. Large companies, which tend to design
                    (or co-design) IP and development tools themselves are
                    already working on their 2 nm chips, and should be ready
                    with their products by the time mass production starts in 2H
                    2025. Other players can also fire up their design engines
                    because 2 nm preps are well underway at TSMC and its
                    partners.

                    Using "Protect the children!" as their rallying cry, red
                    states are enacting digital pornography restrictions.
                    Texas's effort, H.B. 1181, requires commercial pornographic
                    websites—and others, as we'll see shortly—to verify that
                    their users are adults, and to display state-drafted
                    warnings about pornography's alleged health dangers. In late
                    August, a federal district judge blocked the law from taking
                    effect. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
                    expedited Texas's appeal, and it just held oral argument.
                    This law, or one of the others like it, seems destined for
                    the Supreme Court.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So continues what the Washington Post, in the headline of a
                    1989 op-ed by the columnist Nat Henthoff, once called "<a
                      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1989/01/21/the-eternal-war-against-pornography/be7a041f-2ec8-41f5-a38e-4398bd8ff506/"

                  <p>
                    It's true that the First Amendment does not protect
                    obscenity—which the Supreme Court defines as "prurient" and
                    "patently offensive" material devoid of "serious literary,
                    artistic, political, or scientific value." Like many past
                    anti-porn crusaders, however, Texas's legislators blew past
                    those confines. H.B. 1181 targets material that is obscene
                    to <em>minors</em>. Because "virtually all salacious
                    material" is "prurient, offensive, and without value" to
                    young children, the district judge observed, H.B. 1181
                    covers "sex education [content] for high school seniors,"
                    "prurient R-rated movies," and much else besides. Texas's
                    attorneys claim that the state is going after "teen bondage
                    gangbang" films, but the law they're defending sweeps in
                    paintings like

                    We hear plenty of legitimate concerns regarding the new wave
                    of generative AI, from the human jobs it could replace to
                    its potential for creating misinformation. But one area that
                    often gets overlooked is the sheer amount of energy these
                    systems use. In the not-so-distant future, the technology
                    could be consuming the same amount of electricity as an
                    entire country.

                    De Vries notes that the training phase for large language
                    models is often considered the most energy-intensive, and
                    therefore has been the focus of sustainability research in
                    AI.

                  <p>
                    Following training, models are deployed into a production
                    environment and begin the inference phase. In the case of
                    ChatGPT, this involves generating live responses to user
                    queries. Little research has gone into the inference phase,
                    but De Vries believes there are indications that this period
                    might contribute significantly to an AI model's life-cycle
                    costs.

                  <p>
                    According to research firm SemiAnalysis, OpenAI required
                    3,617 Nvidia HGX A100 servers, with a total of 28,936 GPUs,
                    to support ChatGPT, implying an energy demand of 564 MWh per
                    day. For comparison, an estimated 1,287 MWh was used in
                    GPT-3's training phase, so the inference phase's energy
                    demands were considerably higher.

                  <p>
                    Google, which reported that 60% of AI-related energy
                    consumption from 2019 to 2021 stemmed from inference, is
                    integrating AI features into its search engine. Back in

                    [...] "It would be advisable for developers not only to
                    focus on optimizing AI, but also to critically consider the
                    necessity of using AI in the first place, as it is unlikely
                    that all applications will benefit from AI or that the
                    benefits will always outweigh the costs," said De Vries.

                    Regular salt looks like a fine white powder. Sure, it tastes
                    good, but it's not very interesting to look at.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But what if I told you that you could transform the salt
                    sitting in your kitchen into a work of art?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What if I told you that within a few hours, you could turn
                    white, powdery salt into premium salt crystals shaped like
                    pyramids, flowers and Eiffel towers?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Plus, you don't need to be good at art. You don't need to
                    carve those pyramids yourself. Just sit beside the stove,
                    and watch as pyramid salt crystals grow from a dish of salt
                    water right before your eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me show you how to do just that.</p>
                  <p>
                    To my knowledge, it's the only such guide on the Internet.
