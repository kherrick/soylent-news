                    Inspired by the footpads of desert-traversing camels,
                    Bridgestone's first-generation lunar rover tire integrated a
                    soft, metal-based felt material into the tread area to
                    enhance traction on the moon's regolith surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Building on this foundation, the second-generation tire
                    introduces a robust skeletal structure, incorporating thin
                    metal spokes and segmented tread design. These advancements,
                    facilitated by structural simulations and digital
                    technologies, are designed for durability and traction in
                    the harsh lunar environment – characterized by rocks, sand,
                    vacuum conditions and temperature fluctuations.

                I'm not sure what camels have to do with anything except hype,
                but it would be interesting to hear how they manufacture
                "metal-based felt".

                Like the Tweel, these use plastic spokes and rubber tread

                Airless tires are nothing new, they existed before pneumatic
                tires. Looking at the pics in this short history, it's easy to
                see why they never went into large production -- complex and
                heavy -- but plenty of inventors tried,

                  <p>
                    It's been twelve years since the big SOPA (Stop Online
                    Piracy Act) /PIPA (Protect IP Act) fight. I've been talking
                    with a few folks lately about how it feels like many people
                    have either forgotten that story or weren't paying attention
                    when it happened. Two years ago, we did a 10-year
                    retrospective on the fight, and it feels like some people
                    need a refresher. Most notably, Charles Rivkin, the head of
                    the MPA (formerly the MPAA), certainly appears to need a
                    refresher because he just announced it's time to bring back
                    SOPA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the young ones in the audience, SOPA (and its Senate
                    companion, PIPA) were bills pushed strongly by the film
                    (MPA) and recording (RIAA) industries. They were pushing for
                    "site blocking" for websites that the industries accused of
                    being "dedicated to piracy." The law was a slam dunk. It had
                    a huge number of co-sponsors, and the MPA/RIAA combo had
                    convinced Congress to pass ever more expansive copyright
                    laws basically every two to three years for the past 25
                    years. SOPA was set to become law.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Until it wasn't. Because the public spoke up loudly. I
                    (coincidentally) was at the Capitol on the day of the big
                    Internet Blackout in protest of SOPA/PIPA, and I heard the
                    phones ringing off the hook. I was running up and down the
                    halls of the office buildings, having Reps. tell me how they
                    were removing their names from the co-sponsor list. The
                    public spoke up and it worked.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it's important to remember why it worked: because the
                    law was a horrific attack on free speech and the open web.
                    And for no good reason.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We spent much time explaining why this would be a clear
                    violation of the First Amendment. Under the First Amendment,
                    you cannot shut down an entire publishing house just because
                    it sometimes has published works that contain, say,
                    defamation. You cannot ban access to a photocopying machine
                    because some users use it to infringe. SOPA was basically
                    built-in prior restraint.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can only target the actually violative content and not
                    declare entire sites be blocked. That goes way beyond what
                    the First Amendment allows.

                    [...] To provide directional information from a stationary
                    device without getting too close, researchers use an array
                    of detector grids along with another grid called a mask,
                    which imprints a pattern on the array that differs depending
                    on the direction of the source. An algorithm interprets the
                    different timings and intensities of signals received by
                    each separate detector or pixel. This often leads to a
                    complex design of detectors.

                    Typical detector arrays for sensing the direction of
                    radiation sources are large and expensive and include at
                    least 100 pixels in a 10 by 10 array. However, the group
                    found that using as few as four pixels arranged in the
                    tetromino shapes of the figures in the "Tetris" game can
                    come close to matching the accuracy of the large, expensive
                    systems.

                  <p>
                    The key is a proper computerized reconstruction of the
                    angles of arrival of the rays, based on the times each
                    sensor detects the signal and the relative intensity each
                    one detects, as reconstructed through an AI-guided study of
                    simulated systems.

                    Of the different configurations of four pixels, the
                    researchers tried—square, S-, J- or T-shaped—they found
                    through repeated experiments that the S-shaped array
                    provided the most precise results. This array gave
                    directional readings that were accurate to within about 1
                    degree, but all three of the irregular shapes performed
                    better than the square. This approach, Li says, "was
                    literally inspired by Tetris."

                    a real cesium radiation source, led by Vavrek, where the
                    researchers at MIT did not know the ground-truth source
                    location, a test device was performed with high accuracy in
                    finding the direction and distance to the source.

                    Intel's current-gen Meteor Lake chips only provide 10 TOPS
                    of performance from the NPU, falling below the bar for
                    next-gen AI PCs. Lunar Lake's 45 TOPS from the NPU meets
                    that bar exactly. Gelsinger didn't elaborate on how much of
                    the remaining 55+ TOPS comes from the CPU and GPU, but it's
                    reasonable to expect in the range of 50 TOPS from the GPU
                    and 5 to 10 FLOPS from the CPU cores.

                    AMD's current-gen Ryzen Hawk Point platform has an NPU with

                    AMD wouldn't elaborate further and break out the amount of

                    AMD's Strix Point NPU at 48 TOPS if NPU performance triples.

                a violation of our basic human rights. Specifically holding
                global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, in line
                with the goals of the Paris climate agreement, is a necessary

                health, well-being, and quality of life which come with the

                    Peregrine falcon populations across North America are
                    heavily contaminated with harmful flame retardants–including
                    those that have been phased out for years—according to a new
                    study
                    <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c10907"

                  <p>
                    Flame retardants are chemicals added to furniture,
                    electronics, and other everyday products to meet
                    flammability standards, though they often do not work as
                    intended. They also migrate out of products they are added
                    to and end up in wildlife and people and many are linked to
                    serious health and environmental harms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our results expose the long-term consequences of adding
                    flame retardants to consumer products," said senior author
                    Da Chen, a scientist at Jinan University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "As globally distributed apex predators, the peregrine
                    falcon is the ideal canary in the coal mine for monitoring
                    flame retardant pollution in the environment. Flame
                    retardants phased out a decade ago are still accumulating in
                    these birds and into their eggs, which indicates that the
                    threats of these chemicals to wildlife and people can far
                    outlast their production."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Continued exposure to old flame retardants comes from
                    the release of these chemicals from in-use and discarded
                    products produced before the phase-outs. Further, many flame
                    retardants released from products accumulate up marine and
                    terrestrial food chains over time, making apex predators
                    like peregrine falcons more likely to build up high
                    concentrations in their tissues. The flame retardants also
                    end up in their eggs through maternal transfer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Concentrations of the unregulated halogenated flame
                    retardants measured by the research team stayed constant or
                    declined throughout the study period, suggesting that
                    non-halogenated flame retardants and polymeric flame
                    retardants are more popular as replacements. Unfortunately,
                    those too are increasingly linked to human and wildlife
                    health harms.

                While what appears to be the real name of "Voltage" appears in
                the BBC story, your AC submitter thought it wise to redact that
                name (although I think there is a high chance that it is an
                alias).

                    New findings by Johns Hopkins University engineers working
                    with a high-tech simulation of schooling mackerel, offer
                    insight into why fish swim in schools and promise for the
                    design and operation of much quieter submarines and
                    autonomous undersea vehicles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's widely known that swimming in groups provides fish
                    with added protection from predators, but we questioned
                    whether it also contributes to reducing their noise," said
                    senior author Rajat Mittal. "Our results suggest that the
                    substantial decrease in their acoustic signature when
                    swimming in groups, compared to solo swimming, may indeed be
                    another factor driving the formation of fish schools."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The work is

                  <p>
                    The team created a 3D model based on the common mackerel to
                    simulate different numbers of fish swimming, changing up
                    their formations, how close they swam to one another, and
                    the degrees to which their movements synched. The model,
                    which applies to many fish species, simulates one to nine
                    mackerel being propelled forward by their tail fins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team found that a school of fish moving together in just
                    the right way was stunningly effective at noise reduction: A
                    school of seven fish sounded like a single fish.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "A predator, such as a shark, may perceive it as hearing a
                    lone fish instead of a group," Mittal said. "This could have
                    significant implications for prey fish."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The single biggest key to sound reduction, the team found,
                    was the synchronization of the school's tail flapping—or
                    actually the lack thereof.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If fish moved in unison, flapping their tail fins at the
                    same time, the sound added up and there was no reduction in
                    total sound. But if they alternated tail flaps, the fish
                    canceled out each other's sound, the researchers found.

                    Tesla has settled an outstanding Autopilot fatality lawsuit
                    before the case could end up before a jury, but on the
                    condition that the settlement amount never sees the light of

                  <p>
                    According to Tesla lawyer Thomas Branigan, the settlement
                    amount could be perceived "as evidence of Tesla's potential
                    liability for losses, which may have a chilling effect on
                    settlement opportunity in subsequent cases." Branigan said
                    Tesla would suffer serious injury if the settlement amount
                    was not withheld, and his motion appears to have been
                    granted based on court documents.

                    There's plenty of unknowns in a situation like this, in
                    which Tesla chose to settle the matter a mere day before
                    jury selection was set to begin. Nonetheless, it's the first
                    settlement in an Autopilot-related case for Tesla, which so
                    far has prevailed in court on both cases that went before a
                    jury.

                    A leading gravitational wave observatory recently detected
                    ripples in spacetime that scientists say came from the
                    collision of a dead, superdense stellar remnant and an
                    unknown object.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The stellar remnant is what’s called a neutron star; it’s
                    what is left when a massive star collapses, leaving only a
                    dense core behind. Neutron stars are some of the densest
                    objects in the universe, with intense gravitational
                    fields—but not as intense as black holes, whose gravity is
                    so strong that not even light can escape their event
                    horizons.

                    [...] LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detected a gravitational wave signal
                    in May 2023, just days after the

                    following some upgrades that reduced the amount of noise in
                    the detector, improving its sensitivity to the subtle
                    perturbations of spacetime.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The unique gravitational wave signal travelled 650 million
                    light-years to get to the LIGO Livingston Observatory in
                    Louisiana. Researchers determined the signal came from the
                    merger of two objects. One of the objects was between 1.2
                    and 2 times the mass of our Sun, and the other was about 2.5
                    to 4.5 solar masses. The signal is dubbed GW230529_181500,
                    or GW230529 for short.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The smaller object, the astrophysicists concluded, is
                    probably a neutron star. But the larger object is more
                    massive than any known neutron star, indicating that it may
                    be an itsy-bitsy black hole. Their paper describing the
                    signal and its likely origins is
                    <a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/P2300352/public/"

                    on the LIGO website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The unknown object occupies the apparent mass gap that
                    exists between the heaviest known neutron star and the
                    lightest black hole. Further scrutiny of the collision will
                    indicate whether the unknown object is a low-mass black
                    hole, as the team suspects, or something else.

                    [...] There are still 80 significant signal candidates that
                    the team needs to sift through. So there are heady days

                    In most cases (68 percent), organizations don't deem the
                    incidents significant enough to report to anyone. Other
                    excuses included not knowing where to report incidents (13
                    percent of businesses), thinking a report would make no
                    difference (9 percent), and incidents being too recent to
                    allow time to report (4 percent).

                  <p>
                    As for the action taken, as many as 39 percent of businesses
                    took no action following their most disruptive breach in the
                    previous 12 months. Most defaulted to delivering more
                    training to staff (23 percent), with a much smaller

                    Small and micro businesses appear to be pulling the figures
                    down considerably. Overall, 59 percent of businesses enacted
                    some sort of organizational change following a breach, but
                    medium and large businesses were much more likely to take
                    action, with 74 and 86 percent of each respectively doing
                    something to prevent further intrusions.

                    Breaches that resulted in material outcomes for victims,
                    such as the theft of data, led to slightly different
                    results. A greater diversity of measures were enacted by
                    businesses and charities in this case, such as introducing
                    new security tools, but still, 18 percent of businesses did
                    absolutely nothing in response, even after a material
                    breach.

                    "In the event of a breach, businesses are not keeping
                    records, not informing the police or regulators, not
                    assessing the scale and impact of the incident," said Kays.

                  <p>
                    "They are failing to do the bare minimum. It's also
                    important to note that businesses are doing very little to
                    prevent or detect breaches in the first place."

                    awareness of security initiatives and willingness to seek
                    support.

                The invasive cannonball jellyfish is filling fishermen's nets,
                in a surge the environment ministry attributes to warming waters
                from climate change and a decline in jellyfish predators such as
                sharks and sea turtles.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, "sardines and other species that serve as
                fishing bait have disappeared. Fishing is at its lowest level in
                years," said Gustavo Carrasquel, of the NGO Azul Ambientalistas,
                who lives in Choroni, a town neighboring Chuao.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] Globally, jellyfish populations have soared. Researchers
                have warned of a tipping point in which the oceans could go from
                being dominated by fish populations, to jellyfish -- mostly as a
                result of overfishing.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] In Chuao, fishermen who would bring in between 3,000 and
                5,000 kilograms a week have seen their yields drop to between
                500 and 1,000 kilograms, said Douglas Martinez, 44, a fisherman.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mayora said that Venezuela should draw inspiration from
                countries such as Mexico, which exploits jellyfish commercially,
                exporting it to Asian countries where it is used in gastronomy
                or the pharmaceutical industry.

                    OEM Sales, likely sent this notification to direct business
                    partners. However, it's certainly just as important for
                    consumers moving into 2024. Higher-than-expected demand
                    combined with supply constraints have pushed us out of the
                    era of dirt-cheap storage now, as was rumored last fall.
                    Hopefully, the increased prices won't last too long.

                    TW's sources point toward HDD pricing increasing by as much
                    as 10%, with a minimum 5% pricing increase expected. There
                    are no hard numbers for NAND flash pricing, but NAND prices
                    were already heading up and we expect further pricing
                    increases could be in line with HDDs, if not worse.

                    Dolphins and whales use sound to communicate, navigate and
                    hunt. New research suggests that the collections of fatty
                    tissue that enable toothed whales to do so may have evolved
                    from their skull muscles and bone marrow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists at Hokkaido University determined DNA sequences
                    of genes which were expressed in acoustic fat
                    bodies—collections of fat around the head that toothed
                    whales use for echolocation. They measured gene expression
                    in the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) and Pacific
                    white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens). Their
                    findings were published in the journal Gene.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The evolution of acoustic fat bodies in the head—the melon
                    in the whale forehead, extramandibular fat bodies (EMFB)
                    alongside the jawbone, and intramandibular fat bodies (IMFB)
                    within the jawbone—was essential for sound use such as
                    echolocation. However, little is known about the genetic
                    origins of those fatty tissues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Toothed whales have undergone significant degenerations and
                    adaptations to their aquatic lifestyle," said Hayate
                    Takeuchi, a Ph.D. student at Hokkaido University's Hayakawa
                    Lab and first author of the study. One adaptation was the
                    partial loss of their sense of smell and taste, along with
                    the gain of echolocation to enable them to navigate in the
                    underwater environment.<br />...<br />"This study has
                    revealed that the evolutionary tradeoff of masticatory
                    muscles for the EMFB—between auditory and feeding
                    ecology—was crucial in the aquatic adaptation of toothed
                    whales," said Assistant Professor Takashi Hayakawa of the
                    Faculty of Environmental Earth Science, who led the study.

                  <p>
                    "It was part of the evolutionary shift away from chewing to
                    simply swallowing food, which meant the chewing muscles were
                    no longer needed."

                    Canadian telecom Bell Canada has been pushing its
                    cloud-based DVR service to its Fibe TV subscribers for
                    years. While it has given customers advantages, like the
                    ability to view their recordings from more devices, such as
                    phones, compared to using local DVR storage, users don't
                    have as much control over the recordings as they thought
                    they had.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On May 1, Fibe TV will automatically delete recordings
                    stored on its Cloud PVR (personal video recorder) offering
                    once the recordings hit 61 days of age, as confirmed by
                    Canadian online newspaper Daily Hive. Currently, customers
                    maintain access to recordings stored via Cloud PVR for 365
                    days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A Bell Canada spokesperson, Jacqueline Michelis,
                    minimized the idea of disruption to customers, telling Daily
                    Hive: "The viewing of nearly all recordings takes place
                    within 60 days, so there is minimal impact to customers."
                    Michelis didn't provide more details on how Bell Canada
                    arrived at this conclusion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Customers have turned to Bell Canada's online support
                    forum to share their discontent with the changes, with some
                    saying that they don't align with the services they expected
                    to receive when signing up for Fibe TV. Thankfully, Bell
                    Canada won't be able to delete recordings stored on DVR
                    hardware inside customers' homes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other complaints are coming from users whose recordings are
                    being deleted even when they haven't come close to maxing
                    out their cloud storage or if their recordings aren't
                    available on demand.

                    This all happened within 60 to 90 seconds. Similar results
                    were seen with cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) when the
                    tip of one antenna was severed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In both species of insects, after the hemolymph retracted, a
                    clot began to form. The scab from this clot became so tough
                    in cockroaches that even a tungsten needle could not
                    penetrate it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] How fast can hemocytes start assembling? The team went
                    back and observed viscous but not hardened hemolymph oozing
                    from wounds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While bleeding stopped by around a minute, hemocytes started
                    to form a scab around three minutes after the formation of
                    the last drop, which retracted after turning into a
                    viscoelastic fluid with polymers strong enough to thicken it
                    and hold it back. Some hemocytes would form pseudopodia
                    (much like amoebas do), which then attached to other
                    hemocytes. The aggregates that resulted made the fluid more
                    and more viscous and eventually formed a scab.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    Once upon a time, 60 years ago, IBM (International Business
                    Machines) presented a computer architecture that was
                    revolutionary at the time: the IBM System/360. The IBM
                    System/360 was officially unveiled on April 7, 1964, when
                    modern PCs and server technology for supercomputers were
                    still unthinkable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Decades before Windows, 3.5-inch hard disks, CDs or SSDs,
                    IBM had been developing a computer architecture since 1961
                    that the company referred to as the "5 billion dollar
                    gamble". An investment that would either secure IBM's future
                    or destroy the company's specialized computer business. At
                    that time, IBM was producing computers specifically for one
                    application (to put it simply). Upgrades were expensive and
                    required lots of resources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the bet paid off and IBM's System/360 became a success
                    with what are now absurdly puny performance figures by
                    today's standards. The RAM? From 8 KByte as the minimum up
                    to a luxurious 524 KByte as the maximum. This was actually a
                    lot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To put this into perspective: the Atari 2600 console, which
                    appeared over a decade later, had just 128 bytes of RAM.
                    Yes, that's right, 128 characters for the RAM. It wasn't
                    until a few years later that so-called "superchips" in the
                    cartridges made it possible to multiply the RAM. And even
                    then, 20 years later, the basic configuration did not even
                    come close to IBM's System/360.

                    ULA’s Delta IV Heavy rocket is the last of the Delta family
                    of medium-to-heavy launch vehicles. The Delta legacy dates
                    back to the Cold War, with the first Delta rocket launched
                    on May 13, 1960, from SLC-17 at Cape Canaveral as part of a
                    program developed by the U.S. government to build a suite of
                    expendable launch vehicles to carry payloads ranging from
                    satellites to deep space missions. The rocket family has had
                    388 launches spanning across six decades, evolving over time
                    to become bigger and more advanced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After the Delta chapter comes to a close, ULA’s new Vulcan
                    Centaur rocket is designed to take over. The
                    two-stage-to-orbit, expendable, heavy-lift launch vehicle
                    made its debut in January,

                    [...] "Agricultural diversification has been accused of
                    perhaps being good for biodiversity, but having a few
                    negative aspects too—especially with regards to not being
                    able to achieve sufficiently high yields. But what we
                    actually see, is that there is no reduction in yield from
                    diversified agriculture—not even when we include data from
                    large-scale European agriculture," says Grass.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In fact, the figures demonstrate that in the case of small
                    farms and farms with lots of cultivated land in the
                    surroundings, more diversified agriculture can significantly
                    promote food security. This, according to the researchers,
                    could be due to a number of factors.

                    "One example is fruit trees planted in maize fields in
                    Malawi, which can help farming families improve their food
                    security through improved diet and nutrition. Partly because
                    they eat the fruits themselves, and also because the trees
                    generate extra income when their fruits are sold at
                    market—income that provides small-scale farmers with
                    purchasing power for other foods," says Rasmussen.

                    Engineers have determined why NASA's Voyager 1 probe has

                    down to ground controllers on November 14. For nearly four
                    months, NASA knew Voyager 1 was still alive—it continued to
                    broadcast a steady signal—but could not decipher anything it
                    was saying.

                    Confirming their hypothesis, engineers at NASA's Jet
                    Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California confirmed a small
                    portion of corrupted memory caused the problem. The faulty
                    memory bank is located in Voyager 1's Flight Data System
                    (FDS), one of three computers on the spacecraft. The FDS
                    operates alongside a command-and-control central computer
                    and another device overseeing attitude control and pointing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Flight Data Subsystem was an innovation in
                    computing when it was developed five decades ago. It was the
                    first computer on a spacecraft to use volatile memory. Most
                    of NASA's missions operate with redundancy, so each Voyager
                    spacecraft launched with two FDS computers. But the backup
                    FDS on Voyager 1 failed in 1982.

                  <p>
                    Due to the Voyagers' age, engineers had to reference paper
                    documents, memos, and blueprints to help understand the
                    spacecraft's design details. After months of brainstorming

                    storing part of the affected portion of the FDS memory isn’t

                    what caused the issue. Two possibilities are that the chip
                    could have been hit by an energetic particle from space or
                    that it simply may have worn out after 46 years."

                    Voyager 1's distance from Earth complicates the
                    troubleshooting effort. The one-way travel time for a radio
                    signal to reach Voyager 1 from Earth is about 22.5 hours,
                    meaning it takes roughly 45 hours for engineers on the
                    ground to learn how the spacecraft responded to their
                    commands.

                    optimistic they can find a way for the FDS to operate
                    normally without the unusable memory hardware, which would
                    enable Voyager 1 to begin returning science and engineering
                    data again," NASA said.

                    Where is the line between life and death? For centuries, it
                    was pretty clear. You stopped breathing, your heart stopped
                    beating, your brain shut down, it was off to the morgue.
                    Well, now the science is showing that the demarcation line
                    for crossing the River Styx may not be quite so clear cut.

                    class of vulnerabilities within numerous HTTP/2 protocol
                    implementations. In many cases, it poses a more severe
                    threat compared to the Rapid Reset: a single machine (and in
                    certain instances, a mere single TCP connection or a handful
                    of frames) has the potential to disrupt server availability,
                    with consequences ranging from server crashes to substantial
                    performance degradation. Remarkably, requests that
                    constitute an attack are not visible in HTTP access logs. A

                The total eclipse will begin on Monday April 8 in North America
                in about two hours from when this story posts. Millions of
                people live in the path of totality and it will pass over some
                major metropolitan cities. Possible topics could be:<br />+ Were
                you in the path of totality?<br />+ Did you have to travel to
                get there?<br />+ Was it clear (in my area the forecast is for
                "partly sunny"--not too promising).<br />+ Your observations of
                the event itself -- personal, professional, previous solar
                eclipses you have witnessed, etc.

                    [...] To test the device, Huang and colleagues used it to
                    measure the tiny variations in the force of gravity caused
                    by the apparent motion of the Sun and the Moon, the same
                    variations that cause the tides. After setting up their
                    device in a vacuum chamber, they waited several weeks for
                    conditions inside the device to stabilize before conducting
                    continuous measurements for five days. Their signal
                    displayed a series of oscillations representing variations
                    in the local gravitational acceleration of up to about 10−7
                    of the standard value (g, approximately 10 m/s2). The
                    results show a close correspondence between the predicted
                    gravitational variations and the experimental data. Overall,
                    says Huang, the gravimeter demonstrated a sensitivity
                    roughly 3 times better than small solid-state gravimeters,
                    with much higher stability.

                    The scourge of software supply chain attacks—an increasingly
                    common hacking technique that hides malicious code in a
                    widely used legitimate program—can take many forms. Hackers
                    can penetrate an update server to seed out their malware, or
                    even break into the network where the software was developed
                    to corrupt it at the source. Or, in the case of one
                    particularly insidious software supply chain attacker known
                    as Jia Tan, they can spend two years politely and
                    enthusiastically volunteering to help.

                    Over the weekend, the cybersecurity and open source software
                    community was shocked by the news that a relatively new,
                    experimental version of XZ Utils—a compression utility
                    integrated into many popular distributions of
                    Linux—contained a backdoor that would have allowed hackers
                    in possession of a specific private key to connect to the
                    backdoored system and run their own commands as an
                    administrator. Only some chance detective work carried out
                    by a lone Microsoft engineer, Andres Freund—who'd detected a
                    strange delay in how the remote connection protocol SSH was
                    running in a version of the Linux variant Debian—caught the
                    spy trick before it ended up in many millions of systems
                    worldwide.

                    Hail is a semi-frequent visitor to winter, and occasionally
                    summer, seasons across the globe and tends to pass by in a
                    short but sharp downpour that can often be overlooked.
                    However, sometimes these meteorological phenomena are hard
                    to ignore. This was the case on 30 August 2022, when Gerona,
                    north-eastern Spain, experienced a severe event in which
                    individual hailstones reached a massive 12cm—the largest
                    ever documented in the country. This led to serious damage
                    to buildings, cars and agricultural areas, as well as 67
                    injuries and one fatality.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Untangling the cause of this unusually extreme hail event is

                    published in <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i>. Professor
                    Maria Luisa Martin, of Universidad de Valladolid, Spain, and
                    colleagues investigated the role a record-breaking marine
                    heat wave had in exacerbating the hail storm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Iberian Peninsula experienced a sea surface temperature
                    increase of an average 3.27°C protracted over six weeks in
                    the summer of 2022, the highest on record. The research team
                    found that atmospheric convective energy reached
                    unprecedented levels, thus alongside moisture from a warm
                    ocean, enhanced supercell (storms with vertical rotation of
                    rising air currents) development in the Pyrenees, leading to
                    the meteorological phenomenon of hail.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To explore this further, the scientists used a dataset of
                    &gt;280 documented supercells from 2011 to 2022 (with 57
                    citing large hailstones &gt;5cm diameter, and four giant
                    hailstone events where they exceed 10cm diameter) to
                    simulate the hail event both with and without the influence
                    of a marine heat wave in the Mediterranean Sea. Increased
                    sea surface temperature is known to be one of many
                    consequences of global warming, and it has a direct impact
                    on the frequency and intensity of prolonged (&gt;5 days)
                    heat wave events.

                    [...] This research is important as it is a cautionary tale
                    of how continued climate change will not only increase the
                    likelihood of marine heat waves, but also other elements of
                    Earth's interconnected cycles. Consequently, there may be
                    more unforeseen meteorological events to come, with alarming
                    environmental, social and economic impacts.

                    [...] The macaques that roam Lopburi are a symbol of local
                    culture, and a major tourist draw. But after years of
                    dangerous encounters with residents and visitors and several
                    failed attempts to bring peace with population controls,
                    local people and businesses have had enough.

                  <p>
                    The monkeys frequently try to snatch food from humans,
                    sometimes resulting in tussles that can leave people with
                    scratches and other injuries. But outrage grew in March when
                    a woman dislocated her knee after a monkey pulled her off
                    her feet in an effort to grab food, and another man was
                    knocked off a motorcycle by a hungry monkey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Authorities hope to round up some 2,500 urban monkeys and
                    place them in massive enclosures, said Athapol
                    Charoenshunsa, the director-general of the Department of
                    National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation. They'll
                    work with wildlife experts to find a way for a limited
                    number of monkeys to stay at liberty in the city, he added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Previous control measure have fallen short. From
                    2014-2023, the wildlife authorities neutered about 2,600
                    Lopburi monkeys.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Athapol said they are also working in other areas of
                    Thailand that are facing problems with monkeys, such as
                    Prajuab Kiri Khan and Phetchaburi. He said 52 of the
                    country's 77 provinces report frequent problems from
                    monkeys.

                Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of
                Alberta (U of A) in Canada have examined whether attaching a
                condor-inspired winglet to a wind turbine blade can also reduce
                drag and increase energy production.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Wind turbine blades use aerodynamics to extract the wind's
                    energy, which is converted to electricity. But ensuring that
                    they produce as much energy as possible is necessary if
                    we're to rely on clean, sustainable energy production.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What commonly reduces the efficiency of wind turbines is
                    induced drag, created as a result of lift. As a blade passes
                    through the air, an area of lower air pressure is formed on
                    top of it (the suction side). Higher-pressure air below the
                    blade (the pressure side) seeks equilibrium with the
                    lower-pressure area above, resulting in tip vortices, air
                    that trails off the blade tips in spirals. The vortices
                    deflect airflow downward (downwash), creating induced drag.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While most modern airplanes reduce induced drag by using
                    winglets to minimize the effect of tip vortices, their use
                    in the wind industry is still in its infancy. Studies into
                    wind turbines with winglets have noted a boost in power
                    production but often at the cost of extending the blade tip,
                    making it difficult to ascertain whether the improvement is
                    directly attributable to the winglet or an increase in the
                    blade's wetted area, the area in contact with external
                    airflow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To clarify the issue, the U of A researchers turned to
                    <a href="https://www.biome-renewables.com/"
                      >Biome Renewables</a
                    >, a Canadian industrial design firm that creates clean
                    energy products by
                    <a
                      href="https://newatlas.com/robotics/natural-robotics-contest/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;itm_medium=article-body"

                    >
                    and has designed winglets based on condor wings. Biome
                    developed its bio-inspired winglet for 'Project Condor.'
                    It's 17.6 ft (5.35 m) long and designed to be retrofitted to
                    a wind turbine's blade wingtip after production.[...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found that adding the winglet increased the pressure
                    difference between the suction surface and pressure surface
                    along the blade's span, which in turn increased the
                    turbine's torque (rotational force around an axis) and power
                    production. The average increase in energy production was
                    10%, which the researchers concluded was attributable to the
                    aerodynamic changes caused by the winglet and not just an
                    increase in the blade's swept area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To sum up, the results of the wake study and the power
                    production suggest that this bio-inspired design can
                    increase the power output of the wind turbines," said the
                    researchers.

                    The US and UK have agreed to work together to develop common
                    testing approaches for AI models, with safety being a key
                    focus.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The signed memorandum of understanding will see the AI
                    safety institutes of the US and the UK work “seamlessly”
                    with each other on research, safety evaluations and guidance
                    for AI safety. The institutes will cooperate and share
                    information to develop shared capabilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The US Department of Commerce said both countries will align
                    their scientific approaches and create robust suites of
                    evaluations for AI models, in order to deal with the risks
                    associated with this technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The two safety institutes plan to perform at least one joint
                    testing exercise on a publicly accessible model, as part of
                    their plans to make a common approach to AI safety testing.
                    These institutes also plan to combine their expertise by
                    exchanging personnel between the two organisations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new agreement follows commitments made by the two

                    agreement was signed by US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo
                    and UK technology secretary Michelle Donelan.

                    Japan's Space Exploration Agency (JAXA) late last week
                    revealed that its Moon lander had – somewhat unexpectedly –
                    mostly survived a second lunar night and was briefly well
                    enough to send home some snaps.

                    The Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM)

                    >
                    on January 19 – a feat that made Japan just the fifth nation
                    to reach Earth's sole natural satellite.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the mission was declared only a "minimum success"
                    because, while SLIM's autonomous precision landing system
                    worked, the craft tipped onto its side with its solar panels
                    pointed in a sub-optimal direction. The lander managed to
                    unload its pair of tiny experimental rovers and
                    <a

                    of the Moon, but the poorer-than-expected solar energy
                    production meant it could not perform some planned tasks and
                    it was put to sleep.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Happily, JAXA was able to

                    SLIM in late February after it unexpectedly survived a
                    terrifyingly cold lunar night.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On March 27, JAXA pinged SLIM just in case, and was pleased
                    that it responded – like when you try friending your high
                    school crush on Facebook.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The SLIM control room is normally calm and collected no
                    matter what happens, but the moment SLIM responded, it was
                    filled with loud cheers," reads a
                    <a
                      href="https://twitter.com/SLIM_JAXA/status/1773266278397939929"

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Other data sent home revealed that some of SLIM's
                    temperature sensors and unused battery cells are starting to
                    malfunction, but the majority of functions that survived the
                    first lunar night were still operational.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    JAXA continued to test SLIM on the night of March 29, by
                    "turning on switches and applying loads." But on the 30th
                    the lander again entered a dormant state and the space
                    agency’s crew tried to understand the state of the machine.

                    Tuesday. The company's senior vice president of grocery
                    stores says they're moving away from Just Walk Out, which
                    relied on cameras and sensors to track what people were
                    leaving the store with.

                  <p>
                    Just over half of Amazon Fresh stores are equipped with Just
                    Walk Out. The technology allows customers to skip checkout
                    altogether by scanning a QR code when they enter the store.
                    Though it seemed completely automated, Just Walk Out relied

                    Instead, Amazon is moving towards Dash Carts, a scanner and

                    to checkout as you shop. These offer a more reliable
                    solution than Just Walk Out. Amazon Fresh stores will also
                    feature self check out counters from now on, for people who

                    Since interacting with humans can be difficult, we've put
                    together a guide to a few key prompting techniques that will
                    help you get the most out of conversations with human
                    language models. But first, let's go over some of what HLMs
                    can do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Humans are complex and unpredictable models, so even
                    the most carefully crafted prompts can sometimes lead to
                    surprising outputs. Be patient, iterative, and open to
                    feedback from the person as you work to fine-tune your human
                    prompting skills. With practice, you'll be able to generate
                    the desired responses from people while also respecting
                    personal boundaries.

                    The technical aspects of the research are daunting for all
                    but a handful of mathematicians worldwide. In a nutshell,
                    the outcome of the team's research is a handy periodic table
                    of primes, or the PTP, pointing the locations of prime
                    numbers. The research is available as a working paper in the
                    SSRN Electronic Journal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] More to the point, the PTP has major applications
                    today in areas such as cyber security. Primes are already a
                    fundamental part of encryption and cryptography, so this
                    breakthrough means data can be made much more secure if we
                    can predict prime numbers, Kuo explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This advance in prime number research stemmed from working
                    on systems reliability design and a color coding system that
                    uses prime numbers to enable efficient encoding and more
                    effective color compression. During their research, the team
                    discovered that their calculations could be used to predict
                    prime numbers.

                    Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE)
                    Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) combined decades
                    of expertise in engineering, computation and theoretical
                    physics to design a new type of stellarator, a twisty
                    machine that confines plasma, the electrically charged
                    fourth state of matter, to harness the fusion process that
                    powers the sun and stars and potentially generate clean
                    electricity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Using permanent magnets is a completely new way to design
                    stellarators," said Tony Qian, a graduate student in the
                    Princeton Program in Plasma Physics, which is based at PPPL.
                    Qian was the lead author of papers published in the Journal
                    of Plasma Physics and Nuclear Fusion that detail the theory
                    and engineering behind the device, known as MUSE. "This
                    technique allows us to test new plasma confinement ideas
                    quickly and build new devices easily."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "MUSE is largely constructed with commercially
                    available parts," said Michael Zarnstorff, a senior research
                    physicist at PPPL and principal investigator of the project.
                    "By working with 3D-printing companies and magnet suppliers,
                    we can shop around and buy the precision we need instead of
                    making it ourselves."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The original insight that permanent magnets could be the
                    foundation for a new, more affordable stellarator variety
                    came to Zarnstorff in 2014. "I realized that even if they
                    were situated alongside other magnets, rare-earth permanent
                    magnets could generate and maintain the magnetic fields
                    necessary to confine the plasma so fusion reactions can
                    occur," Zarnstorff said, "and that's the property that makes
                    this technique work."

                    Markus Flierl, corporate veep for Intel's Developer Cloud,
                    is an IT veteran that survived both Sun's absorption by

                    Nvidia, before taking on the current role.

                    the Continuous Profiler, developed by Intel Granulate, in a
                    bid to up CPU performance. The theory goes that a
                    development team can run the optimization agent to spot
                    bottlenecks in code and, therefore, make apps more

                    We mention to Flierl that such generosity benefits Intel.
                    Software will eventually be optimized for Intel hardware.

                    "That's right, yeah," he says. "And I think that's just the
                    difference in approach that we have compared to some of our
                    competitors is that we're just very open. And we believe in
                    the community and the collaboration. And that's just one of
                    those examples of us doing that. And we want people to be
                    able to optimize the software, and to get the maximum out of
                    our hardware."

                    Intel's Developer Cloud is intended to give devs access to
                    its latest hardware, usually a good few months before its
                    rivals in the cloud space can get their hands on the
                    silicon. However, there is no escaping from the fact that
                    Intel trails the cloud giants in datacenter provision by
                    some distance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Has Intel done enough to persuade developers to use
                    its cloud rather than those of its rivals? Unsurprisingly,
                    Flierl reckons that the flexibility, with everything from
                    bare-metal Xeons through to managed Kubernetes, makes the
                    service a tempting choice.

                    artificial intelligence (AI) as evidence in the trial of a

                    lawyers wanted to enhance the video. They asked a video
                    production editor to use software that can "supercharge"

                    were "inaccurate, misleading, and unreliable." Experts said
                    the software is meant to make video more visually appealing
                    but may not reflect the truth.

                    Perusing the site, it’s immediately noticeable that lots of
                    the DNA-based speculations look very little like the person
                    arrested or charged. But that’s not really all that
                    problematic. Parabon’s “snapshots” aren’t meant to be
                    definitive descriptions of criminal suspects. They’re simply
                    meant to contribute to ongoing investigations by giving cops
                    something to post or hand out when asking people if they’ve
                    seen anyone resembling these speculative pictures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sure, there’s always a chance this may result in a wrongful
                    arrest or detention, but the company makes it clear these
                    are nothing more than a best guess based on DNA profiles.
                    It’s not great, but it’s not Parabon’s fault if cops decide
                    to go a step or two further than the purpose for which these
                    “snapshots” were intended.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That’s on the cops themselves. Parbon does not encourage
                    this sort of use of its DNA snapshots. But cops who
                    apparently have zero concern about adding AI speculation to
                    AI speculation to engage in investigations are making things
                    demonstrably worse by using Paragon’s “snapshots” for
                    reasons they were never intended. Wrong + wrong never equals
                    right.

                    In contrast to the grand spiral structure of our Milky Way,
                    these first galaxies exhibit irregular shapes without
                    rotational support. Within their central regions, a few
                    hundred to a few thousand second-generation stars (Pop II
                    stars) can form. The metallicity of the gas in the first
                    galaxies has been enriched to about 0.01 solar metallicity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The simulations also suggest that the first stars were not a
                    predominant component of most first galaxies, as gas in
                    massive halos was typically polluted by metals from other
                    Pop III supernovae during hierarchical assembly before
                    collapsing into pristine stars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These first galaxies are considered the landmark of the
                    cosmic dawn, and their direct detection in the universe is a
                    significant goal for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
                    and upcoming 30-meter-class ground-based telescopes. This
                    finding provides a bridge between the demise of the first
                    stars and the emergence of the first galaxies, offering
                    valuable insights into the physics of the cosmic dawn.

                    A few weeks ago, something from the heavens came crashing
                    through the roof of Alejandro Otero's home, and NASA is on
                    the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In all likelihood, this nearly two-pound object came from
                    the International Space Station. Otero said it tore through
                    the roof and both floors of his two-story house in Naples,
                    Florida.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Otero wasn't home at the time, but his son was there. A Nest
                    home security camera captured the sound of the crash at 2:34
                    pm local time (19:34 UTC) on March 8. That's an important
                    piece of information because it is a close match for the
                    time—2:29 pm EST (19:29 UTC)—that US Space Command recorded
                    the reentry of a piece of space debris from the space
                    station. At that time, the object was on a path over the
                    Gulf of Mexico, heading toward southwest Florida.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This space junk consisted of depleted batteries from the
                    ISS, attached to a cargo pallet that was originally supposed
                    to come back to Earth in a controlled manner. But a series
                    of delays meant this cargo pallet missed its ride back to
                    Earth, so NASA jettisoned the batteries from the space
                    station in 2021 to head for an unguided reentry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] If the object is owned by NASA, Otero or his insurance
                    company could make a claim against the federal government
                    under the Federal Tort Claims Act, according to Michelle
                    Hanlon, executive director of the Center for Air and Space
                    Law at the University of Mississippi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It gets more interesting if this material is discovered to
                    be not originally from the United States," she told Ars. "If
                    it is a human-made space object which was launched into
                    space by another country, which caused damage on Earth, that
                    country would be absolutely liable to the homeowner for the
                    damage caused."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This could be an issue in this case. The batteries were
                    owned by NASA, but they were attached to a pallet structure
                    launched by Japan's space agency.

                    treatment-resistant epileptic seizures by reducing the
                    excitability of neurons in the brain," Sethi said. "We

                    A few years later, Sethi coined the term metabolic

                    an energy conversion perspective.<br />...<br />The
                    psychiatric benefits were also striking. On average, the

                    illness known as the clinical global impressions scale, with
                    three-quarters of the group showing clinically meaningful
                    improvement. Overall, the participants also reported better

                    For those not keen on Microsoft Teams, help is in hand –
                    European Union requirements to unbundle the software from
                    Office 365 will be implemented globally.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During the pandemic lockdowns, Microsoft hoped Teams would
                    zoom past competing collaboration tools. But in 2020, Slack
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/07/22/slack_versus_teams/"
                      >complained</a
                    >
                    that bundling Teams into Office 365 licenses was unfair,
                    leading to a European antitrust investigation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The move leaves users with the option to carry on as
                    normal, remove Teams from licenses and enjoy a small
                    discount, or buy it as a standalone product.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That appears to be good news for Slack, Zoom, and others
                    that are looking to lure Microsoft customers to their own
                    collaboration apps. However, Google told us last year that
                    Microsoft's concession of unbundling Teams from Office 365
                    in the EEA was "<a

                      >too little, too late</a
                    >" as the tool had already amassed million of users.

                  <p>
                    The Coalition for Fair Software, a lobby group believed to
                    be backed by Google and AWS, pointed out that the change
                    made to Teams by Microsoft comes amid growing interest from
                    competition regulators in the vendor's wider licensing
                    policies with regard to
                    <a

                  <p>
                    In a statement, executive director Ryan Triplette, said: "By
                    simply extending the changes offered in Europe in August
                    2023, this announcement pays lip service to fair competition
                    but leaves interoperability and licensing restrictions in
                    place that prevent true customer choice. Despite the
                    shortcomings of the terms, they demonstrate that Microsoft
                    is capable of making changes when held accountable by
                    regulators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Microsoft's restrictive software licensing practices extend
                    well beyond Teams and are used to drive up costs and lock in
                    customers to their products throughout the cloud stack, from
                    Azure to security offerings. We urge all regulators,
                    including the US Federal Trade Commission, to take action to
                    address these practices and improve consumer choice."

                    Several big businesses have published source code that
                    incorporates a software package previously hallucinated by
                    generative AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not only that but someone, having spotted this reoccurring
                    hallucination, had turned that made-up dependency into a
                    real one, which was subsequently downloaded and installed
                    thousands of times by developers as a result of the AI's bad
                    advice, we've learned. If the package was laced with actual
                    malware, rather than being a benign test, the results could
                    have been disastrous.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Bar Lanyado, security researcher at Lasso
                    Security, one of the businesses fooled by AI into
                    incorporating the package is Alibaba, which at the time of
                    writing still includes a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is a legit huggingface-cli, installed using pip
                    install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the
                    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/huggingface-cli/"
                      >huggingface-cli</a
                    >
                    distributed via the Python Package Index (PyPI) and required
                    by Alibaba's GraphTranslator – installed using pip install
                    huggingface-cli – is fake, imagined by AI and turned real by
                    Lanyado as an experiment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He created huggingface-cli in December after seeing it
                    repeatedly hallucinated by generative AI; by February this
                    year, Alibaba was referring to it in GraphTranslator's
                    README instructions rather than the real Hugging Face CLI
                    tool.

                    is now well known and has caused no small amount of
                    embarrassment among attorneys unaware of this tendency. And
                    as it turns out, generative AI models will do the same for
                    software packages.

                    [...] So far at least, this technique hasn't been used in an
                    actual attack that Lanyado is aware of.

                    "Besides our hallucinated package (our package is not
                    malicious it is just an example of how easy and dangerous it
                    could be to leverage this technique), I have yet to identify
                    an exploit of this attack technique by malicious actors," he
                    said. "It is important to note that it's complicated to
                    identify such an attack, as it doesn't leave a lot of
                    footsteps."
