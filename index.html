                <div>
                  <p>
                    In 1886, a pharmacist named Dr. John Pemberton mixed extract
                    of the green coca leaf — containing the recently discovered
                    marvel of cocaine — with the caffeine kick of West African
                    kola nuts, making a "Brain Workers' Panacea" tonic called
                    Coca-Cola.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Touted to relieve mental and physical exhaustion, "Coke"
                    arrived alongside a wave of cocaine products advertised to
                    ease toothaches and labor pains. Cocaine was said to cure
                    fatigue, nervousness, impotence, even addiction to morphine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the medical miracle soon changed into the story of a
                    crime epidemic. Cocaine's addictive properties were
                    discovered and its increased availability fueled racial
                    fears: cocaine made Negroes insane and murderous; Jewish
                    doctors were identified as its peddlers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The United States began prohibition of coca leaf, along with
                    the cocaine it produces, with the Harrison Narcotics Act of
                    1914.

                    Amid fears of a US recession, there seems to be growing
                    impatience among investors when it comes to the massive
                    investment Big Tech has made into their AI products.

                    It has been a tough time for Big Tech in the stock market,
                    as some of the biggest companies in the world have shed
                    hundreds of billions in value after their latest earnings
                    failed to meet the growing demands of investors.

                  <p>
                    [...] The value of some of these companies has soared in
                    recent years, thanks to the major focus on AI technology,
                    which has been a hot topic in the tech industry. But recent
                    shifts in the stock market meant these companies were on
                    track to lose roughly $800bn in value,

                    many of these companies have put in AI technology, with the
                    payoff coming too slowly for some Wall Street investors.
                    This is despite the major boost this focus has had –

                    One looming concern in the AI sector is the future of
                    OpenAI, one of the key sparks of the generative AI hype
                    since the launch of its product ChatGPT. Microsoft has been
                    a major investor into OpenAI. But recent reports suggest

                Battery maker LG Energy Solution's second-quarter profit dropped
                58% year-on-year to 195.3 billion won ($141m), the company said

                    The company also faces increased competition from its

                    Car manufacturers have been calling for battery companies to
                    create cheaper cells to lower EV prices, which has applied
                    pressure to companies like LG Energy.

                    This led to LG Energy's chief technology officer, Kim
                    Je-Young, stating that the company would commercialise
                    dry-coating technology by 2028, a technology which makes
                    battery manufacturing cheaper and more efficient.

                    ($2.1bn) to Won15.6tn over the same period, as western EV

                Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a new
                type of 3D printer that knits 3-dimensional solid objects,
                according to a new paper published in ACM Transactions on
                Graphics. From the introduction:
              </p>
              <blockquote>

                  <p>
                    Unlike standard knitting, which makes hollow surfaces, solid
                    knitting makes dense volumes by layering knit sheets—much as
                    3D printers layer plastic sheets. We envision a future where
                    everyday objects like furniture or shoes—including soles—can
                    be knit as one piece. Since the layers are topologically
                    intertwined during fabrication, solid dense volume knitting
                    requires no adhesives, allowing fabricated objects to be
                    unraveled easily to recover the constituent yarn

                    X is suing a group of major advertisers over accusations
                    that they held an "illegal boycott" against the platform
                    formerly known as Twitter. In a lawsuit filed on Tuesday, X
                    claims Unilever, Mars, CVS, Ørsted, and dozens of other
                    brands conspired to "collectively withhold billions of
                    dollars in advertising revenue" through a World Federation
                    of Advertisers (WFA) industry initiative.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To join the WFA's initiative, called the Global Alliance for
                    Responsible Media (GARM), companies must agree to withhold
                    advertising from social platforms that aren't compliant with
                    the organization's safety standards. X alleges GARM
                    "organized an advertiser boycott of Twitter" to coerce the
                    company into following the initiative's safety standards.
                    The lawsuit is being filed despite X announcing that it was
                    "excited" to rejoin GARM last month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The evidence and facts are on our side," X CEO Linda
                    Yaccarino said in a video posted to X. "They conspired to
                    boycott X, which threatens our ability to thrive in the
                    future. That puts your global Town Square — the one place
                    that you can express yourself freely and openly — at
                    long-term risk."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It's not clear how well X's lawsuit will fare in court
                    because, as pointed out by Techdirt, the ability to choose
                    where to advertise is protected under the First Amendment.
                    The ad tech watchdog group Check My Ads similarly states
                    that advertisers have the right "to not send money to a
                    platform that promotes hate and conspiracies."

                    Legal experts say the case is unlikely to succeed as any
                    collusion or agreement between companies will be hard to

                    [...] Musk's lawsuit is based on a recent investigation of
                    Garm led by the judiciary committee of the
                    Republican-controlled US House of Representatives. It was
                    filed in an obscure federal court branch in Texas known for
                    a particular conservative judge. X's lawyer is a well-known
                    rightwing legal figure, not a big national law firm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] X's business issues are real enough. According to the
                    New York Times, X ad revenue in the US has collapsed to
                    $114mn in a recent quarter. Total group global revenue for
                    Twitter in 2021 was $5bn. The company has a $13bn debt pile
                    where annual interest expense is well above $1bn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Advertisers decided that, since there were only a
                    handful of dominant social networks, they needed to band
                    together in order to enforce standards. Garm and the
                    companies will have to show that while they perhaps
                    co-ordinated on some matters, there was nothing binding
                    about their alliance when it came to economic decisions. It
                    would be decidedly odd for any company to surrender their
                    autonomy to a trade association. Musk's burden is higher,
                    explaining exactly why profit-seeking companies would
                    irrationally avoid his product.

              <p>
                Raspberry Pi have released the small Pico 2 as an improvement to
                the original Pico:
                <a
                  href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-2-our-new-5-microcontroller-board-on-sale-now/"

                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                The small single board computer looks virtually unchanged from
                its predecessor. All improvement is in a new microcontroller
                unit, the RP2350, which replaces the old RP2040. Most notable
                features are twice the memory, low power sleep options, and two
                added Risc-V cores. The two ARM cores are still there, but
                upgraded to Cortex-M33 from M0+.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike the RP2040, the new MCU is available in different
                packages, with more pins and flash memory in-package. Top of the
                line will be the RP2354B with 80 pins and 2MB integrated flash.
              </p>

                of memory. We've come a long way since then! --MartyB)! )

                    [...] Meta has long faced scrutiny for its policies on
                    minors. It is being sued by 33 states accusing it of
                    deploying 'manipulative' practices toward young users, which
                    it denies. Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission is also
                    seeking to ban Meta from making money from teen audiences as
                    part of an update to an existing privacy settlement, which
                    the company is challenging in court.

                    [...] Spark was working on behalf of the Meta marketing data
                    science team and was tasked with getting more "Gen Z"
                    customers to download Instagram, which has been losing users
                    to rival apps, in particular TikTok, internal documents
                    show.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] On its website, Google says the "unknown" group
                    "refers to people whose age, gender, parental status or
                    household income we haven't identified." But staff at the
                    Internet group had thousands of data points on everything
                    from users' location via phone masts to their app downloads
                    and activity online. This allowed them to determine with a
                    high degree of confidence that those in the "unknown" group
                    included many younger users, in particular under-18s.

                    Turning off other age groups for which they had demographic
                    data left only the unknown group, with its high proportion
                    of minors and children: it was described as a way of
                    "hacking" the audience safeguards in their system, one of
                    the people said.

                    [...] During the pitching process, another email from Spark
                    in late 2023 asked Google to provide Meta with
                    "platform-specific data and insights into teen behavior."
                    This would "enable us to tailor and refine our media
                    tactics, messaging and creative execution," it read.

                  <p>
                    As part of its pitch, Google also boasted of its "really
                    impressive" usage by 13- to 17-year-olds, handily
                    outstripping daily engagement on TikTok and Instagram,
                    documents show.

                  <p>
                    Google won the mandate from Spark, and the teams on both
                    sides took precautions, banning any direct reference to the
                    age range in writing, one of the people said. Staff used
                    euphemisms in presentations, such as slides with only the
                    words "embrace the unknown," according to documents reviewed
                    by the FT.

                    Each August, the Perseid meteor shower provides a
                    breathtaking sight of bright meteors and fireballs, best
                    viewed in the early hours of August 12. These meteors,
                    hitting atmospheric speeds up to 132,000 mph, are part of a
                    display originating from Comet Swift-Tuttle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They may not attract as much attention as last month’s
                    daylight fireball over New York City, but stargazers can
                    still anticipate seeing some shooting stars with the
                    upcoming Perseid meteor shower. Caused by Earth passing
                    through trails of debris left behind by
                    <a
                      href="https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/109p-swift-tuttle/"
                      >Comet Swift-Tuttle</a
                    >, the shower has become famous over the centuries because
                    of its consistent display of celestial fireworks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The Perseids is the best annual meteor shower for the
                    casual stargazer,” said Bill Cooke, who leads NASA’s
                    <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/meteoroid-environment-office/"
                      >Meteoroid Environment Office</a
                    >
                    at the agency’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
                    Alabama. “Not only is the shower rich in bright meteors and
                    fireballs – No. 1 in fact – it also peaks in mid-August when
                    the weather is still warm and comfortable. This year, the
                    Perseid maximum will occur on the night of August 11 and
                    pre-dawn hours of August 12. You’ll start seeing meteors
                    from the shower around 11 p.m. local time and the rates will
                    increase until dawn. If you miss the night of the 11th, you
                    will also be able to see quite a few on the night of the
                    12th between those times.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The best way to see the Perseids is to find the darkest
                    possible sky and visit between midnight and dawn on the
                    morning of August 12. Allow about 45 minutes for your eyes
                    to adjust to the dark. Lie on your back and look straight
                    up. Avoid looking at cell phones or tablets because their
                    bright screens ruin night vision and take your eyes off the
                    sky.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perseid meteors travel at the blistering speed of 132,000
                    mph – or 500 times faster than the fastest car in the world.
                    At that speed, even a smidgen of dust makes a vivid streak
                    of light when it collides with Earth’s atmosphere. Peak
                    temperatures can exceed 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit as they
                    speed across the sky. The Perseids pose no danger to people
                    on the ground as practically all burn up 60 miles above our
                    planet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first Perseid captured by
                    <a href="https://fireballs.ndc.nasa.gov/"
                      >NASA’s All Sky Meteor Camera Network</a
                    >
                    was recorded at 9:48 p.m. EDT on July 23. The meteor – about
                    as bright as the planet Jupiter, so not quite bright enough
                    to be considered a fireball – was caused by a piece of Comet
                    Swift-Tuttle about 5 millimeters in diameter entering the
                    atmosphere over the Atlantic and burning up 66 miles above
                    St. Cloud, Florida, just south of Orlando.

                  <p>
                    It wasn’t part of the Perseids, but a rare daylight fireball
                    streaked across the sky over New York City at 11:15 a.m. EDT
                    on Tuesday, July 16. The event gained national attention and
                    was reported in media outlets across the U.S.

                    traversing a short path southwest and disintegrating about
                    31 miles above Mountainside, New Jersey. Cooke said the
                    meteor was likely about 1 foot in diameter, which would have
                    made the rock bright enough to see during the day. Seeing a
                    meteor of this size is rarer than catching sight of the
                    smaller particles a few millimeters in size typically seen
                    in the night sky.

                    Ph.D. student and lead author, Tian Du, also from the
                    University of Sydney, said, "Heparin is inexpensive,
                    ubiquitous and a World Health Organization-listed Essential
                    Medicine. After successful human trials, it could be rolled
                    out relatively quickly to become a cheap, safe and effective
                    drug for treating cobra bites."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team used CRISPR to find the human genes that cobra
                    venom needs to cause necrosis that kills the flesh around
                    the bite. One of the required venom targets are enzymes
                    needed to produce the related molecules heparan and heparin,
                    which many human and animal cells produce.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Heparan is on the cell surface and heparin is released
                    during an immune response. Their similar structure means the
                    venom can bind to both. The team used this knowledge to make
                    an antidote that can stop necrosis in human cells and mice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unlike current antivenoms for cobra bites, which are 19th
                    century technologies, the heparinoid drugs act as a 'decoy'
                    antidote. By flooding the bite site with 'decoy' heparin
                    sulfate or related heparinoid molecules, the antidote can
                    bind to and neutralize the toxins within the venom that
                    cause tissue damage.

                    Interventions at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,
                    said, "Snakebites remain the deadliest of the neglected
                    tropical diseases, with its burden landing overwhelmingly on
                    rural communities in low- and middle-income countries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our findings are exciting because current antivenoms are
                    largely ineffective against severe local envenoming, which
                    involves painful progressive swelling, blistering and/or
                    tissue necrosis around the bite site. This can lead to loss
                    of limb function, amputation and lifelong disability."

                    appearance, or if the process is the other way around —
                    that, over the years, the individual's facial appearance
                    changes to match the name given to them by their parents.

                  <p>
                    A new study reveals that a person's face tends to evolve to
                    suit their name, demonstrating the profound impact of social
                    expectations. The research showed that adults' faces could
                    be matched to their names with high accuracy, while
                    children's faces could not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Machine learning also found significant similarities among
                    adults with the same name. This effect, known as a
                    self-fulfilling prophecy, suggests that social constructs
                    can influence physical appearance over time.

                    In 1949, the Chrysler Corporation introduced a new disc
                    brake system, but it was nothing like the disc brakes we
                    know today. Here's how it worked.
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    As we can see, the Ausco Lambert bears no similarity to the
                    caliper-type disc brakes developed for aircraft in the
                    1940s, or those later adopted by Crosley, Dunlop, and
                    ultimately the entire auto industry. In its basic
                    configuration, the Lambert design sort of resembles the
                    familiar clutch-disc and pressure-plate arrangment for a
                    conventional manual transmission (as do the Milan and
                    Kinmont brakes) but there are some important differences
                    there, too.

                    He is said to have set up the exchange in December 2013,

                    In a sting operation in July, 2021, a FBI operative in
                    Florida registered an account with Cryptonator. The agent
                    spent around $4,195 in digicash at a known dark web site
                    that, it's claimed, trades in stolen identification records.
                    Court documents allege that Boss facilitated that purchase
                    via Cryptonator, telling the agent all transactions were
                    anonymous and currency would be "mixed" at his end to

                    undercover as an affiliate of a known ransomware group, is
                    said to have used a Cryptonator account to offer the
                    criminals fictitious stolen data in exchange for a cut of
                    the proceeds. That agent received Bitcoin worth $14,500 in
                    two transactions through Cryptonator, it's said.

                    NASA officials said on Wednesday the two astronauts
                    delivered to the International Space Station in June by
                    Boeing's Starliner could return on SpaceX's Crew Dragon in
                    February 2025 if Starliner is still deemed unsafe to return
                    to Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The U.S. space agency has been discussing potential plans
                    with SpaceX to leave two seats empty on an upcoming Crew
                    Dragon launch for NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni
                    Williams, who became the first crew to fly Boeing's
                    Starliner capsule.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The astronauts' test mission, initially expected to last
                    about eight days on the station, has been drawn out by
                    issues on Starliner's propulsion system that have
                    increasingly called into question the spacecraft's ability
                    to safely return them to Earth as planned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Boeing spokesperson said if NASA decides to change
                    Starliner's mission, the company "will take the actions
                    necessary to configure Starliner for an uncrewed return."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thruster failures during Starliner's initial approach to the
                    ISS in June and several leaks of helium – used to pressurize
                    those thrusters – have set Boeing off on a testing campaign
                    to understand the cause and propose fixes to NASA, which has
                    the final say. Recent results have unearthed new
                    information, causing greater alarm about a safe return.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The latest test data have stirred disagreements and debate
                    within NASA about whether to accept the risk of a Starliner
                    return to Earth, or make the call to use Crew Dragon
                    instead.
                  </p>

                    Using a SpaceX craft to return astronauts that Boeing had
                    planned to bring back on Starliner would be a major blow to
                    an aerospace giant that has struggled for years to compete
                    with SpaceX and its more experienced Crew Dragon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Starliner has been docked to the ISS for 63 of the maximum
                    90 days it can stay, and it is parked at the same port that
                    Crew Dragon will have to use to deliver the upcoming
                    astronaut crew.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Early Tuesday morning, NASA, using a SpaceX rocket and a
                    Northrop Grumman capsule, delivered a routine shipment of
                    food and supplies to the station, including extra clothes
                    for Wilmore and Williams.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Starliner's high-stakes mission is a final test required
                    before NASA can certify the spacecraft for routine astronaut
                    flights to and from the ISS. Crew Dragon received NASA
                    approval for astronaut flights in 2020.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Starliner development has been set back by management issues
                    and numerous engineering problems. It has cost Boeing $1.6
                    billion since 2016, including $125 million from Starliner's
                    current test mission, securities filings show.

                    fix should be available via BIOS updates from PC and
                    motherboard makers and from Microsoft as a Windows update.
                    But it will take time for those updates to roll out to
                    users, and Intel has said that processors that are already
                    exhibiting crashes have been permanently damaged and won't
                    be fixed by the microcode update.

                    anyone whose CPU is subtly damaged but not showing explicit
                    signs of instability, Intel is extending the warranty on all
                    affected 13th- and 14th-generation CPUs by an additional two

                    purchased processors and new ones that are bought from today
                    onward. For processors that came installed in pre-built PCs,
                    Intel says users are covered, but that they should reach out
                    to their PC's manufacturer for support. Those customers
                    should only contact Intel directly if they have a problem
                    getting a new CPU from the PC company.

                    [...] According to Intel, the root cause of the issue was "a
                    microcode algorithm resulting in incorrect voltage requests
                    to the processor," a bug that caused motherboards to supply
                    too much power to a CPU. This resulted in damage to the
                    silicon over time, leading to crashing and instability. The

                    [...] We all know this crap doesn't work and the sooner we
                    can stop pretending it makes a difference, the better.
                    AT&amp;T had every certification on the planet and still
                    didn't take the <em>incredibly</em> basic step of enforcing
                    2FA on a database of all the most sensitive data it has in
                    the world. If following these stupid checklists and
                    purchasing the required software ended up with more secure
                    platforms, I'd say "well at least there is a payoff". But
                    time after time we see the exact same thing which is an
                    audit is not an adequate replacement for someone who knows
                    what they are doing looking at your stack and asking hard
                    questions about your process. These audits aren't resulting
                    in organizations doing the hard but necessary step of taking
                    downtime to patch critical flaws or even applying basic
                    security settings across all of their platforms.

                    [...] I don't know what the solution is, but I know this
                    song and dance isn't working. The world would be better off
                    if organizations stopped wasting so much time and money on
                    these vendor solutions and instead stuck to
                    <em>much more basic</em> solutions. Perhaps if we could just
                    start with "have we patched all the critical CVEs in our
                    organization" and "did we remove the shared username and
                    password from the cloud database with millions of call
                    records", then perhaps AFTER all the actual work is done we
                    can have some fun and inject dangerous software into the
                    most critical parts of our employees devices.

                    “’Seemingly small friction points in user experiences can
                    have a dramatically disproportionate effect on whether
                    people drop or stick,’” Mehta wrote, quoting a document from
                    Google’s Behavioral Economics Team. You want to think about
                    each step, as small as it might be, and see if there is a
                    way to eliminate it, delay it, simplify it, default it…of
                    the tiny fraction of end users who try to change the
                    default, many will become frustrated and simply leave the
                    default as originally set.’”

                  <p>
                    [...] So what does all this mean for the user? The fallout
                    from this might take years to materialize. Mehta has
                    scheduled a follow-up hearing for September 6 where he’ll
                    talk about what should be done about Google’s monopoly
                    power. It’s possible he’ll recommend a selloff or
                    restructuring of some kind. He may even tell Google it has
                    to stop paying to be the default search engine on so many
                    devices.

                    As Walker said, Google will appeal. It has an army of
                    lawyers and billions of dollars, everything it needs to drag
                    its fight with the Justice Department as long as possible.

                    Military satellites from the United States, Russia, and
                    China also have RPO capabilities, but as far as we know,
                    these spacecraft have only maneuvered in ultra-close range
                    around so-called "cooperative" objects designed to receive
                    them. In 2003, the Air Force Research Laboratory launched a
                    small satellite named XSS-10 to inspect the upper stage of a
                    Delta II rocket in orbit, but it had a head start. XSS-10
                    maneuvered around the same rocket that deployed it, rather
                    than pursuing a separate target.

                    space junk is primarily due to debris-generating events,
                    such as anti-satellite tests or occasional explosions. The
                    number of active satellites has also increased to more than
                    7,000, driven by launches of mega-constellations like

                    fragments. Nearly half of these are in low-Earth orbit,
                    flying at altitudes up to 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers),
                    where most active satellites are located. Experts have

                    electrical energy that can cause explosions well after their

                    It takes some 2.4 to 2.7 seconds to send a signal to the
                    moon and back. If we are talking about sending a signal to
                    Mars and back, then the comparable delays are between 10 to
                    45 minutes. There is also the factor of extended
                    interruption where an orbiting spacecraft is behind the
                    object it is orbiting. If we look at communications with
                    other planets in the solar system, there is a periodic
                    interval when the planet aligns with the sun. For example,
                    for an interval of around two weeks, the Earth's view of
                    Mars is blocked by the Sun every two years.

                    Such protracted Round-Trip Time (RTT) intervals are well
                    beyond what we experience in the everyday Internet, even in
                    the most bizarre of fault scenarios! For an end-to-end
                    reliable protocol, the sender must retain a copy of the sent
                    data until it is acknowledged as received from the other
                    end. We have become used to a network where the RTT
                    intervals are of a few tens of milliseconds, so simple
                    interactions, such as a three-way TCP handshake, or a DNS
                    query and response can happen within the limits of human
                    perception. When such interactions blow out to some 30
                    minutes or so, is an end-to-end interaction model the right
                    architectural choice?

                    developed over the past two years. The company claimed that
                    while it's good against local tamping, it can be
                    circumvented by translating it and retranslating with
                    something like Google Translate or rewording it using
                    another AI generator. OpenAi also said those wishing to
                    circumvent the tool could "insert a special character in
                    between every word and then deleting that character."

                    Internal proponents of the program say it will do a lot to
                    help teachers figure out when their students have handed in
                    AI-generated homework. The company reportedly sat on this
                    program for years over concerns that close to a third of its
                    user base wouldn't like it. In an email statement, an OpenAI
                    spokesperson said:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>

                      <p>
                        "The text watermarking method we're developing is
                        technically promising, but has important risks we're
                        weighing while we research alternatives, including
                        susceptibility to circumvention by bad actors and the
                        potential to disproportionately impact groups like
                        non-English speakers. We believe the deliberate approach
                        we've taken is necessary given the complexities involved
                        and its likely impact on the broader ecosystem beyond

                  <p>
                    The other problem for OpenAI is the concern that if it
                    releases its tool broadly enough, somebody could decipher
                    OpenAI's watermarking technique. There is also an issue that

                    On July 27, the former US president and Republican nominee
                    for the upcoming election, Donald Trump, headlined the
                    biggest Bitcoin conference of the year in Nashville. In his
                    speech, Trump claimed he will make the US the "crypto
                    capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the
                    world" if returned to the White House after November's

                    Bitcoin prices plummeted after former President Donald Trump
                    suggested that the cryptocurrency could be used to pay off
                    the country's $35 trillion national debt.

                    Bitcoin dropped 12 percent in the past 24 hours and ether
                    plunged by 21 percent in the same time period. The price of
                    bitcoin has been dropping since Friday, and briefly dropped
                    to below $50,000 on Monday. This was the first time it had
                    dropped below these levels since February.

                  <p>
                    In recent weeks Trump has been attempting to position
                    himself firmly as pro-crypto. Speaking at a bitcoin
                    conference in Nashville, Tennessee on July 27, the
                    Republican presidential candidate unveiled his plans to make
                    the U.S. the "crypto capital of the planet" if he is elected
                    for a second term.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He also spoke about the U.S. creating a "strategic national
                    bitcoin reserve."

                    Neuralink's brain chip has been implanted into a second
                    patient as part of early human trials, Elon Musk told
                    podcast host Lex Fridman on Saturday. The company hasn't
                    disclosed when the surgery took place or the name of the
                    recipient, according to Reuters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Musk said 400 of the electrodes on the second patient's
                    brain are working out of 1,024 implanted. "I don't want to
                    jinx it but it seems to have gone extremely well," he said.
                    "There's a lot of signal, a lot of electrodes. It's working
                    very well."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The device allows patients with spinal cord injuries to play
                    video games, use the internet and control electronic devices
                    using their thoughts alone. In May, the company announced
                    that it was "accepting applications for the second
                    participant" in trials following FDA approval.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The original Neuralink implant patient, Nolan Arbaugh,
                    described the surgery as "super easy." In a demo, the
                    company showed how Arbaugh was able to move a cursor around
                    the screen of a laptop, pause an on-screen music device and
                    play chess and Civilization VI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Arbaugh himself participated in the marathon podcast with
                    Musk and Fridman. He said that the device allows him to make
                    anything happen on a computer screen just by thinking it,
                    helping reduce his reliance on caregivers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, problems cropped up shortly after his surgery when
                    some of electrodes retracted from his brain. The issue was
                    partly rectified later on by modifying the algorithm to make
                    the implants more sensitive. Neuralink told the FDA that in
                    a second procedure, it would place the implant's threads
                    deeper into the patient's brain to prevent them from moving
                    as much as they did in Arbaugh's case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] the company said it had over 1,000 volunteers for its
                    second surgical trial. Musk said he expects Neuralink to
                    implant its chips in up to eight more patients by the end of
                    2024.

                reviews the history of Bell Labs (going back into the late
                1800s). It ends with a section that wonders if re-creating a
                research monster like Bell Labs (peak employment = 25,000
                people) is possible today...or even needed. A sample from the
                middle:
              </p>

                    Though it had many successes in the first 25 years of its
                    life, the crowning achievement of Bell Labs research (and
                    its strategy of leveraging early-stage scientific research
                    to create new products) is undoubtedly its development of
                    the transistor, along with its various derivatives (the
                    MOSFET, the solar PV cell) and associated manufacturing
                    technologies (including crystal pulling, zone melting, and
                    diffusion furnaces). The transistor is a classic case of
                    Bell Labs' strategy: wide research freedom, circumscribed by
                    the requirement to produce things useful for the Bell
                    System. The telephone network required enormous amounts of
                    vacuum tubes [Bell Labs developed de Forest's tube into a
                    useful amplifier] and mechanical relays to act as switches,
                    but these were far from ideal components. ... Mervin Kelly,
                    physicist and head of the Bell Labs vacuum tube department
                    in the early 1930s (and later the president of Bell Labs),
                    dreamed of replacing them with solid-state components with
                    no moving parts. Advances in quantum mechanics, and novel
                    materials known as semiconductors, suggested that such
                    components might be possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bell Labs had studied semiconductors since the early 1930s;
                    Walter Brattain, who would eventually share the Nobel Prize
                    for inventing the transistor, was hired in 1929 and had
                    begun to study an early semiconductor device called the
                    copper oxide rectifier. A Depression hiring freeze stymied
                    more serious semiconductor efforts until 1936, when Mervin
                    Kelly (now Bell Labs' director of research) was finally able
                    to start building a more robust solid-state physics
                    department and hired physicist William Shockley (the second
                    of the three transistor inventors). While not giving
                    Shockley any specific research tasks (indeed, the entire
                    solid-state group had "unprecedented liberty to follow their
                    own research noses as long as their work dovetailed with
                    general company goals"), Kelly emphasized to Shockley the
                    potential value of a solid-state component to replace tubes
                    and mechanical relays.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The solid-state physicists continued their research over the
                    next several years, studying the behavior of semiconductors
                    and attempting to create a semiconductor amplifier. This
                    research was interrupted by the war but resumed in 1945, the
                    same year physicist John Bardeen was hired. Bardeen proved
                    to be the catalyst the solid-state group needed, and over
                    the next several years Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley made
                    progress in understanding semiconductor behavior. In
                    December 1947, they unveiled their semiconductor amplifier:
                    the transistor. By 1950, Western Electric was making 100
                    transistors a month for use in Bell System equipment. A few
                    years later, in 1954, another Bell Labs solid-state research
                    effort yielded the world's first silicon solar PV cell.

                One of the kids in my neighborhood (1960s) became a physicist
                and worked at Bell Labs for years--seemed to really like it
                there. Anyone else have a connection to tell about?

                about broken updates for in-car software. Starts out with a VW
                story:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>

                    In 2022, Jake Brown...bought a used 2017 Volkswagen Passat
                    from a local dealership.<br />[..]<br />Brown had heard that
                    some Volkswagens were having trouble with connected features
                    for a reason that, because of Brown's telecommunications
                    background, felt familiar to him: AT&amp;T, which Volkswagen
                    worked with to provide connectivity to the automaker's
                    vehicles, had "sunsetted" its 3G service that year.<br />[...]<br />The
                    3G sunset left drivers of some Volkswagens, including a
                    handful of models built between 2014 and 2019, unable to
                    access Volkswagen's Car-Net service. Car-Net includes remote
                    start, but also automated service notifications, emergency
                    assistance, antitheft alerts, and remote automatic crash
                    notifications, among other network-enabled features.

              <p>
                TFA goes on to say that several other manufacturers have the
                same problem--cars built with 3G connectivity have been timed
                out by the telcos--completely beyond control of the car
                manufacturer. A query by Wired to VW wasn't all that helpful--it
                seems there are already lawsuits about this and no solution in
                sight after several years since 3G stopped. They do mention that
                VW expect 4G (currently shipping in their cars) to last to 2035
                [but that may be wishful thinking--submitter].
              </p>
              <p>
                TFA also includes a discussion of expected service life of
                phones (a few years, updates for seven years) vs cars which
                average over 12 years (USA), with many at 20+.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your AC wonders why there isn't an option to ignore the built-in
                wireless modem and either: swap out the modem module, or connect
                the car (through USB or other cable) to a current phone [but
                this may have security problems?] Personally I'm not interested
                in any of these connected cars--and this is just another nail in
                the coffin for me.

                    Japanese researchers have discovered ice 0, a new type of
                    ice that forms near the surface of water, potentially
                    redefining scientific understanding and influencing
                    technology and climate studies. (Artist’s concept). Credit:

                  <p>
                    Ice is far more complex than most people realize, with
                    science identifying over 20 different varieties formed under
                    various combinations of pressure and temperature. The type
                    we use to chill our drinks, known as ice I, is one of the
                    few forms that occur naturally on Earth. Recently,
                    researchers from Japan discovered another type: ice 0, an
                    unusual form of ice that can initiate the formation of ice
                    crystals in supercooled water.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The formation of ice near the surface of liquid water can
                    start from tiny crystal precursors with a structure similar
                    to a rare type of ice, known as ice 0. In a study recently
                    published in <em>Nature Communications</em>, researchers
                    from the Social Cooperation Research Department “Frost
                    Protection Science,” at the
                    <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-tokyo/"
                      >Institute of Industrial Science, The University of
                      Tokyo</a
                    >
                    showed that these ice 0-like structures can cause a water
                    droplet to freeze near its surface rather than at its core.
                    This discovery resolves a longstanding puzzle and could help
                    redefine our understanding of how ice forms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Crystallization of ice, known as ice nucleation, usually
                    happens heterogeneously, or in other words, at a solid
                    surface. This is normally expected to happen at the surface
                    of the water’s container, where liquid meets solid. However,
                    this new research shows that ice crystallization can also
                    occur just below the water’s surface, where it meets the
                    air. Here, the ice nucleates around small precursors with
                    the same characteristic ring-shaped structure as ice 0.

                    To address the climate crisis effectively, immediate action
                    on methane emissions is essential. Methane has contributed
                    about half the global warming we’ve experienced so far, and
                    emissions are climbing rapidly. An international team of
                    climate researchers writing today (July 30) in
                    <em>Frontiers in Science</em> set out three imperatives to
                    cut methane emissions and share a new tool to help us find
                    the most cost-effective ways of doing so.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The world has been rightly focused on carbon dioxide, which
                    is the largest driver of climate change to date,” said
                    Professor Drew Shindell of Duke University, lead author.
                    “Methane seemed like something we could leave for later, but
                    the world has warmed very rapidly over the past couple of
                    decades, while we’ve failed to reduce our CO2 emissions. So
                    that leaves us more desperate for ways to reduce the rate of
                    warming rapidly, which methane can do.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Methane is the second most potent greenhouse gas, but only
                    about 2% of global climate finance goes towards cutting
                    methane emissions. These emissions are also rising fast, due
                    to a combination of emissions from fossil fuel production
                    and increased emissions from wetlands, driven by the climate
                    crisis. To slow the damage from climate change and make it
                    possible to keep global warming below 2°C, we need to act
                    immediately, following the Global Methane Pledge to reduce
                    methane emissions by 30% from their 2020 level by 2030.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Methane doesn’t accumulate in the atmosphere in the
                    long term, so emissions reductions take effect more quickly.
                    If we could cut all methane emissions tomorrow, in 30 years
                    more than 90% of accumulated methane—but only around 25% of
                    carbon dioxide—would have left the atmosphere.

                    The Space Shuttle contained a bulky printer so the
                    astronauts could receive procedures, mission plans, weather
                    reports, crew activity plans, and other documents. Needed
                    for the first Shuttle launch in 1981, this printer was
                    designed in just 7 months, built around an Army
                    communications terminal. Unlike modern printers, the
                    Shuttle's printer contains a spinning metal drum with raised
                    characters, allowing it to rapidly print a line at a time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This printer is known as the Space Shuttle Interim
                    Teleprinter System.1 As the name "Interim" suggests, this
                    printer was intended as a stop-gap measure, operating for a
                    few flights until a better printer was operational. However,
                    the teleprinter proved to be more reliable than its
                    replacement, so it remained in use as a backup for over 50
                    flights, often printing thousands of lines per flight. This
                    didn't come cheap: with a Shuttle flight costing $27,000 per
                    pound, putting the 59-pound teleprinter in space cost over
                    $1.5 million per flight.

                    In copper-containing materials called cuprates,
                    superconductivity competes with two properties called
                    magnetic spin and electric charge density wave (CDW) order.
                    These properties reveal different parts of the electrons in
                    the superconductor. Each electron possesses spin and charge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a regular metal, the spins cancel each other out and
                    electrical charges are uniform across a material. However,
                    the strong electron–electron interactions in
                    high-temperature superconductors such as cuprates give rise
                    to other possible states.

                    in <i>Nature Communications</i> has examined materials where
                    strong magnetic interaction causes some of the electron
                    spins to order along stripes. This occurs when spin density
                    waves (SDW) and CDWs lock together to form a stable
                    long-range "stripe state" where the peaks and valleys of the
                    two waves are aligned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This state reinforces the stability of the SDW and CDW. This
                    stripe state competes with and interrupts the
                    superconducting phase. Now, however, researchers have found
                    that short-range CDW can be compatible, rather than
                    competitive, with superconductivity in cuprate materials.
                    This finding runs counter to scientific conventional wisdom.

                  <p>
                    [...] The research also identified the possibility that
                    short-range charge order may enable the formation and motion
                    of vortices in the superconducting phase. This means
                    researchers may be able to stabilize superconductivity at
                    higher temperatures and magnetic fields by controlling or
                    enhancing short-range charge order.

                    In an era when anyone can create artificial intelligence
                    (AI) images, the ability to detect fake pictures,
                    particularly deepfakes of people, is becoming increasingly
                    important. Now, scientists say the eyes may be the key to
                    distinguishing deepfakes from real images.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    New research presented at the Royal Astronomical Society's
                    National Astronomy Meeting indicates that deepfakes can be
                    identified by analyzing the reflections in human eyes,
                    similar to how astronomers study pictures of galaxies. The
                    study, led by University of Hull MSc student Adejumoke
                    Owolabi, focuses on the consistency of light reflections in
                    each eyeball. Discrepancies in these reflections often
                    indicate a fake image.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The reflections in the eyeballs are consistent for the real
                    person, but incorrect (from a physics point of view) for the
                    fake person," said Kevin Pimbblet, professor of astrophysics
                    and director of the Centre of Excellence for Data Science,

                    Researchers analyzed reflections of light on the eyeballs of
                    people in real and AI-generated images. They then employed
                    methods typically used in astronomy to quantify the
                    reflections and checked for consistency between left and
                    right eyeball reflections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fake images often lack consistency in the reflections
                    between each eye, whereas real images generally show the
                    same reflections in both eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To measure the shapes of galaxies, we analyze whether
                    they're centrally compact, whether they're symmetric, and
                    how smooth they are. We analyze the light distribution,"
                    said Pimbblet. "We detect the reflections in an automated
                    way and run their morphological features through the CAS
                    [concentration, asymmetry, smoothness] and Gini indices to
                    compare similarity between left and right eyeballs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The findings show that deepfakes have some differences
                    between the pair."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Gini coefficient is normally used to measure how the
                    light in an image of a galaxy is distributed among its
                    pixels. This measurement is made by ordering the pixels that
                    make up the image of a galaxy in ascending order by flux and
                    then comparing the result to what would be expected from a
                    perfectly even flux distribution. A Gini value of 0 is a
                    galaxy in which the light is evenly distributed across all
                    of the image's pixels, while a Gini value of 1 is a galaxy
                    with all light concentrated in a single pixel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team also tested CAS parameters, a tool originally
                    developed by astronomers to measure the light distribution
                    of galaxies to determine their morphology, but found it was
                    not a successful predictor of fake eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's important to note that this is not a silver bullet for
                    detecting fake images," Pimbblet added. "There are false
                    positives and false negatives; it's not going to get
                    everything. But this method provides us with a basis, a plan
                    of attack, in the arms race to detect deepfakes."

                    When giant solar storms hit Earth, they trigger beautiful
                    auroral displays high in Earth's atmosphere. There's a dark
                    side to this solar activity, though. The "space weather" it
                    sets off also threatens our technology. The potential for
                    damage is why we need highly accurate predictions of just
                    when these storms will impact our planet's magnetosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To figure that out, scientists in England went to the
                    source: specific places on the sun where these storms erupt.
                    Those outbursts are called coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
                    They're huge explosions of magnetically charged particles
                    and gases from the sun. They travel through space and hit
                    whatever is in their way, including planets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When that cloud of charged particles hits our magnetic
                    field, it sets off a chain reaction of events. Of course, it
                    creates beautiful auroral displays—northern and southern
                    lights that dance in the skies. But, they also slam into and
                    can damage orbiting satellites, including all our
                    telecommunications and navigation systems for planes, boats,
                    and trains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team found a very strong relationship between the
                    critical height of the CME as it gets started and its true
                    speed as it moves out. "This insight allows us to predict
                    the CME's speed and, consequently, its arrival time on
                    Earth, even before the CME has fully erupted," Ghandhi said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Knowing the actual speed of the CME to a higher degree of
                    accuracy will let solar physicists predict when it will hit
                    Earth. That, in turn, will allow satellite operators, grid
                    owners, space agencies, and others to prepare for the action
                    and protect their assets.

                    Researchers propose a lunar biorepository to protect Earth's
                    endangered species by utilizing the Moon's cold temperatures
                    for long-term storage of biological samples. This initiative
                    seeks to overcome Earth's natural and political risks by
                    fostering global collaboration and developing new
                    technologies for space transport and sample preservation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Faced with the threat of extinction for numerous species, an
                    international team of researchers has suggested a
                    groundbreaking solution to safeguard the planet's
                    biodiversity: a lunar biorepository. As outlined in a recent
                    article in the journal <em>BioScience</em>, this plan
                    involves establishing a passive, enduring storage facility
                    on the moon for cryopreserved samples of Earth's most
                    endangered animal species.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Led by Dr. Mary Hagedorn of the Smithsonian's National Zoo
                    and Conservation Biology Institute, the team envisions
                    taking advantage of the Moon's naturally cold temperatures,
                    particularly in permanently shadowed regions near the poles,
                    where temperatures remain consistently below –196 degrees
                    Celsius. Such conditions are ideal for long-term storage of
                    biological samples without the need for human intervention
                    or power supplies, two factors that could threaten the
                    resilience of Earth-based repositories. Other key advantages
                    of a lunar facility include protection from Earth-based
                    natural disasters, climate change, and geopolitical
                    conflicts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An initial focus in the development of a lunar biorepository
                    would be on cryopreserving animal skin samples with
                    fibroblast cells. The author team has already begun
                    developing protocols using the Starry Goby (<em
                      >Asterropteryx semipunctata</em
                    >) as an exemplar species, with other species to follow. The
                    authors also plan to "leverage the continental-scale
                    sampling that is currently underway at the U S National
                    Science Foundation's National 190 Ecological Observatory
                    Network (NEON)" as a source for future fibroblast cell
                    development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Challenges to be addressed include developing robust
                    packaging for space transport, mitigating radiation effects,
                    and establishing the complex international governance
                    frameworks for the repository. The authors call for broad
                    collaboration among nations, agencies, and international
                    stakeholders to realize this decades-long program. The next
                    steps include expanding partnerships, particularly with
                    space research agencies, and conducting further testing on
                    Earth and aboard the International Space Station.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite the challenges to be overcome, the authors highlight
                    that the need for action is acute: "Because of myriad
                    anthropogenic drivers, a high proportion of species and
                    ecosystems face destabilization and extinction threats that
                    are accelerating faster than our ability to save these
                    species in their natural environment."

                    optical communications, which use infrared light signals
                    instead of the more conventional radio waves to transmit
                    data. As part of these efforts, it recently conducted a
                    series of flight tests that involved installing a laser
                    terminal on the belly of a Pilatus PC-12 aircraft. This
                    single-engine plane then proceeded to beam 4K video while
                    soaring over Lake Erie to a ground station in Cleveland,
                    Ohio.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From there, the video signal went on an epic journey,
                    passing through NASA's White Sands facility in New Mexico
                    before being fired off into space 22,000 miles away using
                    infrared lasers towards an experimental satellite called the
                    Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD). The LCRD
                    then relayed the data to a special terminal aboard the ISS
                    called ILLUMA-T, which beamed it back to Earth.

                    Despite this incredibly long distance, NASA says the laser
                    link achieved transmission rates of over 900 Mbps. To put
                    that into perspective, the average household internet in the
                    US churns out 245 Mbps as of June 2024.

                    For many years, insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor
                    spraying have been crucial and highly effective methods for
                    controlling mosquitoes that spread malaria, a serious global
                    health threat. These strategies have also, incidentally,
                    helped to reduce populations of other unwanted household
                    pests such as bed bugs, cockroaches, and flies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, a new
                    <a

                    study reviewing the academic literature on indoor pest
                    control shows that as the household insects developed
                    resistance to the insecticides targeting mosquitoes, the
                    return of these bed bugs, cockroaches and flies into homes
                    has led to community distrust and often abandonment of these
                    treatments – and to rising rates of malaria.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In short, the bed nets and insecticide treatments that were
                    so effective in preventing mosquito bites – and therefore
                    malaria – are increasingly viewed as the causes of household
                    pest resurgence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “These insecticide-treated bed nets were not intended to
                    kill household pests like bed bugs, but they were really
                    good at it,” said Chris Hayes, an NC State Ph.D. student and
                    co-corresponding author of a paper describing the work.
                    “It’s what people really liked, but the insecticides are not
                    working as effectively on household pests anymore.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Non-target effects are usually harmful, but in this case
                    they were beneficial,” said Coby Schal, Blanton J. Whitmire
                    Distinguished Professor of Entomology at NC State and
                    co-corresponding author of the paper.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The value to people wasn’t necessarily in reducing malaria,
                    but was in killing other pests,” Hayes added. “There’s
                    probably a link between the use of these nets and widespread
                    insecticide resistance in these house pests, at least in
                    Africa.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers say that all hope is not lost, though.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “There are, ideally, two routes,” Schal said. “One would be
                    a two-pronged approach with both mosquito treatment and a
                    separate urban pest management treatment that targets pests.
                    The other would be the discovery of new malaria-control
                    tools that also target these household pests at the same
                    time. For example, the bottom portion of a bed net could be
                    a different chemistry that targets cockroaches and bed bugs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “If you offer something in bed nets that suppresses pests,
                    you might reduce the vilification of bed nets.”

                    China controls approximately 75% of global lithium-ion

                    [...] While the absence of the high-tech industrial capacity
                    needed for economic security is easy to label, it is not
                    simple to address. Doing so requires several interrelated
                    elements, among them designing and incentivizing appropriate
                    capital investments, creating and matching demand for a
                    talented technology workforce, building robust industrial
                    infrastructure, ensuring visibility into supply chains, and
                    providing favorable financial and regulatory environments
                    for on- and friend-shoring of production. This is a project
                    that cannot be done by the public or the private sector
                    alone. Nor is the US likely to accomplish it absent
                    carefully crafted shared partnerships with allies and
                    partners across both the Atlantic and the Pacific.

                    The opportunity to support today’s drones may have passed,
                    but we do have the chance to build a strong industrial base
                    to support tomorrow’s most critical technologies—not simply
                    the eye-catching finished assemblies of autonomous vehicles,
                    satellites, or robots but also their essential components.
                    This will require attention to our manufacturing
                    capabilities, our supply chains, and the materials that are
                    the essential inputs. Alongside a shift in emphasis to our
                    own domestic industrial base must come a willingness to plan
                    and partner more effectively with allies and partners.

                    If we do so, we will transform decades of US and allied
                    support for foundational science and technology into
                    tomorrow’s industrial base vital for economic prosperity and
                    national security. But to truly take advantage of this
                    opportunity, we need to value and support our shared,
                    long-term economic security. And this means rewarding
                    patient investment in projects that take a decade or more,
                    incentivizing high-capital industrial activity, and
                    maintaining a determined focus on education and workforce
                    development—all within a flexible regulatory framework.

                Several decades ago, a torn UCL was generally a career ending
                injury. In 1974, Dodgers' pitcher
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_John"
                  >Tommy John</a
                >
                was the first baseball player to undergo a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_John_surgery"
                  >UCL reconstruction</a
                >, which involves grafting a tendon in place of the UCL, taking
                the tendon from elsewhere in the body or a donor. The procedure
                has become known as "Tommy John surgery" and has a high success
                rate, though with a long recovery time. However, continuing to
                pitch with high velocity and spin rates has led to the injury
                recurring a few years later and requiring a second surgery.
                There is also evidence that

                pitcher can rest between pitches. Although the pitch clock
                improves the pace of games, it has

              <p>
                The obvious question is why pitchers would be willing to throw
                pitches at high velocities and spin rates knowing that the
                result is likely Tommy John surgery. The answer is that there
                are only so many spots on a major league roster available, and
                if one pitcher isn't willing to assume that risk, someone else
                will. The best starting pitchers get massive contracts that pay
                tens of millions of dollars per year, so there's a lot of money
                potentially available for those willing to accept the high risk
                of injuries. Even at lower levels, pitchers know that if they
                want to be successful, they need to be able to throw the ball
                hard. There has even been

                Fortunately, the same data that allows us to link pitch velocity
                and spin rate with effectiveness may also offer a solution to
                reduce injuries. Tracking pitch velocity and spin rate can allow
                us to determine how frequently pitchers are throwing pitches
                that contribute most to UCL injuries. One proposal is to
                <a
                  href="https://blogs.fangraphs.com/a-high-velocity-usage-tax-a-proposal-to-protect-pitchers/"
                  >track the number of high risk pitches thrown by each pitcher
                  and imposing a cap on a pitcher's innings in a season</a
                >, progressively lowering that cap for pitchers who throw more
                high risk pitches. Part of a pitcher's value to a team is their
                availability. If a pitcher is unavailable because they've
                reached their innings cap, they're less valuable to a team,
                providing an incentive to reduce the number of pitches thrown at
                high velocity and perhaps high spin rates. The proposed rule in
                the linked article focuses on fastballs, but a similar strategy
                could be applied to other high risk pitches.

                    Many commentators have questioned why an organization would
                    join their ESXi hosts to AD in the first place, despite it
                    being a relatively common practice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Why are ESX servers joined with an active directory in the
                    first place? Because it is convenient to manage admin access
                    to servers using a centralized platform in large
                    corporations," Dr Martin J Kraemer, security awareness
                    advocate at KnowBe4, told <em>The Register</em>. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is very common but also creates challenges. In many
                    environments, the AD itself might run on a VM. Cold boot can
                    be a nightmare. A chicken and egg problem. How can you start
                    ESX without AD while AD runs on ESX? Admins must think about
                    this. A well-known challenge.

                    [...] "Over the last year, we have seen ransomware actors
                    targeting ESXi hypervisors to facilitate mass encryption
                    impact in few clicks, demonstrating that ransomware
                    operators are constantly innovating their attack techniques
                    to increase impact on the organizations they target," it
                    said.

                  <p>
                    Microsoft also said that ESXi hypervisors often fly further
                    under the radar in security operations centers (SOCs)
                    because security solutions often don't have the necessary
                    visibility into ESXi, potentially allowing attackers to go
                    undetected for longer periods of time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because of the destruction a successful ESXi attack could
                    cause, attacks have risen sharply. In the past three years,
                    the targeting of ESXi hypervisors has doubled.

                  <p>
                    [...] Microsoft recommends that all ESXi users install the
                    available patches and scrub up their credential hygiene to
                    prevent future attacks, as well as use a robust
                    vulnerability scanner, if you don't already.

                From ScienceBlog: A comprehensive analysis of 24
                state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) has uncovered a
                significant left-of-center bias in their responses to
                politically charged questions. The study, published in PLOS ONE,
                sheds light on the potential political leanings embedded within
                AI systems that are increasingly shaping our digital landscape.
              </p>
              <p>
                The underlying paper at PLOS One:
                <a
                  href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306621"
                  >https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306621</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The researcher used a variety of tests of political alignment to
                assess the bias of some Large Language Models (LLMs) and found
                that they exhibited a left-of-center bias. To discover whether
                that bias can be affected by changing the training data,
                versions of LLMs were trained on selected sources, producing
                biases to order.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's a question for the community: Is the 'centerpoint' of
                political bias, as judged by these tests, arbitrary and
                reflective of the gamut of bias that is accepted as normal at
                this time? Is that centerpoint an absolute that can be used as a
                reference, or is it simply an artifact of how the political
                universe is currently understood? It seems to me that the phase
                space it exists in is limited by the kinds of political
                organizations which are preset in the world today, and that
                there might be valid solutions which have not yet been explored.

                    The IBM report suggests that severe staffing shortages are
                    linked to higher data breach costs – more than half of the
                    604 organisations studied had severe or high-level staffing
                    shortages last year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Businesses with high levels of staffing issues had an
                    average data breach cost of €5.28m, compared to €3.66m for
                    businesses with lower levels. This trend may be reduced in
                    the near future, as more organisations said they are
                    planning to increase security budgets compared to last year.

                    An international team of scientists, including two
                    researchers who now work in the Center for Advanced Sensor
                    Technology (CAST) at UMBC, has shown that twisted carbon
                    nanotubes can store three times more energy per unit mass
                    than advanced lithium-ion batteries. The finding may advance
                    carbon nanotubes as a promising solution for storing energy
                    in devices that need to be lightweight, compact, and safe,
                    such as medical implants and sensors. The research

                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers studied single-walled carbon
                    nanotubes, which are like straws made from pure carbon
                    sheets only 1-atom thick. Carbon nanotubes are lightweight,
                    relatively easy to manufacture, and about 100 times stronger
                    than steel. Their amazing properties have led scientists to
                    explore their potential use in a wide range of
                    futuristic-sounding technology, including
                    <a

                  <p>
                    To investigate carbon nanotubes' potential for storing
                    energy, the UMBC researchers and their colleagues
                    manufactured carbon nanotube "ropes" from bundles of
                    commercially available nanotubes. After pulling and twisting
                    the tubes into a single thread, the researchers then coated
                    them with different substances intended to increase the
                    ropes' strength and flexibility.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team tested how much energy the ropes could store by
                    twisting them up and measuring the energy that was released
                    as the ropes unwound. They found that the best-performing
                    ropes could store 15,000 times more energy per unit mass
                    than steel springs, and about three times more energy than
                    lithium-ion batteries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The stored energy remains consistent and accessible at
                    temperatures ranging from -76 to +212 °F (-60 to +100 °C).
                    The materials in the carbon nanotube ropes are also safer
                    for the human body than those used in batteries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Humans have long stored energy in mechanical coil springs
                    to power devices such as watches and toys," Kumar Ujjain
                    says. "This research shows twisted carbon nanotubes have
                    great potential for mechanical energy storage, and we are
                    excited to share the news with the world."

                    been that it is fair use. Anyone can copy it, re-create with
                    it, reproduce with it. That has been freeware, if you like.
                    That's been the understanding." Suleyman added that his

                to parody site
                <a href="https://clownstrike.lol/">ClownStrike</a>, a clear
                abuse of United States copyright law, as the site in question is
                undoubtably covered by fair use in United States copyright law.
                Editor: See first link for more detail.

                  <p>
                    It is unfortunately well known that the DMCA is used by
                    corporate cyberbullies to take down content that they
                    disagree with; but, is otherwise legal. The Counternotice
                    system is also hillariously ineffective. The DMCA requires
                    service providers to "act expeditiously to remove or disable
                    access to the infringing material;" yet, it gives those same
                    "service providers" 14 days to restore access in the event
                    of a counternotice! The DMCA, like much American
                    legislation, is heavily biased towards corporations, instead
                    of the actual, living, breathing, citizens of the country.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's absolutely asinine and I would love absolutely nothing
                    more than to have a lawsuit "win" against CrowdStrike. That
                    would be absolutely amazing for marketing! Especially given
                    the timing of such events...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, using the Digital Millenium Copyright Act to
                    attempt to takedown a parody site for Trademark Infringement
                    is absolutely hillarious.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are several ways that anyone is allowed to use a
                    trademark belonging to "others." This is considered "Fair
                    Use." Fair Use is an important aspect of trademark and
                    copyright law. It is a right to use trademarks and
                    copyrighted works for parody, criticism, transformative
                    works, news reporting / journalism, education, etc.
                    Corporate cyberbullies don't like that anyone else has
                    rights. Again, I don't care, because the only thing that
                    matters is the law, and what a court thinks about it.

                    The authors also predict that the expansion of the boundary
                    conditions has its consequences: a new kind of quantum
                    entanglement appears in the theory, mixing past and future,
                    which is not present in conventional particle theory. The
                    paper also raises the question of whether tachyons described
                    in this way are purely a ‘mathematical possibility’ or
                    whether such particles are likely to be observed one day.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the authors, tachyons are not only a
                    possibility but are, in fact, an indispensable component of
                    the spontaneous breaking process responsible for the
                    formation of matter. This hypothesis would mean that Higgs
                    field excitations, before the symmetry was spontaneously
                    broken, could travel at superluminal speeds in the vacuum.

                    The AI Act won’t be felt until six months, when prohibitions
                    will apply against unacceptable-risk AI applications. The
                    rules for general-purpose AI models will apply one year from
                    now, while the majority of rules of the AI Act will start
                    applying on 2 August 2026.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, EU member states have until 2 August 2025 to
                    designate “national competent authorities”, which will
                    oversee the application of the AI Act and carry out market
                    surveillance activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With AI making its way into so many use cases, it will be
                    important for businesses of all sizes to consider the type
                    of AI systems they are using and where they fall into the AI
                    Act’s risk tiers. Phil Burr, head of product at Lumai, said
                    the biggest risk businesses face is ignoring the Act.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The good news is that the Act takes a risk-based approach
                    and, given that the vast majority of AI will be minimal or
                    low-risk, the requirements on businesses using AI will be
                    relatively small,” Burr said. “It’s likely to be far less
                    than the effort required to implement the GDPR regulations,
                    for example.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The biggest problem for compliance is the need to document
                    and then perform regular assessments to ensure that the AI
                    risks – and therefore requirements – haven’t changed. For
                    the majority of businesses there won’t be a change in risk,
                    but business at least need to remember to perform these.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While businesses have plenty of time to prepare, the road
                    ahead is not clear for them. Forrester principal analyst
                    Enza Iannopollo noted that firms don’t have any pre-existing
                    experience of complying with these type of rules, which adds
                    “complexity to the challenge”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Right now, it’s crucial that organisations ensure they
                    understand what theirs and their providers’ obligations are
                    in order to be compliant on time,” Iannopollo said. “This is
                    the time for organisations to map their AI projects,
                    classify their AI systems and risk assess their use-cases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “They also need to execute a compliance roadmap that is
                    specific to the amount and combination of use-cases they
                    have. Once this work is done, every company will have a
                    compliance roadmap that is unique to them.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To bridge the period between now and the full implementation
                    of the Act, the European Commission has launched the ‘AI
                    Pact’, which is initiative for AI developers to voluntarily
                    adopt key obligations of the Act ahead of its legal
                    deadlines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The EU has been introducing stronger penalties for breaches
                    in its more recent legislation, with the Digital Markets Act
                    and Digital Services Act carrying heavy fines for
                    non-compliance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The AI Act is no exception to this approach, as companies
                    that breach the Act could face fines of up to 7pc of their
                    global annual turnover for violations of banned AI
                    applications. They will also face fines of up to 3pc for
                    violations of other obligations and up to 1.5pc for
                    supplying incorrect information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “For reference, GDPR caps maximum fines to 4pc of
                    annual turnover, whereas EU competition law caps this at
                    10pc,” Koskinen said. “This comparison shows a clear
                    movement in regulatory enforcement for the AI Act, as the
                    maximum fines inch closer to those imposed on
                    anticompetitive behaviour.

                  <p>
                    “As businesses around the world look to Europe, the AI Act’s
                    requirements will lead the way in responsible AI innovation
                    and governance, while ensuring organisations are prepared
                    for its rapidly approaching enforcement.”

                Just to give you advance notice that the continual problem with
                the renewal of SSL certificates is due to occur on Monday 5 Aug.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nobody in the new team has the necessary access nor knowledge of
                the current hardware configuration, and control remains with
                NCommander. The transfer of assets has been initiated but as one
                of the two members of the current Board is out of the country
                everything has temporarily ground to a halt. We cannot
                reconfigure the existing structure as legally we do not yet
                'own' the database or existing hardware assets.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have requested that NCommander assist by renewing the
                certificates but that depends upon his availability. He has been
                kind enough to help in the past. There is nothing more I can do
                at the moment.
              </p>
              <p>
                I know that this is easily fixed - but until the formal exchange
                of the assets takes place we are on very shaky ground with
                regards to liabilities and responsibilities.

                    The Cheshire ATT facility is an underground complex
                    originally built in 1966. It was an underground terminal and
                    repeater station for the hardened analog L4 carrier cable
                    (coax) that went from Miami to New England carrying general
                    toll circuits and critical military communication circuits.
                    It reportedly housed an AUTOVON 4-wire switch as part of the
                    switching fabric of that critical global military
                    communications network. Cheshire also connected via
                    terrestrial microwave to the major, semi-hardened AT&amp;T
                    Durham station which linked to many other sites including
                    paths to New London (Navy Sub base) and to Green Hill, RI to
                    meet a transatlantic cable to Europe.

                  <p>
                    Amazon failed to adequately alert more than 300,000
                    customers to serious risks—including death and
                    electrocution—that US Consumer Product Safety Commission
                    (CPSC) testing found with more than 400,000 products that
                    third parties sold on its platform.<br />[...]<br />Instead
                    of recalling the products, which were sold between 2018 and
                    2021, Amazon sent messages to customers that the CPSC said
                    "downplayed the severity" of hazards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In these messages—"despite conclusive testing that the
                    products were hazardous" by the CPSC—Amazon only warned
                    customers that the products "may fail" to meet federal
                    safety standards and only "potentially" posed risks of "burn
                    injuries to children," "electric shock," or "exposure to
                    potentially dangerous levels of carbon monoxide."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Typically, a distributor would be required to specifically
                    use the word "recall" in the subject line of these kinds of
                    messages, but Amazon dodged using that language entirely.<br />[...]<br />The
                    CPSC has additional concerns about Amazon's "insufficient"
                    remedies. It is particularly concerned that anyone who
                    received the products as a gift or bought them on the
                    secondary market likely was not informed of serious known
                    hazards. The CPSC found that Amazon resold faulty hair
                    dryers and carbon monoxide detectors, proving that secondary
                    markets for these products exist.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Amazon has made no direct attempt to reach consumers who
                    obtained the hazardous products as gifts, hand-me-downs,
                    donations, or on the secondary market," the CPSC said.<br />[...]<br />After
                    the CPSC's testing, Amazon stopped allowing these products
                    to be listed on its platform, but that and other remedies
                    were deemed insufficient. So, over the next two months, to
                    protect the public, Amazon must now make a plan to "provide
                    notice of the product hazards to purchasers and the public"
                    and "incentivize the removal of these hazardous products
                    from consumers' homes," the CPSC ordered.<br />[...]<br />To
                    make up for "significant deficiencies" in Amazon's initial
                    messaging, mandatory recall notices will likely include "a
                    description of the product (including a photograph), hazard,
                    injuries, deaths, action being taken, and remedy," provide
                    "relevant dates and number of units" sold, and specifically
                    use "the word 'recall' in the heading and text," the CPSC
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Amazon's spokesperson told Ars that "in the event of a
                    product recall in our store, we remove impacted products
                    promptly after receiving actionable information from
                    recalling agencies, and we continue to seek ways to innovate
                    on behalf of our customers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our recalls alerts service also ensures our customers are
                    notified of important product safety information fast, and
                    the recalls process is effective and efficient," Amazon's
                    spokesperson said.

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    In recent weeks, two refreshed car models have been
                    launched: Hyundai's Ioniq 5 and BYD's SEAL. Both models,
                    introduced in 2021 and 2022 respectively, are receiving
                    significant updates ahead of the typical five-year facelift
                    cycle. This global automotive industry standard generally
                    involves cosmetic upgrades to keep cars relevant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, these updates are more than just aesthetic. The
                    Hyundai Ioniq 5 now features a substantial battery upgrade,
                    increasing from 72.6 kWh to 84 kWh. This enhancement boosts
                    the top model's range from 480 km to over 550 km. Other
                    upgrades include new wheel designs and interior materials,
                    but the major improvements lie beneath the surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These updates reflect a broader trend among electric
                    vehicle (EV) manufacturers, who have announced major
                    enhancements to existing models. Unlike mid-life upgrades in
                    gasoline cars, which often focus on superficial enhancements
                    like sound systems and wheel designs, EV upgrades are core
                    technological improvements. This trend is driven by several
                    factors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Recent trends in the used EV market show that the
                    introduction of significantly upgraded models or superior
                    competing models can deter buyers unless substantial
                    discounts are offered. The new Ioniq 5's increased range and

                    >Cybercrime is a real issue but equating it with any crime
                    involving ICTs is conceptually and practically harmful.
                    Recent efforts at the domestic level to broaden its
                    definition have led to the criminalization of legitimate
                    activities, such as online criticism, religious expression,
                    or LGBTQ support. In the proposed treaty, it encourages
                    expansive interpretations that could lead to human rights
                    abuses and transnational repression.
                    <b>Recommendation:</b> Restrict the definition to "core
                    cybercrimes" like technical attacks on computers, devices,
                    data, and communications systems. Exclude human
                    rights-protected activities from the scope of the treaty to
                    prevent misuse and ensure these rights are not unjustly
                    targeted due to equating cybercrime with any crime using
                    ICT.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Expansive Scope and Over-Criminalization Risks: </b> The
                    draft Convention's criminalization chapter dangerously
                    broadens its scope by including crimes like "grooming" and
                    CSAM, not just cybercrimes. Its CSAM definition risks
                    criminalizing consensual conduct between minors. Even worse,
                    a proposed Protocol could add two more Ad Hoc sessions to
                    discuss even more crimes, further expanding its broad scope.
                    <b> Recommendation</b> : Criminalization must be limited to
                    Articles 7 to 11. Narrow the scope of the CSAM article to
                    target only intentional, malicious actions, exclude from
                    criminalization consensual activity between minors, make
                    exemptions for self-generated content by minors mandatory,
                    ensure financing provisions target only those knowingly
                    involved in illegal activities, and exclude the public
                    interest use of such materials, such as evidence in crime
                    investigations, and scientific or artistic materials.

                    Border agents need a warrant before they can access what the
                    Supreme Court has called 'a window onto a person's life'
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The ruling makes clear that border agents need a warrant
                    before they can access what the Supreme Court has called 'a
                    window onto a person's life'."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Knight Institute, alongside the Reporters Committee for
                    Freedom of the Press (RCFP), filed an amicus brief in
                    support of Sultanov's objection to the initial warrantless
                    search of his device. They argued that, specifics of the
                    case aside, allowing warrantless searches of cellphones at
                    the border - which the Department of Justice has long held
                    extends 100 miles from the actual physical edge of the US -
                    were likely to not only infringe upon fundamental rights
                    guaranteed by the constitution, but would have a chilling
                    effect on the ability of journalists to protect their
                    sources. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Letting border agents freely rifle through journalists'
                    work product and communications whenever they cross the
                    border would pose an intolerable risk to press freedom,"
                    RCFP lawyer Grayson Clary said in a statement. "This
                    thorough opinion provides powerful guidance for other courts
                    grappling with this issue, and makes clear that the
                    Constitution would require a warrant before searching a
                    reporter's electronic devices."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is not the first case to challenge CBP's sweeping
                    authority to seize and search devices at or near the US
                    border, and it probably won't be the last one either. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Wilkens told us Morrison's decision was "thorough and
                    very well reasoned," and that he's confident it will hold up
                    to scrutiny if the government appeals that one, too.
                    Regardless, he believes the matter is ripe for a national
                    decision before the US Supreme Court, aka SCOTUS. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There is a good chance this issue will end up in the
                    Supreme Court, because of its importance and because the
                    circuit courts are reaching conflicting results," Wilkins
                    said.
