                    Globalization is over, at least for the chip industry, and
                    this will mean higher chip prices, according to
                    semiconductor contract manufacturer giant TSMC. Despite
                    this, the company's founder said he supports US actions to
                    slow the development of China's chip technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Taiwanese chip company is caught up in the ongoing
                    semiconductor battle between the superpowers, where the US
                    is trying to prevent China from getting access to cutting
                    edge technology that might be used by its burgeoning
                    military. At least, that is the reason given.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At an event hosted by Taiwan's CommonWealth Magazine in
                    Taipei, retired TSMC founder Morris Chang said that efforts
                    to contain China were leading to a split in the global
                    supply chain that would likely increase prices and could
                    have an effect on chip availability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There's no question in my mind that, in the chip sector,
                    globalization is dead. Free trade is not quite that dead,
                    but it's in danger," Chang said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It has already been noted that US efforts to isolate
                    China are leading to an undoing of the distributed global
                    supply chain infrastructure that has built up over the past
                    few decades.

                    the outcome may be a world divided into China-centric and
                    US-Europe-centric networks of supply chains and a greater
                    self-reliance within those blocks.

                    Intel's recently introduced Xeon W9-3495X processor packs 56
                    cores begging you to overclock them, as the CPU also
                    features an unlocked multiplier. When cooled down using
                    liquid nitrogen, the 56-core processor can indeed be pushed
                    to a formidable 5.50 GHz frequency, but at such high clocks
                    it alone consumes almost 1,900 watts, more than beefy
                    high-end gaming PCs, reports

                    Elmor, a professional overclocker who collaborates with
                    Asus, recently tried to push a Xeon W9-3495X 'Sapphire

                    to its limits with liquid nitrogen cooling. When frozen to
                    -92.8 degrees Celsius/-135 degrees Fahrenheit, the CPU can
                    work at 5.50 GHz and hit 132,220 points in Cinebench R23,
                    which is just a little bit lower than the absolute record of

                    the result comes at a cost.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The heavily overclocked Intel Xeon W9-3495X processor not
                    only demonstrates phenomenal performance in Cinebench R23,
                    but it also sets record in terms of power consumption. The
                    CPU draws as much as 1,881W power when operating at 5.50 GHz
                    and requires two 1,600W PSUs to feed it.

                  <p>
                    [...] Without any doubts, hitting 5.50 GHz with a 56-core
                    Xeon W9-3495X processor cooled down using liquid nitrogen is
                    a monumental achievement. Yet, it remains to be seen what
                    makers of boutique factory-overclocked extreme workstations
                    manage to squeeze out of this CPU with a production-grade
                    cooling system and guaranteed long-term stability.

                      >HX99 RNV Retina Projection Camera kit</a
                    >, a compact camera with an add-on retinal laser housing for
                    projecting the camera's focused live view image into the
                    user's eye. The low-power laser projection is designed to
                    effectively bypass the focusing of the eye, helping users
                    with visual impairments like shortsightedness,
                    farsightedness, or astigmatism see a clear image.

                    It uses Sony's existing DSC-HX99 compact camera, which is a
                    somewhat middling model from 2018 with an 18-megapixel
                    sensor and equivalent zoom lens of 24-720mm (30x
                    magnification), combined with QD Laser's Retissa Neoviewer
                    projector. According to
                    <a
                      href="https://retissa.biz/en/retissa-neoviewer#:~:text=discover%20your%20life.-,RETISSA%20NEOVIEWER,-Name"
                      >QD Laser's specs</a
                    >, the Retissa Neoviewer uses an RGB semiconductor laser to
                    display an image with an equivalent of 720p resolution and
                    8-bit color depth. This beamed image has an approximate
                    60-degree horizontal field of view with 60Hz refresh, and
                    the housing's battery has an estimated four hours of battery
                    life. Tragically, it charges via Micro USB instead of USB-C.

                    Remember Second Life? The virtual world launched on the
                    desktop web back in 2003 with 3D avatars and spaces for
                    various social activities. Believe it or not, it has been
                    running continually this entire time—and now it's coming to
                    mobile for the first time.

                  <p>
                    In fact, this will be the first time that Second Life has
                    expanded beyond the PC (across Windows, macOS, and Linux) in
                    any form.

                    [...] Another interesting thing going on here is how people
                    expect that the robots want to be "fed" trash and recycling:

                      <p>
                        Occasionally, people thought the robots expected trash
                        from them and felt obligated to give the robots
                        something. As the robot passed and stopped by the same
                        person for the second time, she said: "I guess it knows
                        I've been sitting here long enough, I should give it
                        something." Some people would even find an excuse to
                        generate trash to "satisfy" and dismiss the trash barrel
                        by searching through a bag or picking rubbish up off the
                        floor.

                    [...] I wonder how much of this social interaction is
                    dependent on the novelty of meeting the trash barrel robots
                    for the first time, and whether (if these robots were to
                    become full-time staff) humans would start treating them
                    more like janitors. I'm also not sure how well these robots
                    would do if they were autonomous. If part of the magic comes
                    from having a human in the loop to manage what seems like
                    (but probably aren't) relatively simple human-robot
                    interactions, turning that into effective autonomy could be
                    a real challenge.

                    pregnancy or soon after giving birth, according to the
                    latest data on the maternal mortality rate.

                    There remains a wide disparity in the maternal mortality
                    rate for Black women, at 69.9 deaths per 100,000 live
                    births, compared with white women, at 26.6 per 100,000. Many

                    The U.S. maternal mortality rate has risen overall since
                    2018. The highest rate is among non-Hispanic Black women
                    compared with Hispanic women and non-Hispanic white women.

                    The maternal deaths captured by the NCHS report are those
                    that occur during pregnancy or within 42 days of the end of
                    the pregnancy, "from any cause related to or aggravated by
                    the pregnancy or its management." These causes include
                    hemorrhaging, infections and high blood pressure disorders
                    such as eclampsia.

                    Yet in countless ways, scientists have done just that. In
                    some cases, the reasons for this have been well-meaning
                    ones, as with the priority to diversify the populations
                    involved in medical studies. In other cases, scientists have
                    carelessly allowed social views of race to influence
                    research that could otherwise have had a solid empirical
                    foundation. Finally, true believers in racial essentialism
                    have always twisted scientific results to support their
                    views.

                    The NIH, as the largest funder of biomedical research on the
                    planet, has been forced to navigate our growing
                    understanding of genetics while trying to diversify both the
                    researchers it funds and the participants who volunteer to
                    be part of these studies. NIH thus commissioned the National
                    Academies to generate this report, presumably in the hope it
                    would provide evidence-based guidelines on how to manage the
                    sometimes competing pressures.

                  <p>
                    The resulting report makes clear why racial thinking needs
                    to go. A summary of the mismatch between <em>race</em> and
                    <em>science</em> offers welcome clarity on the problem:

                        In humans, race is a socially constructed designation, a
                        misleading and harmful surrogate for population genetic
                        differences, and has a long history of being incorrectly
                        identified as the major genetic reason for phenotypic
                        differences between groups. Rather, human genetic
                        variation is the result of many forces—historical,
                        social, biological—and no single variable fully
                        represents this complexity. The structure of genetic
                        variation results from repeated human population mixing
                        and movements across time, yet the misconception that
                        human beings can be naturally divided into biologically
                        distinguishable races has been extremely resilient and
                        has become embedded in scientific research, medical
                        practice and technologies, and formal education.

                    The results of racial thinking are problematic in a variety
                    of ways. Historically, we've treated race as conveying some
                    essential properties, and thinking of populations in terms
                    of race tends to evoke that essentialist perspective—even
                    though it's clear that any population has a complicated
                    mixture of genetic, social, and environmental exposures.
                    Essentialist thinking also tends to undermine recognition of
                    the important role played by those environmental and social
                    factors in shaping the population.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The report also notes that science's racial baggage leads to
                    sloppy thinking. Scientists will often write in broad racial
                    terms when they're working with far more specific
                    populations, and they'll mention racial groups even when
                    it's not clear that the information is even relevant to
                    their results. These tendencies have grown increasingly
                    untenable as we've gotten far better at directly measuring
                    the things that race was meant to be a proxy for, such as
                    genetic distance between individuals.

                    Even if the White House selects a new nominee in the next
                    few weeks, it could take months for them to be vetted and
                    confirmed by the Senate. If the White House drags its feet
                    in finding a replacement, Biden could be without a fifth
                    commissioner when the 2024 election season begins. "The FCC
                    deadlock, now over two years long, will remain so for a long
                    time," Sohn said in a statement announcing her withdrawal
                    last week. "It is a sad day for our country and our
                    democracy when dominant industries, with assistance from
                    unlimited dark money, get to choose their regulators."

                    Net neutrality, which bans internet service providers from
                    favoring or degrading the quality of specific services, was
                    one of Biden's big-ticket promises. But as it's an issue
                    that mostly splits down party lines, the FCC's stalemate has
                    left his hands tied — putting states in charge of issuing
                    their own patchwork rules.

                    His 2021 infrastructure package required the agency to craft
                    rules that would ensure all Americans, despite income
                    status, have equal access to the internet. The agency has
                    until November to draft these new digital discrimination
                    rules, but civil rights groups fear it may be impossible to
                    roll out meaningful protections without a third

                    of color and low income communities, even if companies don't
                    intentionally discriminate," the Leadership Conference on
                    Civil and Human Rights said in a February statement on the

                    CPUs and GPUs. Lots of technology in there. We were able to
                    achieve an exascale of supercomputing, both from a
                    performance standpoint and, more importantly, from an
                    efficiency standpoint. Now we draw the line, assuming that
                    [we can] keep that pace of innovation going. ... That's a
                    challenge for all of us to think through. How might we

                    Supercomputing efficiency is doubling every 2.2 years, but
                    that still projects to a zettascale system around 2035

                    the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District
                    of New York says. "Singh and Ceraolo unlawfully used a

                    database maintained by a federal law enforcement agency that

                    Without clocks or modern tools, ancient Mexicans watched the
                    sun to maintain a farming calendar that precisely tracked
                    seasons and even adjusted for leap years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before the Spanish arrival in 1519, the Basin of Mexico's
                    agricultural system fed a population that was
                    extraordinarily large for the time. Whereas Seville, the
                    largest urban center in Spain, had a population of fewer
                    than 50,000, the Basin, now known as Mexico City, was home
                    to as many as 3 million people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To feed so many people in a region with a dry spring and
                    summer monsoons required advanced understanding of when
                    seasonal variations in weather would arrive. Planting too
                    early, or too late, could have proved disastrous. The
                    failure of any calendar to adjust for leap-year fluctuations
                    could also have led to crop failure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Though colonial chroniclers documented the use of a
                    calendar, it was not previously understood how the Mexica,
                    or Aztecs, were able to achieve such accuracy. New UC
                    Riverside research, published in the Proceedings of the
                    National Academy of Sciences, demonstrates how they did it.
                    They used the mountains of the Basin as a solar observatory,
                    keeping track of the sunrise against the peaks of the Sierra
                    Nevada mountains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We concluded they must have stood at a single spot, looking
                    eastwards from one day to another, to tell the time of year
                    by watching the rising sun," said Exequiel Ezcurra,
                    distinguished UCR professor of ecology who led the research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To find that spot, the researchers studied Mexica
                    manuscripts. These ancient texts referred to Mount Tlaloc,
                    which lies east of the Basin. The research team explored the
                    high mountains around the Basin and a temple at the
                    mountain's summit. Using astronomical computer models, they
                    confirmed that a long causeway structure at the temple
                    aligns with the rising sun on Feb. 24, the first day of the
                    Aztec new year.

                    The leading explanation for the origin of the moon proposes

                    >
                    (<em>SN: 5/12/16</em>). These are regions through which
                    seismic waves are known to move anomalously slow.
                    Researchers had previously proposed these regions could have
                    formed from old, subducted plates<em>.</em> But in 2021,
                    Yuan and colleagues alternatively proposed that the

                    [...] While the simulations suggest the large low-shear
                    velocity provinces could have had a hand in starting
                    subduction, it's not yet clear whether these masses came
                    from Theia. "The features ... are a fairly recent
                    discovery," says geodynamicist Laurent Montési of the
                    University of Maryland in College Park. "They're very
                    fascinating structures, with a very unknown origin." As
                    such, he says, it's too early to say that Theia triggered
                    plate tectonics.

                    "It's provoking. This material down there is something
                    special," Montési says of the large low-shear velocity
                    provinces. "But whether it has to be originally
                    extraterrestrial, I don't think the case is made."

                    A data center about the size of a washing machine is being
                    used to heat a public swimming pool in England.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Data centers' servers generate heat as they operate, and
                    interest is growing in finding ways to harness it to cut
                    energy costs and offset carbon emissions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this latest example, the computing technology has been
                    placed inside a white box and surrounded by oil, which
                    captures the heat before being pumped into a heat exchanger,
                    according to a
                    <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64939558"
                      >BBC report</a

                  <p>
                    The setup is effective enough to heat a council-run swimming
                    pool in Exmouth, about 150 miles west of London, to about 86
                    degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) for about 60% of the
                    time, saving the operator thousands of dollars. And with
                    energy costs rising sharply in the U.K., and councils
                    looking for ways to save money, an initiative like this
                    could be the difference between the pool staying open and
                    closing down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Behind the idea is U.K.-based tech startup Deep Green. In
                    exchange for hosting its kit, Deep Green installs free
                    digital boilers at pools and pays for the energy that they
                    use. Meanwhile, tech firms pay Deep Green to use its
                    computing power for various artificial intelligence and
                    machine learning projects.

                    claiming a larger slice of the market, the European
                    Commission says Qualcomm began selling its UMTS chipsets to
                    the likes of Huawei and ZTE at prices its rival couldn't
                    match.

                    [...] The European Commission ultimately smacked Qualcomm
                    with a €242 million fine for its behavior. As Qualcomm's
                    profits reached $12.9 billion last year, the fine is
                    significant but not very damaging.

                    that Qualcomm Attorney, Miguel Rato claimed the European
                    Commission was on a "crusade" against the company. Rato also
                    called into question the basis for the Commission's
                    argument, arguing the specific market for 3G baseband chips
                    accounted for less than a percent of the overall UMTS market
                    at the time.

                    WR 124 was actually one of the first observations made by
                    JWST in June 2022, the space agency said, but the image has
                    been unveiled just now. The Wolf-Rayet phase is a brief
                    condition some stars go through during their lifetime before
                    turning into supernovae, which makes Webb's observations a
                    valuable asset to astronomers studying the life of stars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    WR 124 is 30 times the mass of our Sun, NASA said, and it
                    has "shed" 10 Suns' worth of material so far. The ejected
                    gas moves away from the central body and cools down, forming
                    cosmic dust and glowing in the infrared light that is
                    detectable by Webb's advanced instruments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Before Webb, astronomers investigating cosmic dust
                    simply had no way to capture detailed images and information
                    about a dust-rich environment like the WR 124 nebula. And
                    dust, NASA said, plays an essential role in the inner
                    working of the universe as it shelters forming stars, and
                    gathers together to help shape planets, molecules and even
                    the building blocks of life on Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dust is a fundamental element for our universe, and yet
                    scientists still have to explain why the universe seemingly
                    contains more dust than our current dust-formation theories
                    can justify. The universe is "operating with a dust budget
                    surplus," NASA remarked.

                    [...] In the new study, Deisseroth and his colleagues used a
                    light attached to a tiny vest over a mouse's genetically
                    engineered heart to change the animal's heart rate. When the
                    light was off, a mouse's heart pumped at about 600 beats per
                    minute. But when the team turned on a light that flashed at
                    900 beats per minutes, the mouse's heartbeat followed suit.
                    "It's a nice reasonable acceleration, [one a mouse] would
                    encounter in a time of stress or fear," Deisseroth explains.

                    When the mice felt their hearts racing, they showed
                    anxiety-like behavior. In risky scenarios — like open areas
                    where a little mouse might be someone's lunch — the rodents
                    slunk along the walls and lurked in darker corners. When
                    pressing a lever for water that could sometimes be coupled
                    with a mild shock, mice with normal heart rates still
                    pressed without hesitation. But mice with racing hearts
                    decided they'd rather go thirsty.

                    eventually factor into how doctors treat panic and anxiety,
                    Beyeler says. But the path between the lab and the clinic,
                    she notes, is much more convoluted than that of the heart to
                    the head.

                    carefully. "Disappointing" to them is the equivalent of
                    "terrible job" anywhere else.

                    [...] Even without laws and executive orders, the company
                    could be in trouble. The US government spends billions of
                    dollars on Microsoft systems and services every year, a
                    revenue stream that could be endangered if Microsoft doesn't
                    adhere to the standards.

                    A second set of related chemicals (PFNA, PFHXs, PFBS, and
                    GenX Chemicals) will be regulated as a collective. Each will
                    have limits set on the levels allowable. The levels of each
                    will be calculated as a percentage of that limit, and the
                    percentages totalled; if they exceed 100 percent, then the
                    regulations will kick in.

                    these chemicals. It also says that a variety of means of
                    extracting these chemicals from water are now available.

                    say that in some regions the period from 6000BC to 2000BC
                    may be a high point in conflict and violence with the
                    destruction of entire communities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings also suggest the rise of growing crops and
                    herding animals as a way of life, replacing hunting and
                    gathering, may have laid the foundations for formalised
                    warfare.

                    [...] More than ten per cent showed damage potentially
                    caused by frequent blows to the head by blunt instruments or
                    stone axes. Several examples of penetrative injuries,
                    thought to be from arrows, were also found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some of the injuries were linked to mass burials, which
                    could suggest the destruction of entire communities, the
                    researchers say.

                    [...] The Department of Transportation is now accepting
                    applications for its $2.5 billion Charging and Fueling
                    Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program, which will hand
                    out funds to cities, counties, regional governments and
                    tribes to help deploy EV chargers, hydrogen fuel stations
                    and other reduced-emissions systems near their residents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Half of the program's funding will go to chargers and
                    stations in "publicly accessible" places like parking
                    facilities, parks and schools. The rest will install this
                    equipment in "alternative fuel corridors" along highways to
                    help with long-distance travel. The initial round of funding
                    will make $700 million available, with the rest coming over
                    the program's five-year span. Officials have to apply no
                    later than May 30th.

                  <p>
                    The initiative is part of [a] broader campaign to build
                    500,000 charging stations by 2030, or about five times as
                    many as there were in early 2022. The money, assigned as
                    part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is meant to
                    ensure charging access within 50 miles of someone's location
                    in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
                    While the effort is intended to spur overall EV adoption,
                    there's an added focus on underserved communities like some
                    urban and rural areas.

                    A strong charging infrastructure is widely considered vital
                    to successfully transitioning away from combustion engine
                    cars. Existing stations can

                    currently being stowed away by the Perseverance Rover on the

                    as 2030, an increase from $800 million originally assigned

                    highlighted as part of the budget include the James Webb

                    whose search engine can attain the speediest, most profound
                    enshittification via chatbot, replacing links to web-pages

                    Blockchain was a solution in search of a problem. So is AI.
                    Yes, Buzzfeed will be able to reduce its wage-bill by
                    automating its personality quiz vertical, and Spotify's "AI

                    thing, the most exciting part of the "internet in the '90s"
                    was that it had incredibly low barriers to entry and wasn't
                    dominated by large companies – indeed, it had them running

                    The AI bubble, by contrast, is being inflated by massive
                    incumbents, whose excitement boils down to "This will let
                    the biggest companies get much, much bigger and the rest of
                    you can go fuck yourselves." Some revolution.

                    AI has all the hallmarks of a classic pump-and-dump,
                    starting with terminology. AI isn't "artificial" and it's
                    not "intelligent." "Machine learning" doesn't learn. On this
                    week's Trashfuture podcast, they made an excellent (and
                    profane and hilarious) case that ChatGPT is best understood
                    as a sophisticated form of autocomplete – not our new robot
                    overlord.

                    On Monday, a three-judge panel at the appeals court ruled
                    that workers could be treated as independent contractors.
                    However it removed a clause, which put restrictions on
                    collective bargaining by workers, from Proposition 22.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shares in Uber and Lyft were almost 5% higher in after-hours
                    trading.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Today's ruling is a victory for app-based workers and
                    millions of Californians who voted for Prop 22," Tony West,
                    chief legal officer at Uber said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Tens of millions of people work in the global gig
                    economy across services like food delivery and transport.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gig workers are paid for individual tasks, such as a food
                    delivery or a car journey, rather than getting a regular
                    wage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most US federal and state labour laws, such as those
                    requiring a minimum wage or overtime pay, do not apply to
                    gig workers.

                    worst-case scenario. But Europe needs a lot. "We're talking
                    about a sea, a sea's worth of water," says Hannah Cloke at
                    the University of Reading in the UK. In terms of volume,
                    hundreds of millions of cubic liters of rain would have to
                    fall across the continent to fill the deficit, she
                    estimates. It would have to amount to higher-than-average
                    rainfall for France and certain other places, including
                    parts of the UK. The chances of that are, unfortunately, not
                    high.

                    [...] I suspect that many of these entrepreneurs will reach
                    a valuation of many millions of dollars (depending on the
                    type of cloud tech business) after a couple of years and
                    average growth. I've seen this personally a great many
                    times. Beats most 401(k)s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also interesting, according to the survey, 93% report they
                    are now competing with the company that let them go. [...]

                    This will have an overall positive effect on the technology
                    industry and cloud computing specifically, given that these
                    types of businesses drive more innovation. They are not
                    hindered by large corporate governance and company politics.
                    Creativity and innovation are directly rewarded with sales
                    and higher business value. This will also increase the
                    number of wealthy people in the technology industry since
                    this model will better disburse wealth among more technology
                    industry contributors.

                    TikTok has a large science community, and the social network
                    wants everyone to know it on Pi Day (March 14). The company
                    is launching a dedicated STEM (science, technology,
                    engineering and math) feed that shows only these more
                    educational videos. You may learn to code or discuss
                    experiments without having to wade through TikTok's usual
                    entertainment-focused content.

                    study content to make sure it's relevant to the STEM feed,
                    while the fact-checkers at Poynter will gauge the accuracy.
                    Any videos that don't pass both inspections won't reach the
                    new feed.

                    Users in the US will start seeing the STEM feed in the
                    "coming weeks," TikTok says. The social media giant has
                    already been experimenting with a "Topic Feed" in some
                    regions to court fans of gaming, sports and other common
                    subjects. The science-oriented feed is considered an
                    expansion of this initiative.

                    HRL Laboratories, LLC, has published the first demonstration
                    of universal control of encoded spin qubits. This newly
                    emerging approach to quantum computation uses a novel
                    silicon-based qubit device architecture, fabricated in HRL's
                    Malibu cleanroom, to trap single electrons in quantum dots.
                    Spins of three such single electrons host energy-degenerate
                    qubit states, which are controlled by nearest-neighbor
                    contact interactions that partially swap spin states with
                    those of their neighbors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The encoded silicon/silicon germanium quantum dot
                    qubits use three electron spins and a control scheme whereby
                    voltages applied to metal gates partially swap the
                    directions of those electron-spins without ever aligning
                    them in any particular direction. The demonstration involved
                    applying thousands of these precisely calibrated voltage
                    pulses in strict relation to one another over the course of
                    a few millionths of a second.

                    The quantum coherence offered by the isotopically enriched

                    of partial swap operations, and the configurable
                    insensitivity of the encoding to certain error sources
                    combine to offer a strong pathway toward scalable fault
                    tolerance and computational advantage, major steps toward a

                    process data — for that, a detailed "circuit map" of the
                    brain is needed.

                    Now, scientists have created just such a map for the most
                    advanced creature yet: a fruit fly larva. Called a
                    connectome, it diagrams the insect's 3016 neurons and
                    548,000 synapses,

                    has reported. The map will help researchers study better
                    understand how the brains of both insects and animals
                    control behavior, learning, body functions and more. The
                    work may even inspired improved AI networks.

                    annelid, all of which have several hundred neurons," said
                    professor Marta Zlatic from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular
                    Biology. "This means neuroscience has been mostly operating
                    without circuit maps. Without knowing the structure of a
                    brain, we're guessing on the way computations are
                    implemented. But now, we can start gaining a mechanistic
                    understanding of how the brain works."

                  <p>
                    [...] As a next step, the team will investigate the
                    structures used for behavioural functions like learning and
                    decision making, and examine connectome activity while the
                    insect does specific activities. And while a fruit fly larva
                    is a simple insect, the researchers expect to see similar
                    patterns in other animals. "In the same way that genes are
                    conserved across the animal kingdom, I think that the basic
                    circuit motifs that implement these fundamental behaviours
                    will also be conserved," said Zlatic.

                    I think there are more systems today that are designed with
                    far more memory and processing power than is necessary to
                    get the job done. To some degree, the push for IoT and edge
                    devices has driven a new level of complexity into embedded
                    systems that were once optimized for cost and performance.
                    In addition, connectivity and the need to potentially add
                    new features to a product for a decade or more into the
                    future are leading developers to overestimate their needs
                    and overengineer their systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While leaving extra headroom in a system for future
                    expansion is always a great idea, I've seen the extras
                    recently move into the excess. It's not uncommon for me to
                    encounter a team without understanding their system's
                    performance or software requirements. Yet, they've already
                    selected the most cutting-edge microcontroller they can
                    find. When asked about their part selection based on
                    requirements, I've heard multiple times, "We don't know, so
                    we picked the biggest part we could find just in case".
                    Folks, that's not engineering; that's design by fear!

                    [...] To that end, LeBlanc suggests a couple of changes.
                    First, there's the court order requirement. Then Congress
                    could limit the NSA's haystack-building apparatus by ending
                    its "about" variables, which allow it to also search for
                    communications that merely <em>mention</em> certain
                    individuals, rather than limiting collection to those
                    actually communicating with the agency's targets. Finally,
                    Congress should act to limit or forbid "batch searches" of
                    702 collections by the FBI, preventing it from

                    If anyone can get this done, it's Congressional leaders
                    motivated by personal animus and political grandstanding. An
                    entire party is, at the moment, extremely angry at the FBI.
                    Blatant self-interest may finally achieve what privacy
                    advocates and activists have been seeking for several years.
                    If the ends are going to justify the means, it may as well
                    be these ends and those means. Some concern for the little
                    people would be nice, but as an advocate of restricted
                    surveillance powers, I'm willing to take what I can get.

                    Block-Lite is a small concrete manufacturer in an industrial
                    corridor of Flagstaff, Arizona. The third-generation family
                    business makes bricks and other masonry materials for
                    retaining walls, driveways, and landscaping projects. The
                    company was already a local leader in sustainability — in
                    2020, it became the first manufacturer in Flagstaff to power
                    its operations with on-site solar panels. But now it's doing
                    something much more ambitious.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Tuesday, Block-Lite announced a pioneering collaboration
                    with climate tech startups Aircapture and CarbonBuilt to
                    suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stash it in
                    concrete blocks. The companies estimate the project will
                    reduce the carbon footprint of Block-Lite's products by 70
                    percent, creating a model they hope could reshape the
                    industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] CarbonBuilt has developed a solution that addresses
                    the issue in two distinct ways. First, the company found a
                    proprietary way to replace cement with a mix of inexpensive,
                    locally-sourced industrial waste materials. CEO Rahul
                    Shendure told Grist they include common byproducts of coal
                    plants, steelmaking, and chemical production that would, for
                    the most part, otherwise be destined for landfills. The
                    company's second feat is the way its equipment hardens that
                    slurry into concrete blocks — by curing it with carbon
                    dioxide. That's where Aircapture comes in. The company will
                    build one of its machines which extract carbon dioxide from
                    the ambient air directly on Block-Lite's site.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Block-Lite did not respond to Grist's inquiry, but in
                    a

                      >press release</a
                    >, the company suggested that the new concrete products
                    would be no costlier than its current offerings. "All too
                    often sustainable building materials require a trade off
                    between cost and performance, but what is unique about this
                    project is that there's no 'green premium.'" Block-Lite
                    said. "We're going to be able to produce on-spec, ultra-low
                    carbon blocks at price parity with traditional blocks which
                    should speed adoption and impact."

                    [...] In experiments, these lasers blast their target
                    materials into a high-energy state of matter known as
                    plasma. In gases, solids, and liquids, electrons are usually
                    locked tight to their atoms' nuclei, but in plasma they roam
                    freely. The plasmas throw out electromagnetic radiation,
                    such as flashes of light and x-rays, and particles like
                    electrons and neutrons. The lasers therefore also need
                    detection equipment that can record when and where these
                    events happen. These measurements then allow scientists to
                    extrapolate how a full warhead might behave.

                    since at least the 1970s. At first they combined them with
                    underground tests of actual weapons, using data from both to
                    build theoretical models of how plasma behaves. But after
                    the US stopped live-testing nuclear weapons in 1992 while
                    seeking agreement on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
                    Treaty, it switched to "science-based stockpile
                    stewardship"—namely, using supercomputer simulations of
                    warheads detonating to assess their safety and reliability.

                  <p>
                    But the US and other countries following this approach still
                    needed to physically test some nuclear materials, with
                    lasers, to ensure their models and simulations matched
                    reality and that their nukes were holding up. And they still
                    need to do this today.

                    [...] But Tikhonchuk [emeritus professor at the Center for
                    Intense Lasers and Applications at the University of
                    Bordeaux, France] believes that Russia will struggle now
                    because it has lost much of the expertise needed, with
                    scientists moving overseas. He notes that the <a

                    are very large, at 40 centimeters across, which poses a
                    significant challenge for making their lenses. The larger
                    the lens, the greater the chance there will be a defect in
                    it. Defects can concentrate energy, heating up and damaging
                    or destroying the lenses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fact that Russia is developing the Tsar Laser indicates
                    it wants to maintain its nuclear stockpile, says Lewis.
                    "It's a sign that they plan for these things to be around
                    for a long time, which is not great." But if the laser is
                    completed, he sees a sliver of hope in Russia's move. "I'm
                    quite worried that the US, Russia, and China are going to
                    resume explosive testing." The Tsar Laser investment might
                    instead show that Russia thinks it already has enough data
                    from explosive nuclear tests, he says.

                    Same-sex reproduction has historically required donor cells,
                    as is the case with egg implantation and some instances of
                    in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Thanks to genetic engineering,
                    however, this might not always be the case. Scientists in
                    Japan have successfully created eggs using male cells,
                    resulting in the birth of several mice that were produced
                    without mothers.

                    Renowned Kyushu University stem cell researcher Katshuhiko
                    Hayashi presented his team's achievement this week at the
                    Third International Summit on Human Genome Editing in
                    London. Hayashi had led his colleagues through
                    "reprogramming" a male mouse's skin cells into induced
                    pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, or former non-reproductive
                    cells that can be engineered into various cell forms.
                    Because male cells contain the XY chromosome combination,
                    Hayashi had to remove the Y chromosome and replace it with
                    an X chromosome from another cell. (Hayashi's team attempted
                    to devise a way to duplicate the first cell's X chromosome
                    but was unsuccessful, resulting in the need to pull from a
                    donor.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hayashi implanted the makeshift eggs inside a mouse ovary
                    organoid, a ball of tissues that function similarly to a
                    natural ovary. After fertilizing the eggs with sperm, his
                    team implanted the resulting 600 embryos into surrogate
                    mice. Seven of these embryos became mouse pups, which grew
                    into adults with normal lifespans and successful mating
                    routines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Should Hayashi and his colleagues successfully produce eggs
                    in the lab, it could pave the way for novel infertility
                    treatments and for same-sex procreation that incorporates
                    both partners' genes.

                  <p>
                    Welcome to the 2022 SSD Edition of the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/category/cloud-storage/hard-drive-stats/"
                      >Backblaze Drive Stats series</a
                    >. The SSD Edition focuses on the solid state drives (SSDs)
                    we use as boot drives for the data storage servers in our
                    cloud storage platform. This is opposed to our traditional
                    Drive Stats reports which focus on our hard disk drives
                    (HDDs) used to store customer data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We started using SSDs as boot drives beginning in Q4 of
                    2018. Since that time, all new storage servers and any with
                    failed HDD boot drives have had SSDs installed. Boot drives
                    in our environment do much more than boot the storage
                    servers. Each day they also read, write, and delete log
                    files and temporary files produced by the storage server
                    itself. The workload is similar across all the SSDs included
                    in this report.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this report, we look at the failure rates of the SSDs
                    that we use in our storage servers for 2022, for the last 3
                    years, and for the lifetime of the SSDs. In addition, we
                    take our first look at the temperature of our SSDs for 2022,
                    and we compare SSD and HDD temperatures to see if SSDs
                    really do run cooler.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As of December 31, 2022, there were 2,906 SSDs being used as
                    boot drives in our storage servers. There were 13 different
                    models in use, most of which are considered consumer grade
                    SSDs, and we'll touch on why we use consumer grade SSDs a
                    little later. In this report, we'll show the Annualized
                    Failure Rate (AFR) for these drive models over various
                    periods of time, making observations and providing caveats
                    to help interpret the data presented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The dataset on which this report is based is available for
                    download on our
                    <a
                      href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html"

                    >
                    webpage. The SSD data is combined with the HDD data in the
                    same files. Unfortunately, the data itself does not
                    distinguish between SSD and HDD drive types, so you have to
                    use the model field to make that distinction. If you are
                    just looking for SSD data, start with Q4 2018 and go
                    forward.

                    Whether you are making your way through a crowded pedestrian
                    zone or striving towards the goal in a team game, in both
                    situations it is important to think not only about your own
                    movements but also those of others. These navigation and
                    orientation processes are carried out by brain cells that
                    register our current position, where we are coming from,
                    where we are moving towards and in which direction we are
                    looking. Through their joint activity, they create a "map"
                    of our surroundings. A special type of these cells are the
                    so-called grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, a small brain
                    region in the middle temporal lobe. They function like the
                    brain's own GPS, because they not only represent our
                    position in space, but can also put it in relation to other
                    points in the same space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] They found that the brain activity recorded while
                    watching others was comparable to the activity of grid
                    cells. In addition, the team was able to show that this
                    activity was part of a larger network of brain regions that
                    are associated with navigation processes. Interestingly,
                    however, it turned out that the better a subject was at
                    following the path of others, the less active this network
                    was. "We interpret this as greater efficiency of the grid
                    cells, which might make it less necessary to engage the
                    larger brain network," Wagner explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results of the study thus suggest that grid cells belong
                    to a larger network of brain regions that, among other
                    aspects, coordinates navigation processes. However, this
                    network is particularly affected by ageing processes and
                    especially by dementia. Wagner explains: "The function of
                    grid cells decreases with age and dementia. As a result,
                    people can no longer find their way around and their
                    orientation is impaired." The group's further research is
                    now dedicated to the question of whether grid cells are also
                    involved in recognising other people - an aspect that is
                    often impaired in advanced dementia.

                    The havoc wreaked by wildfires isn't just on the ground.
                    Researchers at MIT have found that wildfire smoke particles
                    actively erode Earth's protective ozone layer, thus widening
                    the gap we've been spending the last decade trying to close.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When something burns and produces smoke, those smoke
                    particles—otherwise called wildfire aerosol—can drift into
                    the stratosphere, where they hang out for a year or more.
                    According to a
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05683-0"
                      >study</a

                    published Wednesday in the journal Nature, chemists and
                    atmospheric scientists have found that suspended wildfire
                    aerosol sparks chemical reactions that ultimately degrade
                    the ozone layer, or the thin atmospheric layer responsible
                    for shielding Earth from the Sun.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The newly-discovered chemical reaction increases
                    hydrochloric acid's solubility. While hydrochloric acid is
                    already present in the atmosphere, MIT found that larger
                    hydrochloric acid quantities activate chlorine in the air
                    and increase ozone loss rates when warmer temperatures
                    strike. This spells danger for the storied hole in the ozone
                    layer, which environmental activists, scientists, and
                    policymakers have been fighting to shrink for several years.

                    peaked. That said, it's difficult to know right now whether
                    these efforts are enough to compensate for the ozone damage

                has a story about a Python compiler called Codon that turns
                Python code into native machine code without a runtime

                    Python is among the one of the most popular programming
                    languages, yet it's generally not the first choice when
                    speed is required.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Typical speedups over Python are on the order of 10-100x or
                    more, on a single thread," the Codon repo
                    <a href="https://github.com/exaloop/codon">declares</a>.
                    "Codon's performance is typically on par with (and sometimes
                    better than) that of C/C++."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Unlike other performance-oriented Python implementations
                    (such as PyPy or Numba), Codon is built from the ground up
                    as a standalone system that compiles ahead-of-time to a
                    static executable and is not tied to an existing Python
                    runtime (e.g., CPython or RPython) for execution," the

                    >
                    says. "As a result, Codon can achieve better performance and
                    overcome runtime-specific issues such as the global
                    interpreter lock."

                    We need a python code that works with codon. It takes some
                    porting. We have to give types. It is a lot like C++ in this
                    regard.

                when it emerged that the company's connected car service refused
                to help track a stolen car—with a 2-year-old child still on
                board—until someone paid to reactivate the service. Now, the
                automaker says it's very sorry this happened, and it's making
                its connected vehicle emergency service free to most model-year
                2020-2023 Volkswagens.<br />[...]<br />Most MY2020 or newer VWs

                    As Lake County deputies desperately tried to find a stolen
                    Volkswagen with a toddler still inside, they reached out to
                    Car-Net, a service that lets VW owners track their vehicles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the Car-Net trial period had ended, and a representative
                    wanted $150 to restart the service and locate the SUV.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The detective pleaded, explaining the "extremely exigent
                    circumstance," but the representative didn't budge, saying
                    it was company policy, sheriff's office Deputy Chief
                    Christopher Covelli said Friday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The detective had to work out getting a credit card number
                    and then call the representative back to pay the $150 and at
                    that time the representative provided the GPS location of
                    the vehicle," Covelli said.

                A new study suggests that too much – or too little – office

                    Choosing to work in the murmur of a busy coffee shop rather
                    than in an office with library-level silence might be
                    healthier, according to a new study by researchers at the
                    University of Arizona and University of Kansas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study finds – perhaps unsurprisingly – that loud noises
                    at the office have a negative impact on employee well-being.
                    But the study also suggests that complete silence is not
                    conducive to a healthy workplace.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Everybody knows that loud noise is stressful, and, in
                    fact, extremely loud noise is harmful to your ear," said
                    study co-author Esther Sternberg, director of the UArizona
                    Institute on Place, Wellbeing &amp; Performance. "But what
                    was new about this is that with even low levels of sound –
                    less than 50 decibels – the stress response is higher."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Humans' tendency to get distracted, Sternberg said, is
                    a result of the brain's stress response to potential
                    threats. Our brains are "difference detectors" that take
                    note of sudden changes in sounds so we can decide to fight
                    or flee, she said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That may explain why low, steady sounds help mask
                    distractions in the workplace, she added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "People are always working in coffee shops – those are not
                    quiet spaces. But the reason you can concentrate there is
                    because the sounds all merge to become background noise,"
                    Sternberg said. "It masks sound that might be distracting.
                    If you hear a pin drop when it's very, very quiet, it will
                    distract you from what you're doing."

                    While the parallel port is now safely buried in the grave of
                    obsolescence, it may seem odd that the humble, slow serial
                    port is still around. But as it turns out, bit-by-bit, this
                    humble communications port has become essential.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Serial ports are slow with the standard speed at the
                    high end of the range coming in at a pedestrian 115.2Kbps.
                    At that speed, it would take you almost a day to transfer
                    1GB of data! That's under ideal circumstances, and things
                    can be much, much slower than that.

                    If we have USB, and serial ports are so slow and
                    comparatively bulky, why the heck do some computers still
                    have them? There are a few reasons, but the most important
                    ones include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Lots, and lots, of industrial and scientific equipment are
                      still in service and use serial ports to interface.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It's simple, reliable, well understood, and much cheaper
                      to implement than other more modern port types.

                Do you still use the serial port, or do you depend on equipment
                that does? I have noticed that it is still widely used in
                medical equipment but are there other fields in which the serial
                port is the standard interface?

                Last week, Denmark has stored the first volumes of carbon
                dioxide in an old oil and gas field in the Danish North Sea. The
                carbon dioxide sequestered comes from a chemical production
                plant (Ineos Oxide) in the Port of Antwerp, Belgium.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since 2010, Ineos Oxide has captured CO2 as a by-product from
                its ethylene oxide (plastics) production, cooled it down to a
                liquid, and resold the product to the food (fizzy drinks, beer)
                and agricultural (greenhouse cultivation) industry. Now,
                instead, part of this production was transported to Nini, a
                previously abandoned oil platform about 200 km in front of the
                Danish coast, and injected 1,800 meters deep.
              </p>
              <p>
                The test project, named
                <a href="https://www.projectgreensand.com/en">Greensand</a>,
                needs to prove that the process is possible, and safe. The
                modified transport vessel used, Aurora Storm, can only take 800
                ton CO2 per traject; it will have to shuttle back and forth
                between Antwerp and Denmark about 20 times, enough for 15,000

                By 2030, 8 million ton a year is planned, or about half the
                carbon dioxide emitted by Antwerp's chemical cluster, the
                largest in Europe. This, however, requires investments in new

                    our initiative to require all developers who contribute code
                    on GitHub.com to enable one or more forms of two-factor

                    GitHub is central to the software supply chain, and securing
                    the software supply chain starts with the developer. Our 2FA
                    initiative is part of a platform-wide effort to secure
                    software development by improving account security.
                    Developers' accounts are frequent targets for social
                    engineering and account takeover (ATO). Protecting
                    developers and consumers of the open source ecosystem from
                    these types of attacks is the first and most critical step
                    toward

                    [...] If your account is selected for enrollment, you will
                    be notified via email and see a banner on GitHub.com, asking
                    you to enroll. You'll have 45 days to configure 2FA on your
                    account—before that date nothing will change about using
                    GitHub except for the reminders. We'll let you know when
                    your enablement deadline is getting close, and once it has
                    passed you will be required to enable 2FA the first time you
                    access GitHub.com. You'll have the ability to snooze this
                    notification for up to a week, but after that your ability
                    to access your account will be limited.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, what if you're not in an early enrollment group but you
                    want to get started?
