                  <p>
                    California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill that
                    requires automakers selling internet-connected cars to do
                    more to protect domestic abuse survivors, a move that may
                    expand such safeguards nationwide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As automakers add ever more sophisticated technology to
                    their cars, instances of stalking and harassment using
                    features such as location tracking and remote controls have
                    begun to emerge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The bill passed the California state legislature with
                    overwhelming support, and Newsom signed it on Friday along
                    with several other measures intended to protect domestic
                    violence survivors. The law could lead to the new standards
                    being implemented beyond California, as automakers tend to
                    avoid producing different cars for different states.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Legislative analysts cited reporting from Reuters and the
                    New York Times about carmakers which did not help women who
                    alleged they were being targeted by their partners. One
                    woman unsuccessfully sued Tesla, alleging the company failed
                    to act after she repeatedly complained that her husband was
                    stalking and harassing her with the automaker's technology
                    despite a restraining order.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among its provisions, the California bill requires
                    automakers to set up a clear process for drivers to submit a
                    copy of a restraining order or other documentation and
                    request termination of another driver's remote access within
                    two business days. It also mandates that carmakers enable
                    drivers to easily turn off location access from inside the
                    vehicle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No carmaker officially opposed the law. The Alliance for
                    Automotive Innovation, which counts several car
                    manufacturers as members, said it supports the goal of
                    protecting victims of domestic abuse. The Alliance raised
                    some concerns about technical feasibility during the
                    legislative process, and a spokesman said in an email on
                    Monday it has discussed ways to potentially address those
                    issues next year.

                While Perfctl and some of the malware it installs are detected
                by some antivirus software, Aqua Security researchers were
                unable to find any research reports on the malware. They were,
                however, able to find a wealth of threads on developer-related
                sites that discussed infections consistent with it.

                    posted to the CentOS subreddit is typical. An admin noticed
                    that two servers were infected with a cryptocurrency
                    hijacker with the names perfcc and perfctl. The admin wanted
                    help investigating the cause.

                    "I only became aware of the malware because my monitoring
                    setup alerted me to 100% CPU utilization," the admin wrote
                    in the April 2023 post. "However, the process would stop
                    immediately when I logged in via SSH or console. As soon as
                    I logged out, the malware would resume running within a few
                    seconds or minutes." The admin continued:

                        malware always manages to restart once I log out. I have
                        also searched the entire system for the string "perfcc"
                        and found the files listed below. However, removing them

                    After exploiting a vulnerability or misconfiguration, the
                    exploit code downloads the main payload from a server,
                    which, in most cases, has been hacked by the attacker and
                    converted into a channel for distributing the malware
                    anonymously. An attack that targeted the researchers'
                    honeypot named the payload httpd. Once executed, the file
                    copies itself from memory to a new location in the /temp
                    directory, runs it, and then terminates the original process
                    and deletes the downloaded binary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once moved to the /tmp directory, the file executes under a
                    different name, which mimics the name of a known Linux
                    process. The file hosted on the honeypot was named sh. From
                    there, the file establishes a local command-and-control
                    process and attempts to gain root system rights by
                    exploiting CVE-2021-4043, a privilege-escalation
                    vulnerability that was patched in 2021 in Gpac, a widely
                    used open source multimedia framework.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The malware goes on to copy itself from memory to a handful
                    of other disk locations, once again using names that appear
                    as routine system files. The malware then drops a rootkit, a
                    host of popular Linux utilities that have been modified to
                    serve as rootkits, and the miner. In some cases, the malware
                    also installs software for "proxy-jacking," the term for
                    surreptitiously routing traffic through the infected machine
                    so the true origin of the data isn't revealed.
                  </p>
                  <p>The researchers continued:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        As part of its command-and-control operation, the
                        malware opens a Unix socket, creates two directories
                        under the /tmp directory, and stores data there that
                        influences its operation. This data includes host
                        events, locations of the copies of itself, process
                        names, communication logs, tokens, and additional log
                        information. Additionally, the malware uses environment
                        variables to store data that further affects its
                        execution and behavior.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        All the binaries are packed, stripped, and encrypted,
                        indicating significant efforts to bypass defense
                        mechanisms and hinder reverse engineering attempts. The
                        malware also uses advanced evasion techniques, such as
                        suspending its activity when it detects a new user in
                        the btmp or utmp files and terminating any competing
                        malware to maintain control over the infected system.

                    In addition to new funding sources and deployment
                    strategies, the study uncovered overlooked challenges that
                    aren't being widely addressed. Many early GenAI efforts
                    failed due to issues with data quality and the processes
                    used for model training and tuning – topics directly related
                    to provenance (determining the source and characteristics of
                    the model and data) and governance (procedures to ensure
                    output quality and mitigate potential risks).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among medium-sized businesses, a staggering 84% reported
                    having no provenance policies, and 64% lacked governance
                    policies. Large enterprises fared better, but even there,
                    about a quarter had no provenance policies, and a fifth had
                    no governance procedures. (See "<a
                      href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/two-words-critical-genais-future-bob-o-donnell-bhapc/"
                      >Two Words That Are Critical to GenAI's Future</a
                    >" for more on provenance and governance.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The number one benefit that organizations hope to get from
                    their GenAI initiatives is increased efficiency and
                    productivity followed by improved quality and accuracy of
                    output.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While some of the study's findings were surprising, others
                    confirmed what many in the industry have been thinking. The
                    number one benefit that organizations hope to get from their
                    GenAI initiatives, for example, is increased efficiency and
                    productivity followed by improved quality and accuracy of
                    output.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When asked to the rank the importance of the potential
                    outcomes of their GenAI efforts, however, the results showed
                    more pragmatic, measurable results. Most importantly,
                    companies said they wanted to create new products or
                    services with the help of GenAI, and reducing costs was
                    their second most important outcome. Not only does this
                    reflect the fact that benefits and importance don't always
                    align when it comes to these initiatives, but it also
                    indicates that organizations recognize what GenAI can offer
                    now, yet still have more aspirational goals for the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In terms of the GenAI-powered applications that
                    organizations are using, as Figure 3 illustrates, the first
                    and third top choices are text-related with Text-Based
                    Document Creation number one and Text-based Summarization
                    number three.

                    Collaboration-based applications came in second, reflecting
                    the popularity of GenAI features such as meeting
                    summarizations, automatic note-taking, language translation,
                    and other capabilities integrated into messaging platforms.
                    Despite their heavy usage, satisfaction with collaboration
                    tools was found to be lower than with other product
                    categories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study also dives into more detailed aspects of the
                    companies' GenAI efforts, including which foundation models
                    and platforms they're using, why they chose them, techniques
                    for data preparation and model fine-tuning, the deployment
                    of GenAI applications at the edge, on PCs, and on
                    smartphones, as well as the types of partners companies are
                    working with and the specific services they need.

                  <p>
                    Finally, returning to the original theme, GenAI-powered
                    summarization and sentiment analysis of the survey
                    respondents' comments highlight that we're still in the
                    early stages of the GenAI revolution. While companies
                    expressed legitimate concerns about GenAI and its impact,
                    they also made it clear that they understand the long-term
                    potential of the technology and are eager to integrate it
                    into their organizations.

                    they have an evidence-backed concern, or are they trying to

                    Some claim to be sharing to inform people "<a

                    Over time, the opportunists may end up convincing
                    themselves. After all, they will eventually have to come to

                    that the next time you share an unfounded conspiracy theory,
                    online or offline, you could be helping an opportunist. They
                    don't buy it, so neither should you.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    Back in February, we celebrated our victory at trial in the
                    U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas
                    against patent trolls Sable IP and Sable Networks. This was
                    the culmination of nearly three years of litigation against
                    Sable, but it wasn't the end of the story.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today we're pleased to announce that the litigation against
                    Sable has finally concluded on terms that we believe send a
                    strong message to patent trolls everywhere — if you bring
                    meritless patent claims against Cloudflare, we will fight
                    back and we will win.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While Sable's technical expert tried his hardest to
                    convince the jury that various software and hardware
                    components of Cloudflare's servers constitute "line cards,"
                    his explanations defied credibility. The simple fact is that
                    Cloudflare's servers do not have line cards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ultimately, the jury understood, returning a verdict
                    that Cloudflare does not infringe claim 25 of the '919
                    patent.
                  </p>
                </div>

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    In the end, Sable agreed to pay Cloudflare $225,000, grant
                    Cloudflare a royalty-free license to its entire patent
                    portfolio, and to dedicate its patents to the public,
                    ensuring that Sable can never again assert them against
                    another company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Let's repeat that first part, just to make sure everyone
                    understands:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sable, the patent troll that sued Cloudflare back in March
                    2021 asserting around 100 claims across four patents, in the
                    end wound up paying Cloudflare. While this $225,000 can't
                    fully compensate us for the time, energy and frustration of
                    having to deal with this litigation for nearly three years,
                    it does help to even the score a bit. And we hope that it
                    sends an important message to patent trolls everywhere to
                    beware before taking on Cloudflare.

                    Officials in Ireland have fined Meta $101 million for
                    storing hundreds of millions of user passwords in plaintext
                    and making them broadly available to company employees.

                    in early 2019. The company said that apps for connecting to
                    various Meta-owned social networks had logged user passwords
                    in plaintext and stored them in a database that had been
                    searched by roughly 2,000 company engineers, who
                    collectively queried the stash more than 9 million times.<br />[...]<br />When
                    Meta disclosed the lapse in 2019, it was clear the company
                    had failed to adequately protect hundreds of millions of
                    passwords.

                    "It is widely accepted that user passwords should not be
                    stored in plaintext, considering the risks of abuse that
                    arise from persons accessing such data," Graham Doyle,
                    deputy commissioner at Ireland's Data Protection Commission,

                    subject of consideration in this case, are particularly
                    sensitive, as they would enable access to users' social
                    media accounts."<br />[...]<br />To date, the EU has fined
                    Meta more than $2.23 billion (2 billion euros) for
                    violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
                    which went into effect in 2018. That amount includes last

                    Louisiana Democratic political consultant Steven Kramer was
                    indicted in May over the robocalls. The 39-second message,
                    which told people to 'save their votes' for the November
                    presidential election, was created using a text-to-speech
                    tool called ElevenLabs. The calls were spoofed so they
                    appeared to originate from the former chairwoman of the New
                    Hampshire Democratic Party, writes
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/us/politics/biden-robocalls-steve-kramer-democratic-primary.html"

                  <p>
                    Kramer had worked for Biden's primary rival, Rep. Dean
                    Phillips, who condemned the calls. Kramer claimed that he
                    paid $500 to have the calls sent to voters as a way of
                    raising awareness about the dangers artificial intelligence
                    can pose to election campaigns, which sounds like a
                    questionable justification.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For me to do that and get $5 million worth of exposure, not
                    for me," Kramer told
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bngnTezR7s"
                      >CBS New York</a
                    >. "I kept myself anonymous so the regulations could just
                    play themselves out or begin to play themselves out. I don't
                    need to be famous. That's not my intention. My intention was
                    to make a difference."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Making a strange story even weirder, Kramer hired an actual
                    New Orleans magician named Paul Carpenter to make the
                    robocalls. Carpenter said creating the recording only took
                    about 20 minutes and cost $1, and that Kramer paid him $150
                    via Venmo. He believed what he was doing had been authorized
                    by President Biden's campaign. Carpenter's account has since
                    been shut down by ElevenLabs.

                    The FCC writes that Kramer violated the Truth in Caller ID
                    Act, which makes spoofed calls illegal when made with the
                    intent to defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything
                    of value. The FCC this year

                    controversial AI safety law known as ‘Senate Bill 1047’

                    Newsom said he that did not think this legislation would be
                    the best approach to protect the public from threats posed
                    by AI.

                    [...] Instead of SB 1047, governor Newsom announced that he

                    As a force for good, however, generative AI is being
                    deployed widely across global organizations, supporting key
                    cybersecurity functions such as threat detection and
                    response, and threat intelligence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Cybersecurity is predominantly a data science problem,"
                    said Mike Elmore, global CISO at GSK. "It's becoming
                    imperative for cyber defenders to leverage the power of
                    generative AI and machine learning to get closer to the data
                    to drive timely and actionable insights that matter the
                    most."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shockingly, PwC also found that business leaders who have
                    regulatory and legal requirements to improve security do
                    just that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Indeed, 96 percent said regulations prompted an organization
                    to improve its security, while 78 percent said the same regs
                    have challenged, improved, or increased their security
                    posture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Organizations that embrace regulatory requirements
                    tend to benefit from stronger security frameworks and a more
                    robust posture against emerging threats," read PwC's report.
                    "Compliance shouldn't be viewed as a box-ticking exercise
                    but as an opportunity to build long-term resilience and
                    trust with stakeholders."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These new regulations have also ushered in new investment
                    into cybersecurity. Roughly a third of organizations (32
                    percent) said cyber investment increased to a "large extent"
                    in the past 12 months. 37 percent said investment increased
                    to a "moderate extent," while 14 percent said the increase
                    in investment was "significant."

                    The UK's last coal plant will sigh out its final pollutants
                    Monday before shutting down for good and officially ending
                    the country's century and a half of coal production.
                    Nottinghamshire's Ratcliffe-on-Soar plant was the last of
                    its kind following

                    >
                    to close all coal power plants by 2025. Ratcliffe was
                    originally scheduled to shut down in 2022 but stayed open
                    after Russia invaded Ukraine and Europe entered a gas
                    crisis.

                  <p>
                    The Ratcliffe plant once had 3,000 engineers but only
                    employs 170 staff now. That group will gather to watch a
                    livestream of the plant being turned off, and over 100 of
                    them are set to work on decommissioning the plant over the
                    next two years. Many of the other employees will enter new
                    jobs at different power plants owned by Uniper, Raticliffe's
                    German owner, while others will enter training programs to
                    work on other aspects of the industry.

                    Britain opened the world's first coal power plant in 1882,
                    London's Holborn Viaduct, with the help of Thomas Edison's
                    Edison Electric Light Company. Coal has played a major part
                    in the UK until very recently. According to a report from
                    energy think tank
                    <a
                      href="https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/the-uks-journey-to-a-coal-power-phase-out/#supporting-material"
                      >Ember</a
                    >, coal was responsible for 39 percent of the UK's energy
                    supply in 2012 but shrunk to just two percent in 2019. The

                    was reportedly equal to double the amount of all greenhouse
                    gases used in the UK in 2023. Between 2012 and 2023,

                    and solar generation also increased from six percent to a 34
                    percent share of the UK's energy. Britain still has a long
                    way to go, but this step has made it the first G7 country to
                    remove all coal power production.

                    Although we suspect most people probably use Firefox or
                    Chrome, GNOME's Epiphany web browser has a bunch of new
                    features. Now it can do automatic form filling, has better
                    bookmarks, improvements in the handling of text boxes and
                    the address field, as well as passwords, image contrast,
                    setting wallpapers, and more. Sadly, though, support for
                    Mozilla's Firefox Sync, missing for a few releases, hasn't
                    returned yet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many more changes are under the hood and less visible –
                    unless it means improved support for kit that you use, such
                    as VR headsets, which get better Wayland support. There's
                    improved handling for graphics tablets, including
                    customizing button actions and pressure sensitivity.
                    Graphics acceleration has also improved, especially on
                    Nvidia GPUs, and there's better handling of machines with
                    hybrid graphics. Interop with X11 apps is better, with
                    drag-and-drop, improved fractional scaling – but if you're
                    one of the people who wants to banish X.org forever, GNOME
                    can now be compiled entirely without X11 support.

                    Especially now with the return of limited custom color
                    selections, and Files' expanding functionality, we sometimes
                    get the feeling that after GNOME 3 got started by removing a
                    large range of functionality, over the years since the team
                    has been gradually adding it back, piecemeal. The growing
                    functionality of some of its accessory apps also makes us
                    wonder if the project might not save itself some work by
                    cooperating more with existing external projects. However,

                    Whatever the reasons, it is the flagship desktop of most
                    Linux distributions today. It's the only choice on both SUSE
                    and Red Hat's enterprise flavors, as well as being the
                    default in Debian, Ubuntu, and many others. As such, long
                    may it grow and flourish.

                    and burned amid scrutiny from security researchers and

                    recorded screenshots and OCR text of all user activity, and
                    stored it unencrypted on disk where it could easily be

                    authorities, so probably not), but this is a clear step in
                    the direction of addressing the needs of specific customers
                    with a pre-trained model done by AMD - using AMD hardware
                    for inference.

                  <p>
                    The main reason why AMD's models are fast is because they
                    use so-called speculative decoding. Speculative decoding
                    introduces a smaller 'draft model' that generates multiple
                    candidate tokens in a single forward pass. Tokens are then
                    passed to a larger, more accurate 'target model' that
                    verifies or corrects them. On the one hand, this approach
                    allows for multiple tokens to be generated simultaneously,
                    yet on the other hand this comes at the cost of power due to
                    increased data transactions.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] AMD believes that further optimizations can lead to
                    even better performance. Yet, as the company shares
                    benchmark numbers of its previous-generation GPUs, we can
                    only imagine what its current-generation (MI300X) and
                    next-generation (MI325X) could do.

                    [PDF] filed on Wednesday reveals that Oracle held 29 percent
                    stake in Ampere as of May 31, 2024, and has the option to
                    gain majority control over the chip house in 2027.

                    "The total carrying value of our investments in Ampere,
                    after accounting for losses under the equity method of
                    accounting, was $1.5 billion as of May 31, 2024," the filing
                    reads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Oracle also revealed it extended $600 million in loans in
                    the form of convertible debt to Ampere during its 2024
                    fiscal year, on top of $400 million in debt given during the
                    prior fiscal year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ampere's debts are set to mature beginning June 2026, when
                    Oracle will have the option of converting those investments
                    into additional equity in the chip startup. "If either of
                    such options is exercised by us or our co-investors, we
                    would obtain control of Ampere and consolidate its results
                    with our results of operations," the filing explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the document, Oracle spent roughly $48 million
                    on Ampere processors during its 2023 fiscal year – some of
                    it direct with Ampere and some through a third party. By
                    comparison, Big Red spent just $3 million on Ampere's chips
                    and had $101.1 million worth of products available under a
                    pre-payment order by the end of fiscal year 2024.

                    microprocessor – and winning customers including Microsoft
                    and Google – Ampere faces growing competition not only from

                    SpaceX celebrated the first human spaceflight from its Cape
                    Canaveral launch site on Saturday, and while the two humans
                    aboard the Crew Dragon Freedom are safely on their way to
                    the International Space Station, a problem arose with the
                    rocket's second stage that prompted the company to shut down
                    future launches for now.
                  </p>

                    "After today's successful launch of Crew-9, Falcon 9's
                    second stage was disposed in the ocean as planned, but
                    experienced an off-nominal deorbit burn," SpaceX posted on
                    X. "As a result, the second stage safely landed in the
                    ocean, but outside of the targeted area. We will resume
                    launching after we better understand [the] root cause."

                  <p>
                    The first victim of the shutdown was a planned launch Sunday
                    from California of a Falcon 9 with a plan to send up the
                    OneWeb Launch 20 mission for EutelsatGroup.

                    The Federal Aviation Administration still has that launch on
                    its operations plan advisory for as early as Oct. 1, but the
                    last two times SpaceX had an "off-nominal" issue with a
                    Falcon 9 launch, the FAA had grounded the rocket.

                  <p>
                    The most recent was a fiery landing of a Falcon 9's
                    first-stage booster last month during a Starlink mission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The FAA investigates commercial space incidents to
                    determine the root cause and identify corrective actions so
                    they won't happen again," the FAA said in a statement after
                    that incident.

                    below, the colossal elliptical galaxy M87, which is shaped
                    like a giant egg, looks like "a translucent, fuzzy white
                    cotton ball," ESA explained. The jet, as you can see, is the
                    wavy blue beam blasting out from the galactic core, home to
                    the supermassive black hole (it has the mass of
                    <em>5.4 billion</em> suns).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the jet shoots through the galaxy, astronomers suspect
                    it's triggering a type of stellar explosion called a "<a
                      href="https://mashable.com/article/nova-outburst-new-star-coronae-borealis"
                      >nova</a
                    >." These eruptions happen in double-star systems with an
                    aging star — which is bloated and shedding its layers — and
                    a white

                    >-like star that has shed its mass. The swollen star dumps
                    material (hydrogen) on the white dwarf. "When the dwarf has
                    tanked up a mile-deep surface layer of hydrogen that layer
                    explodes like a giant nuclear bomb," the agency explained.
                    And then the gradual process renews.

                    imagine that space broadband players like SpaceX or Amazon

                    Elon Musk's professed fervent belief in free speech is at
                    odds with China's desire to monitor content and require

                    SESAC is nearing its end, and the two have struggled to
                    agree on a new deal. Without an agreement in place, YouTube

                    a new partnership with
                    <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/">Valve</a>, the
                    company behind the Steam gaming platform and
                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"
                      >Steam Deck</a
                    >. This collaboration will see Valve financially support two
                    major projects for Arch Linux: an improved build service
                    infrastructure and a secure signing enclave.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] By providing freelance backing, Valve's support allows
                    Arch Linux to work on these critical projects without being
                    hindered by limitations in volunteer time. This will
                    significantly accelerate progress and enable the Arch Linux
                    team to tackle ambitious endeavours that would have
                    otherwise taken much longer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The collaboration will lead to the development of a robust
                    build service infrastructure. This infrastructure will
                    involve servers for building software, potentially similar
                    to continuous integration systems. The system will likely
                    manage compiling and distributing software, simplifying the
                    process and reducing the need for custom setups for
                    different devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The introduction of a secure signing enclave marks a
                    significant advancement in security for Arch Linux. This
                    enclave will leverage code signing to provide a higher level
                    of assurance that packages downloaded from the official
                    repositories haven't been tampered with. Users will be able
                    to cryptographically verify the origin and integrity of
                    software packages, making it much harder for malicious
                    actors to distribute compromised software.

                There is speculation that Valve might publicly release SteamOS
                in the future or that native support for games on GNU/Linux will
                improve greatly.

                    There are few bigger names in the world of motorcycles than
                    Harley-Davidson. The brand has been churning out two-wheeled
                    classics left and right for over a century, cultivating a
                    fanbase like no other. Along the way,

                    arise, in addition to plenty that have fallen by the
                    wayside. Seeing as it's rarely talked about in the modern
                    era, it's no stretch to say that one of these overlooked
                    points on the Harley timeline is the brand's brief foray
                    into lawn mower technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yes, as it was making its name as one of the United States'
                    foremost motorcycle manufacturers, Harley-Davidson took a
                    detour into landscaping territory. Way back in 1929, the
                    company began providing single cylinder side-valve engines
                    for the Worthington Mower Company's Overgreen lawn mowers.
                    These massive mowers were used commercially to cut large
                    swaths of grass like golf courses. Harley's engines powered
                    them throughout the Great Depression, though the motorcycle
                    giant didn't stick with lawn mowers for the long haul. Thus,
                    it was never destined to sit alongside
                    <a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It has been nearly 100 years since Harley-Davidson's
                    Worthington collaboration came and went, yet some folks are
                    still keen on trying to power their mowers with the bike
                    favorite's technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With modern perceptions of Harley-Davidson as strictly a
                    motorcycle brand, the idea of it contributing to the
                    Worthington Mower Company's Overgreen lawn mowers sounds
                    absurd. After all, throughout its century-long history, it
                    has only branched out to create non-motorcycle products a
                    few times. For instance, it created the LR-64 drone rocket
                    engine for the U.S. military, and took a dip in the marine
                    technology pool with its purchase of the Tomahawk Boating
                    Company in 1961. Still, this hasn't prevented some folks
                    from trying to bring its modern tech to back to the realm of
                    landscaping.

                    Over on YouTube,

                      >Specialised Motorcycle Transport</a
                    >
                    showcased what a modern lawn mower could look like with a
                    Harley engine inside. It looks like a conventional riding
                    mower with some unique aesthetic touches, but sounds just
                    like motorcycle and is designed to get the speed of one too.
                    This contraption was constructed for racing purposes rather
                    than lawn maintenance.

                    on YouTube featured a similar piece on their channel. This
                    orange riding mower — dubbed the "mower cycle" — came
                    equipped with a 1,500cc Harley engine, certainly making it
                    better suited for the racetrack than for cutting grass. It
                    more than likely can't outrun

                    the dust.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Odds are Harley-Davidson's efforts in terms of lawn mowing
                    are long over, but so long as mechanics can make its engines
                    compatible with the latest riding mowers, chances are its
                    legacy in the space will endure well into the future.

                  <p>
                    Fifth, the GDPR, on principle, posits that every processing
                    of personal data restricts the data subject’s right to data
                    protection. It requires, therefore, that each of these
                    processes needs a justification based on the law. The GDPR
                    deems any processing of personal data as a potential risk
                    and forbids its processing in principle. It only allows
                    processing if a legal ground is met. Such an anti-processing
                    and anti-sharing approach may not make sense in a
                    data-driven economy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sixth, the law does not distinguish between low-risk and
                    high-risk applications by imposing the same obligations for
                    each type of data processing application, with a few
                    exceptions requiring consultation of the Data Processing
                    Administrator for high-risk applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Seventh, the GDPR also excludes exemptions for low-risk
                    processing scenarios or when SMEs, startups, non-commercial
                    entities, or private citizens are the data controllers.
                    Further, there are no exemptions or provisions that protect
                    the rights of the controller and of third parties for such
                    scenarios in which the data controller has a legitimate
                    interest in protecting business and trade secrets,
                    fulfilling confidentiality obligations, or the economic
                    interest in avoiding huge and disproportionate efforts to
                    meet GDPR obligations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eighth, the GDPR lacks a mechanism that allows SMEs and
                    startups to shift the compliance burden onto third parties,
                    which then store and process data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ninth, the GPR relies heavily on government-based
                    bureaucratic monitoring and administration of GDPR privacy
                    compliance. This means an extensive bureaucratic system is
                    needed to manage the compliance regime.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are other issues with GDPR enforcement (see pieces by

                    Hague was thrust into the commander's job for the rescue
                    mission based on his experience and handling of a launch
                    emergency six years ago. The Russian rocket failed shortly
                    after liftoff, and the capsule carrying him and a cosmonaut
                    catapulted off the top to safety.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rookie NASA astronaut Zena Cardman and veteran space flier
                    Stephanie Wilson were pulled from this flight after NASA
                    opted to go with SpaceX to bring the stuck astronauts home.
                    The space agency said both would be eligible to fly on
                    future missions. Gorbunov remained under an exchange
                    agreement between NASA and the Russian Space Agency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] SpaceX has long been the leader in NASA's commercial
                    crew program, established as the space shuttles were
                    retiring more than a decade ago. SpaceX beat Boeing in
                    delivering astronauts to the space station in 2020 and it's
                    now up to 10 crew flights for NASA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Delayed by Hurricane Helene pounding Florida, the
                    latest SpaceX liftoff marked the first for astronauts from
                    Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.
                    SpaceX took over the old Titan rocket pad nearly two decades
                    ago and used it for satellite launches, while flying crews
                    from Kennedy's former Apollo and shuttle pad next door. The
                    company wanted more flexibility as more Falcon rockets
                    soared.

                    GitHub. The Winamp for Windows project, as it's officially
                    called by Llama Group, will receive a few updates per year,
                    adding new features and ensuring proper security practices.
                    Just don't get your hopes up about creating alternative
                    projects from this "freely" available code.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Llama Group is looking to the

                      >GitHub community</a
                    >
                    for help in developing new capabilities and maintaining (or
                    even modernizing) a codebase that dates back several
                    decades. Originally introduced in 1997, Winamp has long been
                    praised for its flexibility and broad compatibility with
                    various audio formats.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Winamp's source code is now freely available, but the
                    license it was released under has sparked controversy. The
                    <a
                      href="https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp/blob/community/LICENSE.md"
                      >Winamp Collaborative License</a
                    >
                    imposes significant restrictions on what people can do with
                    the code, including a ban on releasing modified third-party
                    modified versions. The license explicitly states that no
                    public forks are permitted, and only the maintainers of the
                    official repository are allowed to release the software or
                    any new (approved) modifications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Llama Group appears eager to benefit from community
                    contributions to Winamp, but the software itself cannot be
                    repurposed to create something new. Despite the legal
                    threat, developers are undeterred, with hundreds of
                    "unofficial" forks of Winamp's source code already surfacing
                    online. As time goes on, this trend is only expected to
                    grow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Legal concerns aside, it seems clear that Llama Group no
                    longer wants the full responsibility of maintaining the
                    still-popular PC media player. The company has shifted its
                    focus to different business ventures, including

                    in Antarctica has concluded with a grim outlook on its
                    future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Often dubbed the “doomsday glacier”, this huge mass of ice
                    is comparable in size to Britain or Florida and its collapse
                    alone would raise sea levels by 65 centimetres. Worse still,
                    this is expected to trigger a more widespread loss of the
                    ice sheet covering West Antarctica, causing a calamitous sea
                    level rise of 3.3 metres and threatening cities like New
                    York, Kolkata and Shanghai.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is an extremely remote and difficult area to get to, but
                    the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC), a
                    joint UK-US research programme, has managed to deploy 100
                    scientists there over the past six years, using planes,
                    ships and underwater robots to study the dynamics of this
                    ice in detail.  “It was a tremendous challenge, and yet we
                    really learned a lot,” says
                    <a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/people/ted-scambos"
                      >Ted Scambos</a

                    at University of Colorado Boulder.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These discoveries include the fact that Thwaites glacier is
                    particularly vulnerable, as it rests on a bed of rock that
                    is well below sea level and is being melted from the
                    underside by warmer seawater. What’s more, the bedrock
                    slopes downwards towards the interior of the ice sheet, so,
                    as the glacier retreats, even more ice is exposed to warm
                    seawater, threatening to accelerate the collapse.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “It’s not going to instantaneously lead to a
                    catastrophic retreat in the next year or the year after,
                    but, at the same time, we are very sure that Thwaites is
                    going to continue to retreat, and ultimately the retreat is
                    going to accelerate,” says
                    <a href="https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/rdla/">Rob Larter</a>
                    at the British Antarctic Survey, another member of the team.
                    “We can’t put an exact time frame on that.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, however, the ITCG researchers think that, by the
                    end of the 23<sup>rd</sup> century, Thwaites glacier and
                    much of the West Antarctic ice sheet might be lost.

                  <p>
                    On Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman outlined his vision for an
                    AI-driven future of tech progress and global prosperity in a
                    new personal blog post titled "<a
                      href="https://ia.samaltman.com/"
                      >The Intelligence Age.</a
                    >" The essay paints a picture of human advancement
                    accelerated by AI, with Altman suggesting that
                    superintelligent AI could emerge within the next decade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few
                    thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I'm confident
                    we'll get there," he wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    OpenAI's current goal is to

                    >
                    (artificial general intelligence), which is a term for
                    hypothetical technology that could match human intelligence
                    in performing many tasks without the need for specific
                    training. By contrast, superintelligence surpasses AGI, and
                    it could be seen as a hypothetical level of machine
                    intelligence that can dramatically outperform humans at any
                    intellectual task, perhaps even to an unfathomable
                    degree.<br />[...]<br />Despite the criticism, it's notable
                    when the CEO of what is probably the defining AI company of
                    the moment makes a broad prediction about future
                    capabilities—even if that means he's perpetually trying to

                    is foremost on many tech CEOs' minds these days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If we want to put AI into the hands of as many people as
                    possible," Altman writes in his essay, "we need to drive
                    down the cost of compute and make it abundant (which
                    requires lots of energy and chips). If we don't build enough
                    infrastructure, AI will be a very limited resource that wars
                    get fought over and that becomes mostly a tool for rich
                    people."<br />[...]<br />While enthusiastic about AI's
                    potential, Altman urges caution, too, but vaguely. He
                    writes, "We need to act wisely but with conviction. The dawn
                    of the Intelligence Age is a momentous development with very
                    complex and extremely high-stakes challenges. It will not be
                    an entirely positive story, but the upside is so tremendous
                    that we owe it to ourselves, and the future, to figure out
                    how to navigate the risks in front of us."<br />[...]<br />"Many
                    of the jobs we do today would have looked like trifling
                    wastes of time to people a few hundred years ago, but nobody
                    is looking back at the past, wishing they were a
                    lamplighter," he wrote. "If a lamplighter could see the
                    world today, he would think the prosperity all around him
                    was unimaginable. And if we could fast-forward a hundred
                    years from today, the prosperity all around us would feel
                    just as unimaginable."

                    If you're thinking of going down the unconventional route
                    for this year's Halloween costume, we've got just the
                    inspiration for you: a brand-new species of chimaera, better
                    known as a ghost shark or
                    <a

                  <p>
                    Scientists discovered the new species, which goes by the
                    scientific name <em>Harriotta avia</em> –
                    <em>avia</em> meaning "grandmother" in Latin, in honor of
                    study author Dr Brit Finucci's grandmother – and the common
                    name Australasian Narrow-nosed Spookfish, off the coast of
                    New Zealand and Australia.

                    – the study describing the new species dubs it "a global
                    diversity [hotspot] for chimaeroids" – but it was previously
                    thought that this particular species wasn't actually its own
                    species at all. Instead, it was believed to be a variant of
                    another species, <em>Harriotta raleighana</em>, which is
                    found across the globe.

                  <p>
                    But with the help of genetics and a closer inspection of its
                    morphology, the researchers were able to identify
                    <em>H. avia</em> as a species in its own right.

                  <p>
                    "<em>Harriotta avia</em> is unique due to its elongated,
                    narrow and depressed snout; long, slender trunk; large eyes;
                    and very long, broad pectoral fins," said Finucci in a

                    [...] "Ghost sharks like this one are largely confined to
                    the ocean floor, living in depths of up to 2,600 [meters]
                    [8530 feet]," said Finucci. The level of pressure to be

                    "Their habitat makes them hard to study and monitor, meaning
                    we don't know a lot about their biology or threat status,
                    but it makes discoveries like this even more exciting,"
                    Finucci explained.

                    What we do know is that, despite the nickname, ghost sharks
                    aren't actually sharks at all. Whilst the two groups are
                    still related to each other, it's thought that they

                    from one another other nearly 400 million years ago. Both
                    remained cartilaginous, but ghost sharks have wound up with
                    several physical differences from their relatives.

                    This is where the trucks come in: The traffic on German
                    autobahns that most consistently conforms to that pattern
                    are the swarms of semis that are constantly crisscrossing
                    the country. "The trucks are generally limited to 80km/h
                    (50mph)," says Drive Pilot test engineer Jochen Haab," but
                    they usually travel at about 90km/h, and up to 95km/h on
                    downhills."<br />Drive Pilot 95 could operate without having
                    to follow traffic, Haab says, but making that part of its
                    operational design domain provides an additional safety
                    redundancy: If there is traffic ahead, and it is moving, the
                    car knows for certain the road ahead is clear without
                    needing to process more data to double check.<br />A highly
                    precise positioning antenna mounted in the roof enables the
                    car to know, to within a fraction of an inch, exactly where
                    it is in terms of its absolute position, its relative
                    position, and its position correlated to carefully measured
                    landmarks on an HD map built from data collected
                    Mercedes-Benz engineers who drove every single mile of

                    Ferroelectric memory (FRAM) is an interesting storage
                    technique that stores bits in a special "ferroelectric"
                    material. Ferroelectric memory is nonvolatile like flash
                    memory, able to hold its data for decades. But, unlike
                    flash, ferroelectric memory can write data rapidly.
                    Moreover, FRAM is much more durable than flash and can be be
                    written trillions of times. With these advantages, you might
                    wonder why FRAM isn't more popular. The problem is that FRAM
                    is much more expensive than flash, so it is only used in
                    niche applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The history of ferroelectric memory dates back to the
                    early 1950s.3 Many companies worked on FRAM from the 1950s
                    to the 1970s, including Bell Labs, IBM, RCA, and Ford. The
                    1955 photo below shows a 256-bit ferroelectric memory built
                    by Bell Labs. Unfortunately, ferroelectric memory had many
                    problems,4 limiting it to specialized applications, and
                    development was mostly abandoned by the 1970s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ferroelectric memory had a second chance, though. A major
                    proponent of ferroelectric memory was George Rohrer, who
                    started working on ferroelectric memory in 1968. He formed a
                    memory company, Technovation, which was unsuccessful, and
                    then cofounded Ramtron in 1984.5 Ramtron produced a tiny
                    256-bit memory chip in 1988, followed by much larger
                    memories in the 1990s.

                    "How enzymes tie a lasso knot is a fascinating question.
                    This study provides a first glimpse of the biophysical
                    interactions responsible for producing this unique
                    structure," said Diwakar Shukla, an associate professor of
                    chemical and biomolecular engineering.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We also showed that these molecular contacts are the same
                    in several different cyclases across different phyla. Even
                    though we have not tested every system, we believe it's a
                    generalizable model," Barrett said.

                  <p>
                    Collaborating with the San Diego-based company Lassogen, the
                    researchers showed that the new insights can guide cyclase
                    engineering to generate lasso peptides that otherwise cannot
                    be made. As a proof-of-concept, they engineered a different
                    cyclase, called McjC, to efficiently produce a potent
                    inhibitor of a cancer-promoting integrin.

                  <p>
                    "The ability to generate lasso peptide diversity is
                    important for optimizing drugs," said Mark Burk, CEO of
                    Lassogen. "The enzymes from nature do not always allow us to
                    produce the lasso peptides of interest and the ability to
                    engineer lasso cyclases greatly expands the therapeutic
                    utility of these amazing molecules."

                    "Our work would not have been possible without access to
                    powerful computing and recent advances in artificial
                    intelligence and cell-free biosynthetic methods," said
                    Douglas Mitchell, John and Margaret Witt Professor of
                    Chemistry. "This work is an extraordinary example of how
                    interdisciplinary collaborations are catalyzed at the Carl
                    R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology."

                    UK government IT contracts worth £23.4 billion are due to
                    end during the current five-year Parliament, according to
                    researchers who warn that poor performing suppliers are
                    hardly ever excluded from bidding again.

                    A report by public spending research company Tussell and the
                    Institute for Government found that a third of these, worth
                    £9 billion, are supposed to finish up in 2025.

                    at the center of one of the greatest miscarriages of justice
                    in the UK. From 1999 until 2015, 736 local branch managers
                    were wrongfully convicted of fraud when errors in the system
                    were to blame. The total value of the Horizon contract is
                    £2.38 billion ($3.15 billion). It is due to expire on March
                    31, 2025.

                    [...] The researchers warn that poor-performing suppliers to
                    UK government are virtually never excluded from supplying
                    the public sector and often continue to receive government
                    money. Meanwhile, a large number of contracts, totaling
                    billions of pounds, are overseen by officials who are not
                    commercial specialists.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The report also highlights that poor data across government
                    departments meant officials didn't know how much they were
                    spending and with whom. And new providers that could perhaps
                    deliver better services for less money are discouraged from
                    bidding for business.

                  <p>
                    [...] "Public procurement is a huge market hiding in plain
                    sight, accounting for approximately one-third of all public
                    spending and 10 percent of UK GDP," said Gus Tugendhat,
                    founder of Tussell.

                    "In the context of tight budgets and strained public
                    services, getting value for money out of government
                    contracts is more important than ever," he said.

                There is a fair, and long running, amount of research for that
                playing Tetris helps people deal with trauma, PTSD of some kind.
                Adding some more recent research then where it can reduce PTSD
                symptoms in healthcare workers (nurses) that worked with trauma
                COVID19 patients.

                Playing something such as Tetris (it's a bit unclear if it's
                just Tetris or a similar style of games of which Tetris is the
                prime example) can induce some relaxing zen like state or a
                "cognitive vaccine". 20 minutes is apparently the prescribed
                dosage of rotational healing experience. There was the 15
                minutes of talking to before playing Tetris. But clearly the
                healing power of Tetris at work ...

                    The study was carried out with healthcare workers in Sweden
                    who worked with COVID-19 patients and were exposed to
                    work-related trauma. It was conducted during the COVID-19
                    pandemic between September 2020 and April 2022. A total of
                    164 participants were included. Participants were recruited
                    through information at workplaces. Participation was
                    entirely voluntary. The criterion for participation was that
                    the person had at least two intrusive memories per week due
                    to traumatic events that occurred at work.

                    A truck full of lithium-ion batteries is burning in Los
                    Angeles, shutting down ports and a bridge. It’s not clear

                    Bridge, leading to the Port of Los Angeles and the next-door
                    Port of Long Beach, has been shut down for at least 15 hours
                    now while local firefighters let the truck burn. State Route
                    47 was also closed in both directions as of a couple of

                    burn. As of 12:10PM PT on Friday, the truck was still on
                    fire, and both the ports and bridge were still closed, Los

                    >, big concentrated lithium battery fires can be very
                    difficult to put out: firefighters sometimes douse them with
                    thousands of gallons of water only to see the fire restart
                    as additional battery cells heat up to the point that they
                    combust. Once a cell gets hot enough, it’s said to go into
                    “thermal runaway,” at which point it can sometimes restart a
                    fire. The LAFD confirms this is a case of thermal runaway.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    EV packs are particularly dense with cells, but we don’t yet
                    know if they were involved here — the LA Fire Department
                    spokesperson says it’s not clear who owns the truck, let
                    alone what it was carrying. The LAFD could only confirm they
                    are lithium-ion batteries at this point.

                Computing Community. Plus analyst Lawrence Hecht, who concluded
                "these companies are nowhere closer to being profitable than
                before."
              </p>
              <p>
                There's new quotes from the analyst herself. ("I asked Stephens
                if she thought the analysis would have an impact in the future
                on companies considering moves to proprietary licensing. 'I
                doubt it,' Stephens replied...") And Hecht pounds away at the
                missteps. ("The assumption has been that closing a company's
                license will allow the companies to increase their margins among
                their existing customers... The percentage of companies using a
                given technology is not changing... Elasticsearch fell from 14%
                to 13%..")
              </p>
              <p>
                Interestingly, the study hits right as Elastic is switching
                *back* to an open-source license. They weigh in in this article
                too...
              </p>
              <p>
                It's the discussion about open source licensing that really
                needed to happen.

                    CPU is incredibly primitive by modern standards. And it's
                    slow—it takes about 4.76 days for the Linux kernel to boot.

                    raw 4004, you're right: The 4004 itself is far too limited
                    to run Linux directly. Instead, Grinberg created a solution
                    that is equally impressive: an emulator that runs on the
                    4004 and emulates a MIPS R3000 processor—the architecture

                    In a study published July 29 in
                    <a

                      ><i>Advanced Materials</i></a
                    >, University of Texas at Dallas researchers found that
                    X-rays of the kidneys using gold nanoparticles as a contrast
                    agent might be more accurate in detecting kidney disease
                    than standard laboratory blood tests. Based on their study
                    in mice, they also found that caution may be warranted in
                    employing renal-clearable nanomedicines to patients with
                    compromised kidneys.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before administering renal-clearable drugs, doctors
                    routinely check a patient's kidney function by testing their
                    blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels. With
                    the increasing use of engineered nanoparticles to deliver
                    payloads of drugs or imaging agents to the body, an
                    important question is how the nanoparticles' movement and
                    elimination through the kidney is affected by kidney damage.
                    Can traditional biomarkers like BUN and Cr accurately
                    predict how well—or how poorly—such nanoparticles will move
                    through the kidneys?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The UT Dallas researchers found that in mice with severely
                    injured kidneys caused by the drug cisplatin, in which BUN
                    and Cr levels were 10 times normal, nanoparticle transport
                    through the kidneys was slowed down significantly, a
                    situation that caused the nanoparticles to stay in the
                    kidneys longer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In mildly injured kidneys, however, in which BUN and Cr
                    levels were only four to five times higher than normal, the
                    transport and retention of gold nanoparticles couldn't be
                    predicted by those tests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the other hand, the amount of gold nanoparticle
                    accumulation seen on X-rays did correlate strongly with the
                    degree of kidney damage.

                    "While our findings emphasize the need for caution when
                    using these advanced treatments in patients with compromised
                    kidneys, they also highlight the potential of gold
                    nanoparticles as a noninvasive way to assess kidney injuries
                    using X-ray imaging or other techniques that correlate with
                    gold accumulation in the kidneys," said Dr. Mengxiao Yu, a

                    When security researcher Johann Rehberger recently reported
                    a vulnerability in ChatGPT that allowed attackers to store
                    false information and malicious instructions in a user's
                    long-term memory settings, OpenAI summarily closed the
                    inquiry, labeling the flaw a safety issue, not, technically
                    speaking, a security concern.

                    exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. OpenAI engineers
                    took notice and issued a partial fix earlier this month.

                    Two of the world's satellite positioning service
                    constellations reached important milestones this week, after
                    the European Space Agency and China's Satellite Navigation
                    Office each launched its own pair of satellites.

                    Europe's sats were carried by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that
                    left Florida's Kennedy Space Center on September 18. A day
                    later, China's birds rode a Long March 3B that launched from
                    the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan province.

                  <p>
                    China's sats were the 63rd and 64th members of its Beidou
                    constellation, which currently has 50 operating satellites.

                    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
                    the federal body that sets technology standards for
                    governmental agencies, standards organizations, and private
                    companies, has proposed barring some of the most vexing and
                    nonsensical password requirements. Chief among them:
                    mandatory resets, required or restricted use of certain
                    characters, and the use of security questions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Choosing strong passwords and storing them safely is one of
                    the most challenging parts of a good cybersecurity regimen.
                    More challenging still is complying with password rules
                    imposed by employers, federal agencies, and providers of
                    online services. Frequently, the rules—ostensibly to enhance
                    security hygiene—actually undermine it. And yet, the
                    nameless rulemakers impose the requirements anyway.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A section devoted to passwords injects a large helping
                    of badly needed common sense practices that challenge common
                    policies. An example: The new rules bar the requirement that
                    end users periodically change their passwords. This
                    requirement came into being decades ago when password
                    security was poorly understood, and it was common for people
                    to choose common names, dictionary words, and other secrets
                    that were easily guessed.

                Keeping up with the latest in hardware is hard, and in the early
                turn of the century there was a new technology in every magazine

                Today, we've hit some fatigue and just don't keep up as much.
                Right? :-) Anyway, while most of us have heard of Dell's (and
                Lenovo's) proposal for CAMM modules to replace the multi-stick
                SO-DIMM sockets, servers are getting a new standard, too:
                M(C)RDIMMs -- Multiplexed (Combined) Rank Dual Inline Memory
                Modules.

                    By implementing DDR5 physical and electrical standards,
                    MRDIMM technology delivers a memory advancement that allows
                    scaling of both bandwidth and capacity per core to
                    future-proof compute systems and meets the expanding demands
                    of data center workloads. MRDIMMs provide the following
                    advantages over RDIMMs: 2
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Up to 39% increase in effective memory bandwidth2</li>
                    <li>Greater than 15% better bus efficiency2</li>
                    <li>Up to 40% latency improvements compared to RDIMMs3</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    MRDIMMs support a wide capacity range from 32GB to 256GB in
                    standard and tall form factors (TFF), which are suitable for
                    high-performance 1U and 2U servers. The improved thermal
                    design of TFF modules reduces DRAM temperatures by up to 20
                    degrees Celsius at the same power and airflow, [...]
                    enabling more efficient cooling capabilities in data centers
                    and optimizing total system task energy for memory-intensive
                    workloads. Micron's industry-leading memory design and
                    process technology using 32Gb DRAM die enables 256GB TFF
                    MRDIMMs to have the same power envelope as 128GB TFF MRDIMMs
                    using 16Gb die. A 256GB TFF MRDIMM provides a 35%
                    improvement in performance over similar-capacity TSV RDIMMs
                    at the maximum data rate.

                    that would require carriers to unlock all phones within 60
                    days of activation. At the time, the FCC was seeking public
                    comment on the proposal, with plans to vote on whether to
                    pursue the issue in early July. Since then, the proposal has
                    been unanimously approved by the five-member commission, and
                    the plan marches forward. To be clear, this doesn’t mean a

                  <p>
                    AT&amp;T has indicated that the rule changes could
                    negatively affect its ability to offer affordable devices,
                    though that’s about the extent of its opposition so far.
                    T-Mobile has been considerably more vocal. The “Uncarrier”
                    has not only made it clear that this change could negatively
                    impact their device payment plans and other services, but it
                    has also gone so far as to imply that the change might cause
                    the carrier to give up on payment plans altogether (as first
                    reported by B<a
                      href="https://broadbandbreakfast.com/t-mobile-unlocking-phones-after-60-days-a-major-question/"
                      ><em>roadband Breakfast</em></a
                    >). Furthermore, the carrier questions whether the FCC even
                    has the authorization to pursue such a change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] You might notice that I’ve yet to mention
                    <a
                      href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-verizon-plans-1141575/"
                      >Verizon</a
                    >, and that’s for good reason. Big Red is the only major
                    carrier vocally in support of the change. As you likely
                    guessed, the reason isn’t out of the kindness of their
                    hearts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Back in 2008, the FCC reached an agreement with Verizon
                    regarding the use of the 700MHz spectrum, with the carrier
                    agreeing to prompt device unlocks. In 2019, the FCC agreed
                    to implement a 60-day unlocking window to help Verizon
                    combat potential fraud around its payment plans and special
                    deal pricing. In other words, Verizon is already abiding by
                    this change, so it loses nothing by supporting it—in fact,
                    it might even have something to gain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Right now, many carriers, both prepaid and postpaid, offer
                    free trials through eSIM. While AT&amp;T and T-Mobile limit
                    these kinds of trials due to their current unlocking
                    policies, it’s much easier to try out a different network
                    while still keeping your Verizon phone and subscription.
                    This means a Verizon customer has a greater chance to shop
                    for other networks than those on another carrier, increasing
                    their chances of being lured away by a competitor. If all
                    carriers adhere to the same 60-day window, the playing field
                    becomes level.

                    Before Electronic Arts (EA) was the publishing juggernaut
                    that it is today, it was just one of dozens of software
                    publishers putting out titles for various home computers,
                    including the IBM PC. EA was founded in 1982 by Trip
                    Hawkins, who would go on to create the ultimately
                    unsuccessful 3DO game console. In the mid-1980's, EA was
                    perhaps most famous for their paint program, Deluxe Paint,
                    which became a popular graphics tool for the whole computer
                    gaming industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unlike the companies we have covered to date, EA is mostly
                    widely known for their games, not their copy protection
                    schemes. EA is famous enough that a long segue into their
                    corporate history isn't really necessary - you can just read
                    the Wikipedia entry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    EA wasn't selling their copy protection technology, so there
                    are no flashy advertisements extolling its virtues or many
                    articles discussing it at all. All that is left to talk
                    about is the protection itself.

                    Certificate authorities and browser makers are planning to
                    end the use of
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS">WHOIS</a> data
                    verifying domain ownership following a report that
                    demonstrated how threat actors could abuse the process to
                    obtain fraudulently issued TLS certificates.

                  <p>
                    TLS certificates are the cryptographic credentials that
                    underpin HTTPS connections, a critical component of online
                    communications verifying that a server belongs to a trusted
                    entity and encrypts all traffic passing between it and an
                    end user. These credentials are issued by any one of
                    hundreds of CAs (certificate authorities) to domain owners.
                    The rules for how certificates are issued and the process
                    for verifying the rightful owner of a domain are left to the
                    <a href="https://cabforum.org/">CA/Browser Forum</a>. One
                    "base requirement rule" allows CAs to send an email to an
                    address listed in the WHOIS record for the domain being
                    applied for. When the receiver clicks an enclosed link, the
                    certificate is automatically approved.

                    ending the reliance on WHOIS data for domain ownership
                    verification "in light of recent events where research from
                    watchTowr Labs demonstrated how threat actors could exploit
                    WHOIS to obtain fraudulently issued TLS certificates."

                    calls for reliance on WHOIS data to "sunset" in early
                    November. It establishes specifically that "CAs MUST NOT
                    rely on WHOIS to identify Domain Contacts" and that
                    "Effective November 1, 2024, validations using this [email
                    verification] method MUST NOT rely on WHOIS to identify
                    Domain Contact information."

                    the need for a change as proposed, given that the security
                    failure watchTowr uncovered is known to affect only a single

                    [...] The proposed changes are formally in the discussion
                    phase of deliberations. It's unclear when formal voting on
                    the change will begin.
