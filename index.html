                    Just when you thought it was safe to use your 12VHPWR cable
                    with your RTX 4090 again, another incident of GPU meltdown
                    pops up in the forums. Redditor Byogore reports that he
                    bought an Asus 4090 in Germany a year ago because of US
                    supply issues. The card worked totally fine until it
                    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Byogore"
                      >self-immolated</a
                    >
                    two days ago. This incident is unusual because typically
                    failures have happened much sooner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other Redditors quickly questioned whether Byogore had the
                    connectors seated securely since "user error" was one of
                    Nvidia's excuses when the issue
                    <a

                      >arose</a
                    >
                    shortly after the RTX4090 launch. Byogore defended his
                    ability to properly attach a computer component.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The fact that the 90-degree cable mod adapter [to
                    prevent bending] was plugged in fully to the connector and
                    the connector still melted, then we know that we have a
                    problem with the card. We have a problem with the card. We
                    do not have a problem with the cable. It's not user error,
                    it's not a cable not plugged in properly problem, it's not a
                    cable mod problem, but it's a problem with the design and
                    the engineering of the card."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NorthridgeFix also points out that even if the problem was
                    caused by user error, it's still Nvidia's fault. For
                    instance, if a user is plugging in a cable as they do with
                    any other, past or present, and it leaves a 1mm gap that
                    causes failure, that is not the user's fault. When there is
                    a tolerance issue like that, it is the manufacturer's
                    responsibility to fix it or design a mechanism to prevent
                    it, not blame the user for not plugging it in correctly and
                    doing nothing more about it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Byogore says that the meltdown happened while he was playing
                    Battlefield 2042. The screen turned black, but the audio
                    continued. Then, the computer rebooted itself. As it started
                    up, he could smell burnt plastic. The card still worked, but
                    only briefly before crashing and burning again. Byogore
                    mentioned that he has a 1,000W Corsair PSU and that the 4090
                    was undervolted at the time of the catastrophic failure.
                    However, he didn't note whether his PSU was ATX 3.0. The
                    problem only seems to occur on older ATX 2.0 power supplies.

                    [...] Nvidia has been reluctant to accept any blame for the
                    4090's hot-button woes. It initially blamed users for not
                    securing the cable tightly to the socket. Later, it said
                    that "<a

                    The team found that fundamental frequency differences by sex
                    increased in larger groups and those with polygynous mating
                    systems, especially in groups with a higher female-to-male
                    ratio. They reported their findings today (July 10) in
                    <em

                    [...] Deeper male voices may act as an additional way to
                    fend off mating competitors without having to engage in
                    costly fighting by making males sound bigger, in addition to
                    other physical traits like height and muscle size, according
                    to the researchers. In adult humans, for instance, males
                    vocalize at an average of 120 hertz whereas females vocalize
                    at an average of about 220 hertz, putting humans right in
                    the middle of polygynous societies, the researchers
                    reported.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Although social monogamy is really common in humans, mating
                    and reproduction in our ancestors was substantially
                    polygynous," Puts said. "Our findings help us to understand
                    why male and female voices of our species differ so
                    drastically. It may be a product of our evolutionary
                    history, particularly our history of living in large groups
                    in which some males reproduced with multiple females."

                    multiple ways to do this, such as moving some of the
                    computing into the memory itself and

                    and the like). In that scheme, the weights are encoded as
                    conductance values in a resistive memory element (RRAM). The
                    RRAM is an integral part of an analog circuit that performs
                    the key machine learning calculation, multiply and
                    accumulate. That computation is done in analog as a simple
                    summation of currents, potentially saving huge amounts of
                    power.

                    IBM’s Geoff Burr explained analog AI in depth in the

                    can tackle transformer models.

                    Another interesting AI scheme coming up at IEDM originates
                    with researchers at Tsinghua University and Peking
                    University. It’s based on a three-layer system that includes
                    a silicon CMOS logic layer, a carbon nanotube transistor and
                    RRAM layer, and another layer of RRAM made from a different
                    material. This combination, they say, solves a data transfer
                    bottleneck in many schemes that seek to lower the power and
                    latency of AI by building computing in memory. In tests it
                    performed a standard image recognition task with the similar
                    accuracy to a GPU but almost 50 times faster and with about
                    1/40th the energy.

                    Recent research has revealed that nearly half a million
                    years ago, ancient human ancestors, predating
                    <em>Homo sapiens</em>, were already engaging in advanced
                    woodworking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The artifacts found indicate that these humans were building
                    structures, potentially laying the foundation of platforms
                    or parts of dwellings, much earlier than what was once
                    believed.
                  </p>

                      >University of Liverpool</a
                    >
                    and Aberystwyth University excavated preserved wood at
                    Kalambo Falls, Zambia, dating back to an impressive 476,000
                    years. Analyzing the stone tool cut marks on the wood, the
                    team deduced that these early humans intentionally shaped
                    and combined two logs, showcasing the deliberate crafting of
                    logs to fit together. Prior to this discovery, humans were
                    believed to only utilize wood for simpler purposes such as
                    creating fire, crafting digging sticks, and making spears.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The preservation of this wood is in itself remarkable.
                    Typically, wood from such ancient times deteriorates and
                    disappears. However, at Kalambo Falls, high water levels
                    have protected and preserved these ancient wooden
                    structures.

                    These findings cast doubt on the previously held belief that
                    Stone Age humans were strictly nomadic. The abundance of
                    resources in the vicinity of Kalambo Falls suggests that
                    these ancient humans could have settled, tapping into the
                    perennial water source and the surrounding forest for
                    sustenance, allowing them to engage in construction.

                    Professor Larry Barham from the University of Liverpool
                    articulated the significance of this discovery, stating,
                    "They used their intelligence, imagination, and skills to
                    create something they'd never seen before, something that
                    had never previously existed."

                    Given the large development costs and ongoing subsidy, one
                    might start to question why Europe developed the Ariane 6 in
                    the first place. After all, the Ariane 5 has a good success
                    rate and, if it had not been retired earlier this year,
                    would be seeing significant demand on the launch market.
                    Instead, Europe has a gap in its ability to launch medium
                    and large satellites until the Ariane 6 is operationally
                    ready.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another significant downside to all of this is that Europe
                    spent a decade developing a rocket that is
                    <em>somewhat</em> more modern than the Ariane 5 but still
                    performs the same basic function at the same basic price.
                    During that lost decade, SpaceX has amply demonstrated the
                    value of re-flying first stages and has kickstarted a
                    stampede within the launch industry toward reuse. Because it
                    has been focused on the expendable Ariane 6, the European
                    Space Agency has missed out on this opportunity. It is now
                    years behind and only starting basic technology
                    demonstrations rather than bringing a true Falcon 9
                    competitor to market.

                    [...] "There is very little we can do now," Parsonson said.
                    "I know that. Ariane 6 is a pill that we're just going to
                    have to swallow. We cannot cancel the program and any new
                    development would take several years to mature. What we can
                    do, however, is make sure that ArianeGroup is not involved
                    in the future of European launch."

                    The European Space Agency's Euclid space telescope is back
                    to normal and will resume its mission, thanks to a software
                    update that was required after its navigation sensors
                    mistakenly identified solar ray signals as stars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But shortly after its instruments were deployed and it

                    a month later, mission control discovered the telescope was
                    failing to focus on stars. Squiggly lines and circles
                    captured in another image revealed that Euclid was looping
                    around and struggling to lock onto distant stars to keep it
                    steady during its observations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mission control pinpointed the issue and realized the
                    telescope's Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS), which the craft uses
                    to locate a set of landmark stars to help navigate and align
                    its instruments on designated targets, was to blame. The
                    optical sensors were mistakenly identifying photons, ejected
                    by the Sun during periods of high solar activity, as stars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The FGS analyzes light from distant sources and helps
                    control Euclid's orientation. Since it was misinterpreting
                    the solar rays as stars, the telescope was moving
                    haphazardly making it difficult to focus its sight. Working
                    together with aerospace companies Thales Alenia Space and
                    Leonardo, ESA engineers updated its software to change the
                    way its sensors characterize stars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The patch was uploaded to Euclid, and the telescope is now
                    functioning normally. Mission control will continue testing
                    its performance for a little while longer before it
                    officially begins to collect data.

                    "The performance verification phase that was interrupted in
                    August has now fully restarted and all the observations are

                    HTTP2/Rapid Reset is a novel technique for waging DDoS, or
                    distributed denial-of-service attacks, of an unprecedented
                    magnitude. It wasn’t discovered until after it was already
                    being exploited to deliver record-breaking DDoSes. One
                    attack on a customer using the Cloudflare content delivery
                    network peaked at 201 million requests per second, almost
                    triple the previous record Cloudflare had seen of

                      >71 million rps</a
                    >. An attack on a site using Google’s cloud infrastructure
                    topped out at 398 million rps, more than 7.5 times bigger
                    than the previous record Google recorded of 46 million rps.

                  <p>
                    [...] The vulnerability that HTTP/2 Rapid Reset exploits
                    resides in HTTP/2, which went into effect in 2015 and has
                    undergone several overhauls since then. Compared to the
                    HTTP/1 and HTTP/1.1 protocols that predated it, HTTP/2
                    provided the ability for a single HTTP request to carry 100
                    or more “streams” that a server can receive all at once. The
                    resulting throughput can lead to almost 100 times higher
                    utilization of each connection, compared with the earlier
                    HTTP protocols.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The increased efficiency wasn’t just useful for distributing
                    video, audio, and other sorts of benign content. DDoSers
                    began leveraging HTTP/2 to deliver attacks that were orders
                    of magnitude larger. There are two properties in the
                    protocol allowing for these new efficient DDoSes. Before
                    discussing them, it’s useful to review how DDoS attacks work
                    in general and then move on to the way HTTP protocols prior
                    to 2.0 worked.

                    [...] The type of attack carried out by HTTP/2 Rapid Reset
                    falls into a third form of DDoS known as Application Layer

                    Marks on the ribcage of a 48,000-year-old cave lion skeleton
                    suggest the animal was killed by Neanderthals, making it the
                    first evidence that our nearest human cousins hunted the Ice
                    Age predators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A team of paleoanthropologists and archaeologists recently
                    scrutinized the remains of four lions: the aforementioned
                    skeleton, which was excavated in 1985 in Siegsdorf, Germany,
                    and phalanges and sesamoid bones from three lion specimens
                    excavated from Einhornhöle, Germany, in 2019. The former
                    showed evidence of being punctured by a wooden-tipped
                    spear—a known weapon of Neanderthals—and the latter three
                    had cut marks that suggested they were butchered in a way to
                    keep the animals' claws preserved on the fur. The team's
                    research is published today in Scientific Reports.

                    "The notion that Neanderthals interacted with cave lions
                    holds deep significance," said Gabriele Russo, a
                    paleoanthropologist at Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen
                    and the study's lead author, in an email to Gizmodo. "It
                    reveals that Neanderthals were actively engaged with their
                    environment, which included encounters with formidable
                    creatures like lions. These interactions encompassed not
                    only the cultural use of lion body parts but also the
                    ability to hunt them."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cave lions (Panthera spelaea) are now extinct, but they
                    inhabited most of northern Eurasia during the Pleistocene,
                    recently enough that some preserved cave lions look like
                    they're just sleeping. They made up a remarkable tableau of
                    megafauna on the Ice Age steppe, alongside creatures like
                    the woolly rhinoceros, ancient, extinct elephant species,
                    and the woolly mammoth. And while the mammoth is a known
                    quarry of Neanderthals, it now appears that the human group
                    also hunted cave lions, one of the most prominent Ice Age
                    predators.

                    Speaking to partners last week as part of their annual Open
                    Innovation Platform forum in Europe, a big portion of TSMC's
                    roadshow was dedicated to the next generation of the
                    company's foundry technology. TSMC's 2 nm-class <a

                      >N2P, and N2X process technologies</a
                    > are set to introduce multiple innovations, including
                    nanosheet gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, backside power
                    delivery, and super-high-performance metal-insulator-metal
                    (SHPMIM) capacitor over the next few years. But in order to
                    take advantage of these innovations, TSMC warns, chip
                    designers will need to use all-new electronic design
                    automation (EDA), simulation, and verification tools as well
                    as IP. And while making such a big shift is never an easy
                    task, TSMC is bringing some good news to chip designers
                    early-on: even with N2 still a couple of years out, many of
                    the major EDA tools, verification tools, foundation IP, and
                    even analog IP for N2 are already available for use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Preparations for the start of N2 chip production,
                    scheduled for sometime in the second half of 2025, began
                    long ago. Nanosheet GAA transistors behave differently than
                    familiar FinFETs, so EDA and other tool and IP makers had to
                    build their products from scratch. This is where TSMC's Open
                    Innovation Platform (OIP) demonstrated its prowess and
                    enabled TSMC's partners to start working on their products
                    well in advance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By now, major EDA tools from Cadence and Synopsys as well as
                    many tools from Ansys and Siemens EDA have been certified by
                    TSMC, so chip developers can already use them to design
                    chips. Also, EDA software programs from Cadence and Synopsys
                    are ready for analog design migration. Furthermore,
                    Cadence's EDA tools already support N2P's backside power
                    delivery network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With pre-built IP designs, things are taking a bit longer.
                    TSMC's foundation libraries and IP, including standard
                    cells, GPIO/ESD, PLL, SRAM, and ROM are ready both for
                    mobile and high-performance computing applications.
                    Meanwhile, some PLLs exist in pre-silicon development kits,
                    whereas others are silicon proven. Finally, blocks such as
                    non-volatile memory, interface IP, and even chiplet IP are
                    not yet available - bottlenecking some chip designs - but
                    these blocks in active development or planned for
                    development by companies like Alphawave, Cadence, Credo,
                    eMemory, GUC, and Synopsys, according to a TSMC slide.
                    Ultimately, the ecosystem of tools and libraries for
                    designing 2 nm chips is coming together, but it's not all
                    there quite yet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Although many of the major building blocks for chips
                    are N2-ready, a lot of work still has to be done by many
                    companies before TSMC's 2 nm-class process technologies go
                    into mass production. Large companies, which tend to design
                    (or co-design) IP and development tools themselves are
                    already working on their 2 nm chips, and should be ready
                    with their products by the time mass production starts in 2H
                    2025. Other players can also fire up their design engines
                    because 2 nm preps are well underway at TSMC and its
                    partners.

                    Using "Protect the children!" as their rallying cry, red
                    states are enacting digital pornography restrictions.
                    Texas's effort, H.B. 1181, requires commercial pornographic
                    websites—and others, as we'll see shortly—to verify that
                    their users are adults, and to display state-drafted
                    warnings about pornography's alleged health dangers. In late
                    August, a federal district judge blocked the law from taking
                    effect. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
                    expedited Texas's appeal, and it just held oral argument.
                    This law, or one of the others like it, seems destined for
                    the Supreme Court.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So continues what the Washington Post, in the headline of a
                    1989 op-ed by the columnist Nat Henthoff, once called "<a
                      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1989/01/21/the-eternal-war-against-pornography/be7a041f-2ec8-41f5-a38e-4398bd8ff506/"

                  <p>
                    It's true that the First Amendment does not protect
                    obscenity—which the Supreme Court defines as "prurient" and
                    "patently offensive" material devoid of "serious literary,
                    artistic, political, or scientific value." Like many past
                    anti-porn crusaders, however, Texas's legislators blew past
                    those confines. H.B. 1181 targets material that is obscene

                    We hear plenty of legitimate concerns regarding the new wave
                    of generative AI, from the human jobs it could replace to
                    its potential for creating misinformation. But one area that
                    often gets overlooked is the sheer amount of energy these
                    systems use. In the not-so-distant future, the technology
                    could be consuming the same amount of electricity as an
                    entire country.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Alex de Vries, a researcher at the Vrije Universiteit
                    Amsterdam,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2542-4351(23)00365-3"

                    which examines the environmental impact of AI systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    De Vries notes that the training phase for large language
                    models is often considered the most energy-intensive, and
                    therefore has been the focus of sustainability research in
                    AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Following training, models are deployed into a production
                    environment and begin the inference phase. In the case of
                    ChatGPT, this involves generating live responses to user
                    queries. Little research has gone into the inference phase,
                    but De Vries believes there are indications that this period
                    might contribute significantly to an AI model's life-cycle
                    costs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to research firm SemiAnalysis, OpenAI required
                    3,617 Nvidia HGX A100 servers, with a total of 28,936 GPUs,
                    to support ChatGPT, implying an energy demand of 564 MWh per
                    day. For comparison, an estimated 1,287 MWh was used in
                    GPT-3's training phase, so the inference phase's energy
                    demands were considerably higher.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google, which reported that 60% of AI-related energy
                    consumption from 2019 to 2021 stemmed from inference, is
                    integrating AI features into its search engine. Back in

                  <p>
                    [...] "It would be advisable for developers not only to
                    focus on optimizing AI, but also to critically consider the
                    necessity of using AI in the first place, as it is unlikely
                    that all applications will benefit from AI or that the
                    benefits will always outweigh the costs," said De Vries.

                    Regular salt looks like a fine white powder. Sure, it tastes
                    good, but it's not very interesting to look at.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But what if I told you that you could transform the salt
                    sitting in your kitchen into a work of art?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What if I told you that within a few hours, you could turn
                    white, powdery salt into premium salt crystals shaped like
                    pyramids, flowers and Eiffel towers?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Plus, you don't need to be good at art. You don't need to
                    carve those pyramids yourself. Just sit beside the stove,
                    and watch as pyramid salt crystals grow from a dish of salt
                    water right before your eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me show you how to do just that.</p>
                  <p>
                    To my knowledge, it's the only such guide on the Internet.

                    Numerous visual illusions are caused by limits in the way
                    our eyes and visual neurones work – rather than more complex
                    psychological processes,
                    <a
                      href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011117"

                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers examined illusions in which an object's
                    surroundings affect the way we see its colour or pattern.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists and philosophers have long debated whether these
                    illusions are caused by neural processing in the eye and
                    low-level visual centres in the brain, or involve
                    higher-level mental processes such as context and prior
                    knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the new study Dr Jolyon Troscianko, from the University
                    of Exeter, co-developed a model that suggests simple limits
                    to neural responses – not deeper psychological processes –
                    explain these illusions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our eyes send messages to the brain by making neurones fire
                    faster or slower," said Dr Troscianko, from the Centre for
                    Ecology and Conservation on Exeter's Penryn Campus in
                    Cornwall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "However, there's a limit to how quickly they can fire, and
                    previous research hasn't considered how the limit might
                    affect the ways we see colour."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This throws into the air a lot of long-held
                    assumptions about how visual illusions work," Dr Troscianko
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said the findings also shed light on the popularity of
                    high-definition televisions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Modern high dynamic range televisions create bright white
                    regions that are over 10,000 times brighter than their
                    darkest black, approaching the contrast levels of natural
                    scenes," Dr Troscianko added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "How our eyes and brains can handle this contrast is a
                    puzzle because tests show that the highest contrasts we
                    humans can see at a single spatial scale is around 200:1.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Even more confusingly, the neurones connecting our eyes to
                    our brains can only handle contrasts of about 10:1.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our model shows how neurones with such limited contrast
                    bandwidth can combine their signals to allow us to see these
                    enormous contrasts, but the information is 'compressed' –
                    resulting in visual illusions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Ultimately this shows how a system with a severely
                    limited neural bandwidth and sensitivity can perceive
                    contrasts larger than 10,000:1."

                    release announcing the lawsuit today. He said the app
                    “illegally baits children into addictive and unhealthy use”
                    with features that encourage young users to scroll endlessly

                  <p>
                    The lawsuit alleges that TikTok violates the Utah Consumer
                    Sales Practices Act (UCSPA) by making the app addictive to
                    children and profiting from it; misrepresenting things like
                    the safety of its app and fairness of its policies; and
                    claiming that it’s based in the US and not controlled from

                I thought this was an interesting, albeit extreme, example of
                how the data that phone software harvests can be used for evil
                purposes. In this case it's a loan software that harvests
                contact data.

                    There are many apps that promise hassle-free loans in
                    minutes. Not all of them are predatory. But many - once
                    downloaded - harvest your contacts, photos and ID cards, and
                    use that information later to extort you.

                    When customers don't repay on time - and sometimes even when
                    they do - they share this information with a call centre
                    where young agents of the gig economy, armed with laptops
                    and phones are trained to harass and humiliate people into

                    whore. When they threatened to tarnish her daughter's

                    The flight laser transceiver and ground-based laser
                    transmitter will need to point with great precision.
                    Reaching their targets will be akin to hitting a dime from a
                    mile away while the dime is moving. So the transceiver needs
                    to be isolated from the spacecraft vibrations, which would
                    otherwise nudge the laser beam off target. Initially, Psyche
                    will aim the flight transceiver in the direction of Earth
                    while autonomous systems on the flight transceiver assisted
                    by the Table Mountain uplink beacon laser will control the
                    pointing of the downlink laser signal to Palomar
                    Observatory.

                    Integrated onto the Hale Telescope is a cryogenically cooled
                    superconducting nanowire photon-counting array receiver,
                    developed by JPL. The instrument is equipped with high-speed
                    electronics for recording the time of arrival of single
                    photons so that the signal can be decoded. The DSOC team
                    even developed new signal-processing techniques to squeeze
                    information out of the weak laser signals that will have
                    been transmitted over tens to hundreds of millions of miles.

                    In 2013, NASA's Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration
                    tested record-breaking uplink and downlink data rates
                    between Earth and the moon. In 2021, NASA's Laser
                    Communications Relay Demonstration launched to test
                    high-bandwidth optical communications relay capabilities
                    from geostationary orbit so that spacecraft don't require a
                    direct line of sight with Earth to communicate. And last
                    year, NASA's TeraByte InfraRed Delivery system downlinked
                    the highest-ever data rate from a satellite in low-Earth
                    orbit to a ground-based receiver.

                    DSOC is taking optical communications into deep space,
                    paving the way for high-bandwidth communications beyond the
                    moon and 1,000 times farther than any optical communications
                    test to date. If it succeeds, the technology could lead to
                    high-data rate communications with streaming,
                    high-definition imagery that will help support humanity's
                    next giant leap: when NASA sends astronauts to Mars.

                While there are a number of small robot lawn mowers on the
                market, I think they mostly mow randomly inside a fenced off
                area (the fence may be a buried wire with an AC carrier signal?)
                Designed for mowing one residential lawn, and not using any sort
                of optimal mowing path.

                Now Honda is demoing a battery powered zero-turn mower that can
                be trained by a human mowing a big lawn once. Multiple mowing
                jobs can be stored in memory for future playback.

                They claim various AI features, but from the looks of it, this
                is limited to safety--stopping if the machine senses people
                and/or new objects in the stored mowing path. From the YT text:

                    Capable of operating in manual or autonomous mode, when
                    manually operated, the Honda AWM learns the mowing routes
                    and patterns set by the operator. In autonomous operation,
                    the AWM reproduces these routes and patterns, which can free
                    up workers' time to focus on more high-value tasks.

                Prediction for the next generation of AI mower--automatically
                re-works the internal mowing path each mow to keep from leaving
                tell-tale patterns in the grass. Of course each path is
                optimized, so all these different patterns take about the same
                time to mow the given lawn.

                    "VBScript is being deprecated," Microsoft said. "In future

                    VBScript debuted in 1996 and its most recent release,
                    version 5.8, dates back

                    used among system administrators to automate tasks until it

                    Unfortunately, Microsoft never managed to get other browser
                    makers to support VBScript, so outside of
                    Microsoft-exclusive environments, web developers tended to
                    favor JavaScript for client-side tasks.

                    One of the most vital parts of the Psyche mission will be
                    getting the spacecraft to this distant asteroid and then
                    keeping it in place so its scientific instruments can do
                    their jobs.

                  <p>
                    To do this, the spacecraft, which measures 16.1 by 7.1 by
                    7.8 feet (4.9 by 2.2 by 2.4 meters), will depend on a solar
                    electric propulsion system that captures sunlight with its
                    large solar arrays and then converts it to electric and
                    magnetic fields. These fields accelerate charged atoms of
                    the propellant xenon ,  which is commonly found in plasma
                    televisions on Earth. These

                    >, in the form of blue-glowing ionized gas, are then blasted
                    out into space by the Psyche spacecraft's four thrusters,
                    providing the craft with propulsion that looks like
                    something straight out of science fiction.
                  </p>

                      >According to NASA</a
                    >, each of these four thrusters operates one at a time,
                    providing a force equivalent to the weight of three quarters
                    in your hand here on Earth — which, in the microgravity and
                    frictionless environment of space, is enough to propel the
                    spacecraft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even with these revolutionary "Hall-effect thrusters" —
                    which, so far, have been used to get only as far as the moon
                    — the spacecraft's journey to the vicinity of Jupiter won't
                    be a 'straight shot." Instead, it will require a
                    gravity-assisted slingshot maneuver around Mars in 2026, and
                    Psyche will arrive at its metal-rich asteroid target in
                    August 2029.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spacecraft will then make orbits of the asteroid at a
                    distance of around 430 miles (700 km), which will decrease
                    as the mission proceeds. The spacecraft will use
                    progressively closer orbital periods ,  or "regimes ,"  to
                    investigate different characteristics of the asteroid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During its first orbital regime (A), lasting 56 days, the
                    spacecraft will use its magnetometer to search Psyche for an
                    ancient magnetic field, which would provide evidence that
                    the asteroid was once a planetary body. As the spacecraft
                    does this, its multispectral imager will assess the
                    topography of Psyche's surface. This will continue as the
                    NASA orbiter draws closer to the asteroid, hopefully
                    revealing more details of these characteristics,
                    particularly during the next two orbital regimes (B1 and
                    B2), which will last 192 days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moving even closer to the asteroid, during the 100-day
                    orbital regime C, Psyche's telecommunications system, which
                    sends data to Earth and receives commands from ground
                    control via radio waves, will be used to investigate the
                    gravitational influence of the metal-rich asteroid. This
                    could help better constrain its mass and density and thus
                    the asteroid's interior composition and structure.

                    In the short story Chains (1929), the Hungarian writer
                    Frigyes Karinthy described a game where a group of people
                    were discussing how the members of the human society were
                    closer together than ever before. To prove this point, one
                    participant proposes that any person out of the entire Earth
                    population (around 1.8 billion at that time) could be
                    reached using nothing except each personal network of
                    acquaintances, betting that the resulting chain would be of
                    no more than five individuals. The story coined the
                    expression "six degrees of separation" to reflect the idea
                    that all people of the world are six or fewer social
                    connections apart from each other. The concept was later
                    generalized to that of "small-world" networks, where the
                    maximal social distance (the diameter of the network) scales
                    logarithmically, rather than linearly, with the size of the
                    population.

                    [...] One of the most intriguing and captivating features of
                    social networks is that they are organized so that no
                    individual is more than six connections apart from any
                    other, an empirical regularity known as the six degrees of
                    separation. Why social networks have this ultrasmall world
                    organization—where the diameter of a graph of the network is
                    independent of the network size over several orders of
                    magnitude—is still unknown. Our study shows that this
                    property is the direct consequence of the dynamical
                    evolution of any network structure where individuals weigh
                    their aspiration to improve their centrality against the
                    costs incurred in forming or maintaining connections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We look at the evolution of a graph whose growth is governed
                    by a simple compensation rule. This rule balances the cost
                    incurred by nodes in maintaining connections and the benefit
                    accrued by the chosen links. In this case, the graph's
                    asymptotic equilibrium state (a Nash equilibrium, where no
                    further actions would produce more benefit than cost)
                    features a diameter that, irrespective of the network's
                    initial connectivity structure, does not depend on the
                    system's size and is equal to six.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our study points out that evolutionary rules of the kind
                    traditionally associated with human cooperation and altruism
                    can in fact account also for the emergence of the six
                    degrees of separation in social networks.

                    [...] Part of the draw of Imagetwin, specialists say, is
                    that it looks for duplications in two ways. The software
                    makes "something like a fingerprint" for every image in a
                    paper, says Patrick Starke, one of its developers. It then
                    scans the entire paper for repeats of that fingerprint. It
                    also scans its large database to see whether that
                    fingerprint appears in past papers — a process that takes
                    only five to ten seconds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The end goal, Christopher says, is to incorporate AI
                    tools such as Imagetwin into the paper-review process, just
                    as many publishers routinely use software to scan text for
                    plagiarism. But AI on its own isn't enough. "You have to use
                    your own expertise and question these things. None of the
                    flags you receive [from Imagetwin] are a definite 'This is
                    fraud,'" she says.

                  <p>
                    [...] Christopher hopes that the roll-out of more AI tools
                    could democratize the ability for journals to screen papers.
                    "I think we need to shed the idea that it's a luxury — it
                    actually adds value to the journal."

                    That sort of potential attack means that Microsoft needs to
                    be very careful exactly what to enable in Windows Copilot,
                    and how to enable it. Unfortunately, the strange-loop nature
                    of AI chatbots means that it's difficult – maybe even
                    impossible – to game out every possible attack scenario.
                    Human language is just too weird, and the AI chatbots
                    themselves are still very poorly understood.

              <h3>Copilot Deficit. MS Losing Money Per User.</h3>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                Microsoft is apparently losing $20 per user per month that
                installs and pays the subscription fee ($10/month) to use
                Copilot. You have got to be fairly desperate to gain market
                share if you are willing to sell it at a loss. Or they want to
                hook customers early to later hike the price, as per usual.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps more importantly, are you getting your subfees worth of
                code or help per month?<br />Is the loss real tho? After all
                they are hooking a developer to their service and they are
                gaining code and data every month to feed into their machine.
                Most of that code is probably from the Copilot so it's feeding
                itself on itself, creating delusions or AI induced
                hallucinations. Eventually it will start to believe it's own
                code.

                    As the WSJ notes, individuals pay $10 per month for GitHub
                    Copilot, but multiple sources told it that the service loses
                    an average of $20 per user per month, with some users
                    costing Microsoft as much as $80 per month. So it's likely
                    that this situation played a role in the company's decision
                    to charge a lot more for the AI capabilities it will soon
                    provide via Microsoft 365 Copilot. That service will cost
                    customers $30 per user per month on top of the normal
                    monthly Microsoft 365 subscription fee (which varies by
                    tier). It's not coincidental that Google will charge an
                    identical additional per-user fee for its similar Duet AI
                    offering.

                    intriguing, given Unity's recent history. After announcing a

                    promised never to do such a thing.

                ATARI releasing a "new" game for the 2600 console. 46 years in
                development, there wasn't just active development, have got to
                be some kind of record in and by itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sold in the classic box and cartridge form. Clearly targeting
                the collector-market since it's just 500 copies. I'm not sure
                you'll get your $60 worth tho. It doesn't look very good or
                appear to be overly interesting as a game. It's not Pitfall.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps this isn't a surprise, or should come as one. After all
                it seems the game market today is in large just remaking the
                same titles over and over again, remaking and "updating"
                previous titles etc. In that sense starting to release games for
                long dead consoles is perhaps not that far fetched.

                    Scientists have for the first time observed the early
                    universe running in extreme slow motion, unlocking one of
                    the mysteries of Einstein's expanding universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Einstein's general theory of relativity means that we should
                    observe the distant – and hence ancient – universe running
                    much slower than the present day. However, peering back that
                    far in time has proven elusive. Scientists have now cracked
                    that mystery by using quasars as 'clocks'.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Looking back to a time when the universe was just over a
                    billion years old, we see time appearing to flow five times
                    slower," said lead author of the study, Professor Geraint
                    Lewis from the School of Physics and Sydney Institute for
                    Astronomy at the University of Sydney.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If you were there, in this infant universe, one second
                    would seem like one second – but from our position, more
                    than 12 billion years into the future, that early time
                    appears to drag."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Thanks to Einstein, we know that time and space are
                    intertwined and, since the dawn of time in the singularity
                    of the Big Bang, the universe has been expanding," Professor
                    Lewis said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This expansion of space means that our observations of the
                    early universe should appear to be much slower than time
                    flows today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Professor Lewis worked with astro-statistician Dr
                    Brewer to examine details of 190 quasars observed over two
                    decades. Combining the observations taken at different
                    colours (or wavelengths) – green light, red light and into
                    the infrared – they were able to standardise the 'ticking'
                    of each quasar. Through the application of Bayesian
                    analysis, they found the expansion of the universe imprinted
                    on each quasar's ticking.

                  <p>
                    "With these exquisite data, we were able to chart the tick
                    of the quasar clocks, revealing the influence of expanding
                    space," Professor Lewis said.

                    "Despite timely written demand along with documentation from
                    Plaintiffs through their counsel, the Company has not
                    advanced to Plaintiffs their Expenses actually and
                    reasonably incurred related to the various Proceedings," the
                    lawsuit said. "Over two months after Plaintiffs' initial

                    According to Bloomberg, X "has paid about $600,000 of what
                    it owes, but has withheld $1,158,427 in fees for lawyers'
                    work representing the former top managers." An X lawyer
                    argued that fees related to Gadde's testimony in front of

                    Michael Blanchard, one of the company's lawyers, said X

                    Gadde's lawyers, which they found to be "quite excessive."
                    Blanchard said the fees weren't for litigation "that's going
                    to go for several years," but instead were for "one day of
                    testimony." X officials considered the request a "clear

                    Tech jobs, once a fairly safe and lucrative bet, have become
                    more elusive. In 2022 and 2023, tech companies around the
                    world laid off more than 400,000 workers, according to
                    <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/">Layoffs.fyi</a>, a site that
                    tracks job losses across the industry. Tens of thousands of
                    those cuts have come from huge employers like Meta and
                    Amazon, and some firms have instituted hiring freezes. The
                    layoffs have been particularly brutal for immigrant workers,
                    who have been left scrambling for sponsorship in the US
                    after losing work.

                  <p>
                    The controversy at the Grace Hopper Celebration shows the
                    fallout of those job losses, as women and non-binary people
                    still struggle to find equal footing in an industry
                    dominated by men. Women made up just a third of those
                    working in STEM jobs as of 2021, according to the US

                    people who know the profile ID of a user to view that user's
                    profile photo, name, birth year, and location. The 23andMe

                    if a user chooses a strong password and uses two-factor

                    still be swept up in scraping incidents like the one
                    recently confirmed. The only sure way to protect it from
                    online theft is to not store it there in the first place.

                    Elias Ingebrand let ten dementia sufferers, eight of whom
                    lived in care facilities, try using computer tablets for the
                    first time in their lives. A staff member or a loved one was
                    there for support, but the only instruction given to
                    participants was to use the tablet as they wished. It soon
                    turned out that the device made them curious.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I was rather surprised at this. I may have expected that it
                    would just lie there and that they would talk about
                    something else, but we saw that they focused their attention
                    on it," he says.<br />[...] A woman who used to do
                    orienteering spontaneously started using the tablet to check
                    competition results. A man who used to be restless and
                    aggressive learned how to navigate to the Open Archive of
                    SVT, the Swedish public television broadcaster. After a
                    while, staff noted that he would sit and watch for a long
                    time, calmly and focused. This was a side of him they had
                    never seen before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Elias Ingebrand was surprised to find that people with
                    dementia could solve the mysteries of the tablet also
                    without help from staff or loved ones, by collaborating and
                    learning from each other. Also in this context, they managed
                    to focus on the task at hand. As far as he knows, no-one has
                    studied collaboration between dementia sufferers before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "My thesis has an impact on how we look at people with
                    dementia. They are not to be treated as children, but as
                    people who still have a will and an incentive to do things.
                    This is ultimately about having the opportunity to
                    participate in meaningful activities based on the person's
                    own interests and desires."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This of course presents a challenge to care facility staff,
                    who are often too busy to sit down with just one person for
                    any length of time. Letting people with dementia do things
                    in collaboration could be a solution worth trying. And even
                    though this study is about computer tablets, Elias Ingebrand
                    believes that its results are valid also for other forms of
                    learning.

                    University of Cambridge psychologists have developed the
                    first validated "misinformation susceptibility test".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The quick two-minute quiz gives a solid indication of how
                    vulnerable a person is to being duped by the kind of
                    fabricated news that is flooding online spaces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The test, proven to work through a series of experiments
                    involving over 8,000 participants taking place over two
                    years, has been deployed by polling organisation YouGov to
                    determine how susceptible Americans are to fake headlines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first survey to use the new 20-point test, called 'MIST'
                    by researchers and developed using an early version of
                    ChatGPT, has found that – on average – adult US citizens
                    correctly classified two-thirds (65%) of headlines they were
                    shown as either real or fake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the polling found that younger adults are worse
                    than older adults at identifying false headlines, and that
                    the more time someone spent online recreationally, the less
                    likely they were to be able to tell real news from
                    misinformation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This runs counter to prevailing public attitudes regarding
                    online misinformation spread, say researchers – that older,
                    less digitally-savvy "boomers" are more likely to be taken
                    in by fake news.

                    Meta's new Emu AI algorithm allows users to generate
                    unsavory content involving weapons and nudity while blocking

                    Meta’s continued experiments with piloting us into a
                    half-baked future appear to be backfiring.

                    Meta’s new algorithm, called Emu which stands for
                    “expressive media universe,” is the brain behind the
                    stickers. On Meta platforms like Instagram, Facebook
                    Stories, WhatsApp, and Messenger, users can input a phrase
                    or word and have a few different sticker choices generated
                    for use in conversations. The company, however, appears to
                    have safeguards in place that more closely resemble Swiss
                    cheese as opposed to guardrails as certain controversial
                    phrases are blocked while synonyms of those same phrases are
                    deemed okay.

                    [...] In Gizmodo’s own tests, the phrase “elon musk, large
                    breasts” was blocked, while “elon musk mammaries” got past
                    Emu’s filters. Phrases “spongebob rifle” and “karl marx
                    underwear” generated stickers as well. Most jarringly,
                    searching for “pol pot” generated a sticker of the Cambodian

                    generated a barrage of stickers of people in gas masks, some
                    of which were laying down with their eyes closed. The prompt
                    “school shooting” also showed several children holding guns
                    while “school shooting mass murder” goes against Community

                    Up to half of consumers may decide to pour perfectly good
                    milk down the drain based solely on their glance at the date
                    label on the carton, a new study suggests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers using eye-tracking technology found that 50% of
                    study participants declared their intent to throw away milk
                    based on the date stamped on the container – without ever
                    even looking at the label phrasing in front of the date.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each participant saw one of three phrasing options: "Sell
                    by," "Best if used by" or "Use by" a given date, as well as
                    containers with no label at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We asked them if they intended to discard it, and if they
                    said yes, it didn't matter which phrase was there," said
                    senior study author Brian Roe, professor of agricultural,
                    environment and development economics at The Ohio State
                    University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "As soon as we changed the printed date, that was a huge
                    mover of whether or not they would discard or not. So we
                    documented both where their eyes were and what they said was
                    going to happen. And in both cases, it's all about the date,
                    and the phrase is second fiddle."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Policymakers and industry leaders are working toward
                    settling on a universal two-phrase system – one when
                    quality, but not safety, is the concern, and a second phrase
                    for items where safety may be a concern, Roe said. To date,
                    they haven't landed on what those phrases would be.

                    "If you're going to have an education campaign, it helps to
                    have a set of phrases out there that people can cling to –
                    but in the end, so few actually look at the phrase. They
                    look at the date," he said. "The date signifies a point
                    after which you can expect quality to degrade. If you can
                    get firms to push that date further out, then people are
                    going to be willing to use the milk, or whatever it is, for
                    a few more days, and waste a lot less food."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "But we were a bit surprised that over half of the
                    viewing sessions featured no attention on the phrase
                    whatsoever," he said. "The date is more salient – you have
                    to reference it against the calendar. It's more actionable
                    than the phrase is.

                  <p>
                    "For policy reasons, it's still important to narrow the
                    phrases down to two choices. But that's only the beginning –
                    there needs to be a broader conversation about pushing those
                    date horizons back to help minimize food waste."

                    Paleontologists at University College Cork (UCC) have found
                    the first molecular evidence of pheomelanin, the pigment
                    that produces ginger coloration, in the fossil record.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new study reports the preservation of molecular
                    fragments of the pigment pheomelanin in 10-million-year-old
                    frogs, adding molecular analysis to the paleontologists'
                    arsenal when reconstructing the original colors of extinct
                    organisms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Dr. Slater said, "This finding is so exciting because
                    it puts paleontologists in a better place to detect
                    different melanin pigments in many more fossils. This will
                    paint a more accurate picture of ancient animal color and
                    will answer important questions about the evolution of
                    colors in animals. Scientists still don't know how—or
                    why—pheomelanin evolved, because it is toxic to animals, but
                    the fossil record might just unlock the mystery."

                    First, Badbox. Cheap Android streaming boxes, usually
                    costing less than $50, are sold online and in
                    brick-and-mortar shops. These set-top boxes often are
                    unbranded or sold under different names, partly obscuring
                    their source. In the second half of 2022, Human Security
                    says in its report, its researchers spotted an Android app
                    that appeared to be linked to inauthentic traffic and
                    connected to the domain flyermobi.com. When Milisic posted

                    started diving in.

                    they reach the hands of resellers—researchers don't exactly
                    know where—a firmware backdoor is added to them. This

                    [...] Then there's what Human Security calls Peachpit. This
                    is an app-based fraud element, which has been present on
                    both the TV boxes as well as Android phones and iPhones,
                    Reid says. The company identified 39 Android, iOS, and TV
                    box apps that were involved. "These are template-based
                    applications—not very high quality," says Joao Santos, a
                    security researcher at the company. Apps about developing
                    six-pack abs and logging the amount of water a person drinks
                    were included.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The apps performed a range of fraudulent behavior, including
                    hidden advertisements, spoofed web traffic, and
                    malvertising. The research says that while those behind
                    Peachpit appear different from those behind Badbox, it is
                    likely they are working together in some way. "They have
                    this SDK that did the ad fraud part, and we found a version
                    of this SDK that matches the name of the module that was
                    being dropped on the Badbox," Santos says, referring to a
                    software development kit. "That was another level of
                    connection that we found."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While the attackers have been slowed, the boxes are
                    still in people's homes and on their networks. And unless
                    someone has technical skills, the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/01/preinstalled-malware-infested-t95-tv-box-from-amazon"
                      >malware is very hard to remove</a
                    >. "You can think of these Badboxes as kind of like sleeper
                    cells. They're just sitting there waiting for instruction
                    sets," Reid says. Ultimately, for people buying TV streaming
                    boxes, the advice is to buy branded devices, where the
                    manufacturer is clear and trusted. As Reid says, "Friends
                    don't let friends plug in weird IoT devices into their home
                    networks."

                    As AI systems have grown in power and sophistication, so
                    have concerns about their ability to create ever more
                    realistic virtual versions of real people - what are
                    sometimes called deepfakes.

                    wave of strikes that have disrupted Hollywood, with Stranger
                    Things and the Last of Us among the shows to be affected.

                    The leader of Russia's space corporation, Yuri Borisov,
                    discussed his country's future ambitions in space on Tuesday
                    at the International Astronautical Congress. He spoke
                    expansively about Russia's plans to build a new space
                    station in low-Earth orbit, the Russian Orbital Station, as
                    well as other initiatives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are expecting to design, manufacture, and launch several
                    modules by 2027," Borisov said via a translator at the
                    conference, which is being held in Baku, Azerbaijan, this
                    year. The conference's plenary sessions are being
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FidfZ8iOxw"
                      >livestreamed on YouTube</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This space station will reside in a polar orbit, Borisov
                    added, allowing it to observe the entire planet's surface.
                    Its purpose will be to test new materials, new technologies,
                    and new medicines. “It will be like a permanently
                    functioning laboratory,” he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It all may have looked and sounded good on the
                    international stage, but the presentation had something of
                    the feel of a Potemkin Village, which refers to fake
                    villages designed to impress the Russian empress Catherine
                    the Great two centuries ago. Put another way, most (if not
                    all) of the presentation was based on vaporware rather than
                    hardware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shortly before Borisov took the stage, Russian media sources
                    revealed that the country's budget for space activities is
                    due to drop over the next two years—rather than rise to meet
                    the challenge of these ambitious new space programs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] No one doubts the ability of Russia to build space
                    stations, as the country has a long history of assembling
                    successful orbital outposts. However, since the dissolution
                    of the Soviet Union, Russia has struggled to build new
                    hardware for spaceflight activities. Both its Nauka space
                    station module and Luna 25 spacecraft that recently crashed
                    into the Moon were essentially mothballed projects largely
                    constructed decades ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea that Russia will now build a new space station and
                    launch it within the next four years at a reduced budget is
                    especially difficult to comprehend in the current situation.
                    The country's main focus is on financing and fighting its
                    unprovoked war against Ukraine, and as the space budget
                    story shows, resources for the space program are likely to
                    be reduced rather than increased.

                    SpaceX said last month its Starlink network, with more than
                    4,000 operational satellites, has surpassed 2 million active
                    customers and is available on all seven continents. SpaceX
                    continues to launch satellites, sometimes multiple times per
                    week, to add capacity to the Starlink network. OneWeb, which
                    recently merged with the French satellite company Eutelsat,
                    has more than 600 satellites beaming broadband signals from
                    orbit. The slightly higher altitude of OneWeb's satellites
                    means that its network doesn't require as many spacecraft
                    for global coverage.

                    Amazon's Kuiper constellation will number 3,236 satellites,
                    spread out in 98 orbital planes, or pathways, crisscrossing
                    the planet at an average altitude of about 380 miles (610
                    kilometers). In its license application with the Federal
                    Communications Commission, Amazon said the Kuiper satellites
                    will fly in mid-inclination orbits, enabling Internet
                    service for customers between 56 degrees north and south
                    latitude.

                    "Prior to [IDS], the PC or TRS-80 were only engineered
                    originally to be single-user, and they weren't set up to be
                    multi-user," Green told Ars. "The fact that VAX and VMS in
                    general were designed for [multiple users] from the scratch
                    is what facilitated the multi-user aspect."

                  <p>
                    The VAX served DEC well throughout the '80s and into the
                    '90s, but as the latter decade went on, DEC began to face
                    stiff competition from UNIX vendors, particularly Sun
                    Microsystems. DEC struggled to change with the times, and
                    the company ultimately failed. In 1998, DEC was acquired by
                    Compaq, and in 2001, Compaq was acquired by Hewlett-Packard.
                    The DEC line, including the VAX/VMS system, was discontinued
                    and faded from the market.

                    Evidence from Gough's Cave already suggests that the eating
                    of the bodies there was of a more ritualistic form. This is
                    because there is ample evidence that the people responsible
                    were hunting and eating lots of other animals, such as deer
                    and horses, while the careful preparation of some of the
                    human remains like the skull cup and an engraved bone show
                    that some was thought was being put into the cannibalism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The fact that we find cannibalism being practiced
                    often on multiple occasions in over a short period of time,
                    in a fairly localized area and solely by individuals
                    attributed to the Magdalenian culture, means we believe this
                    behavior was one that was performed widely by the
                    Magdalenian, and was therefore a funerary behavior in
                    itself," says William.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this context, the eating of the dead can be seen as
                    different in practice, but perhaps not meaning, to
                    cremations, burials or mummification.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Building on this, William and Silvia were then able to look
                    at whether any genetic analysis had been done on the human
                    remains from these sites. This would enable the researchers
                    to see if there were any links between who was practicing
                    which funerary behaviors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Remarkably, the genetic evidence seems to suggest that the
                    two groups practicing different funerary behaviors were
                    genetically distinct populations. All the sites from which
                    evidence of cannibalism has been found show that the people
                    were part of a genetic group known as "GoyetQ2," while all
                    of the more ordinary burials were of people who belonged to
                    the "Villabruna" genetic group.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While both groups were living in Europe at the same time,
                    individuals showing GoyetQ2 ancestry are associated with the
                    region spanning the French-Spanish border, while Villabruna
                    ancestry was carried by individuals who inhabited the
                    Italian-Balkan region. This implies that when the practice
                    of eating the dead ended and more conventional burials
                    became common place in north-western Europe, it wasn't
                    through a spreading of ideas but rather Epigravettian people
                    replacing the Magdalenian.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "At this time, during the terminal period of the
                    Paleolithic, you actually see a turnover in both genetic
                    ancestry and funerary behavior," explains William. "The
                    Magdalenian associated ancestry and funerary behavior is
                    replaced by Epigravettian associated ancestry and funerary
                    behavior, indicative of population replacement as
                    Epigravettian groups migrated into north-western Europe."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Questions still remain about the funerary practices of
                    these ancient humans. For example, William and his
                    colleagues are now trying to can figure out whether these
                    cannibalized humans were related to one another, or whether
                    they were eating people from outside their immediate groups.

                    Humans and primates have brain regions in the temporal lobe
                    that are specialised in perceiving faces and bodies. Dogs
                    also possess a temporal lobe that evolved independently of
                    the primate brain. In recent years, behavioural research has
                    shown that dogs, like humans, are experts in perceiving
                    facial expressions and bodily gestures such as hand signals.
                    "Whether this behavioural expertise is also reflected in the
                    dog brain was the content of our study. Only a few research
                    groups can conduct comparative magnetic resonance imaging
                    studies with dogs," explains first author Magdalena Boch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The study with 40 human participants and 15 pet dogs
                    now provided the first evidence that dogs, like humans, have
                    a brain region in the temporal lobe that is specialised in
                    the visual perception of body postures. In addition, further
                    regions in the dog brain are equally involved in perceiving
                    faces and bodies. In contrast to humans, however, this did
                    not only affect visual brain regions. When dogs look at
                    faces and bodies, there are also differences in activation
                    in areas responsible for processing smells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In humans, the authors additionally identified already known
                    regions specialised exclusively in face perception. "We
                    humans often focus on the face when communicating with
                    others. Our results suggest that faces are also an important
                    source of information for dogs. However, body postures and
                    holistic perception seem to play a superior role," Magdalena
                    Boch explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The specialised brain regions were equally active in dogs
                    when they looked at pictures of conspecifics or humans. This
                    underlines the close bond between dogs and humans, says
                    Ludwig Huber. "Dogs and humans may not be closely related,
                    but they have been close companions for thousands of years.
                    Therefore, comparing dogs and humans also gives us new
                    insights into the so-called convergent evolution of social
                    perception and information processing processes," Claus Lamm
                    concludes.

                    People can be prone to believe in conspiracy theories due to
                    a combination of personality traits and motivations,
                    including relying strongly on their intuition, feeling a
                    sense of antagonism and superiority toward others, and
                    perceiving threats in their environment, according to
                    research published by the American Psychological
                    Association.

                    [...] "Conspiracy theorists are not all likely to be
                    simple-minded, mentally unwell folks—a portrait which is
                    routinely painted in popular culture," said Bowes. "Instead,
                    many turn to conspiracy theories to fulfill deprived
                    motivational needs and make sense of distress and
                    impairment."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers found that overall, people were
                    motivated to believe in conspiracy theories by a need to
                    understand and feel safe in their environment and a need to
                    feel like the community they identify with is superior to
                    others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even though many conspiracy theories seem to provide clarity
                    or a supposed secret truth about confusing events, a need
                    for closure or a sense of control were not the strongest
                    motivators to endorse conspiracy theories. Instead, the
                    researchers found some evidence that people were more likely
                    to believe specific conspiracy theories when they were
                    motivated by social relationships. For instance,
                    participants who perceived social threats were more likely
                    to believe in events-based conspiracy theories, such as the
                    theory that the U.S. government planned the Sept. 11
                    terrorist attacks, rather than an abstract theory that, in
                    general, governments plan to harm their citizens to retain
                    power.

                    [...] The researchers also found that people with certain
                    personality traits, such as a sense of antagonism toward
                    others and high levels of paranoia, were more prone to
                    believe conspiracy theories. Those who strongly believed in
                    conspiracy theories were also more likely to be insecure,
                    paranoid, emotionally volatile, impulsive, suspicious,
                    withdrawn, manipulative, egocentric and eccentric.

                    The Big Five personality traits (extraversion,
                    agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism)
                    had a much weaker relationship with conspiratorial thinking,
                    though the researchers said that does not mean that general
                    personality traits are irrelevant to a tendency to believe
                    in conspiracy theories.

                    How big is the Universe? Humanity made it all the way into
                    the 1920s having
                    <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/debate/1920/cs_nrc.html"
                      ><strong>no idea</strong></a
                    >. Many people at that time thought that the Milky Way
                    <em>was</em> the entire Universe. Yes, big, but not crazy
                    big. Others thought that maybe those spirals and smudges we
                    could see were in fact other galaxies altogether, which
                    would mean the Universe is unfathomably large.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the night of October 5-6, 1923 — 100 years ago tonight —
                    Edwin Hubble made an observation that would settle the
                    question once and for all. He took a 45-minute exposure of
                    Andromeda, one of the largest and thus apparently nearest
                    "spiral nebulae", and within it he spotted a single
                    compelling star that we now call Hubble V1. We here on Earth
                    will forever have a very special relationship with that
                    star, because Hubble used its characteristics to show
                    conclusively that Andromeda was not a "spiral nebula" within
                    the Milky Way at all, but rather an entirely separate galaxy
                    which he later estimated to be about 1 million (now
                    understood to be closer to 2.5 million) light-years away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Hubble's time, many other "spiral nebulae"
                    <a href="https://www.astronomy.com/observing/an-ngc-primer/"
                      ><strong>were known</strong></a
                    >
                    that appeared much smaller than Andromeda and were therefore
                    presumably quite a bit farther away. Because of his
                    observation a hundred years ago tonight, Hubble realized
                    that even Andromeda, close enough to be seen with the naked
                    eye, is on the order of 10 quintillion
                    (10,000,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from Earth. And that
                    must mean that the Universe is absurdly, almost comically,
                    huge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Imagine what Edwin Hubble felt like sitting there at Mt.
                    Wilson Observatory, probably by himself late one evening,
                    when he became the first person ever to know that for sure.
                    His use of red ink and an exclamation point in the main
                    figure of this diary illustrates that he knew darn well the
                    significance of what he had found the minute he realized
                    what it was.
