                    Uber and Lyft say they're ending services in Minneapolis
                    over a city-mandated driver pay increase. The city council
                    pushed through the measure to bring driver pay closer to the
                    local minimum wage of $15.57 an hour.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, Uber and Lyft say they'll end services in the
                    city before the pay rise takes effect on May 1. Lyft says
                    the increase is "deeply flawed," citing a Minnesota study
                    indicating that drivers could meet the minimum wage and
                    still cover health insurance, paid leave and retirement
                    savings at lower rates of $1.21 per mile and 49 cents per
                    minute. "We support a minimum earning standard for drivers,
                    but it should be done in an honest way that keeps the
                    service affordable for riders," spokesperson CJ Macklin told
                    The Verge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An Uber spokesperson told the publication that the company
                    was disappointed by the council's choice to "ignore the data
                    and kick Uber out of the Twin Cities," putting around 10,000
                    drivers out of work. They noted Uber's confidence that by
                    working with drivers, drivers and legislators, "we can
                    achieve comprehensive statewide legislation that guarantees
                    drivers a fair minimum wage, protects their independence and
                    keeps rideshare affordable."

                    The Ubuntu-based distro currently includes
                    <em>Hexchat</em> in its default software set.
                    <em>IRC</em> isn't as trendy as <em>Discord</em> or
                    <em>Telegram</em> but it is a free, open standard that no
                    single entity controls, is relatively low-bandwidth,
                    interoperable, and efficient.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But as I reported in February:
                    <a
                      href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2024/02/hexchat-irc-client-final-release"
                      ><em>Hexchat</em> is no more.</a
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Hexchat</em> quitting the chat leaves —I so badly want
                    to type <em>leafs</em> there— Linux Mint with a dilemma and
                    an opportunity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The <em>dilemma</em> being: "should we continue shipping an
                    IRC client, and what role does it serve?" and the
                    <em>opportunity</em> being: "could we replace it with
                    something better?".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ever wondered <em>why</em> Linux Mint comes with an
                    IRC client preinstalled? It's mainly to offer a way for
                    users of the distro to talk to, ask questions, and get
                    support from other users of the distro in (relative) real
                    time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since its official IRC channels remain active, with
                    users and developers using them daily to answer questions,
                    offer support, and connect over a shared interest, should
                    the demise of <em>Hexchat</em> have to mean moating of IRC
                    entirely?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As is, IRC isn't user-friendly. It's a kind of an arcane
                    magic involving strange commands. Its onboarding is obtuse.
                    And the protocol doesn't natively support things like media
                    sharing (screenshots are useful when troubleshooting),
                    clickable links, or other modern "niceties".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And yet, IRC is a fast, established, open, and versatile
                    protocol. It's not as flashy as <em>Discord</em> but it's
                    not encumbered by superfluous social excesses or corporate
                    caveats. It's free and immediate (no sign-up required to use
                    it) which makes it ideal for 'when you need it' use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So work has begun on a new dedicated "chat room" app to
                    replace <em>Hexchat</em>, called <em>Jargonaut</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Linux Mint's goal is not to build a fully-featured IRC
                    client, or even an IRC client at all. Jargonaut is a chat
                    app that just happens to use IRC as its underlying chat
                    protocol.

                    Is there a way to stick hard and soft materials together
                    without any tape, glue or epoxy? A new study

                    in <em>ACS Central Science</em> shows that applying a small
                    voltage to certain objects forms chemical bonds that
                    securely link the objects together. Reversing the direction
                    of electron flow easily separates the two materials. This
                    electroadhesion effect could help create biohybrid robots,
                    improve biomedical implants and enable new battery

                    When an adhesive is used to attach two things, it binds the
                    surfaces either through mechanical or electrostatic forces.
                    But sometimes those attractions or bonds are difficult, if
                    not impossible, to undo. As an alternative, reversible
                    adhesion methods are being explored, including
                    electroadhesion (EA).

                    Though the term is used to describe a few different
                    phenomena, one definition involves running an electric
                    current through two materials causing them to stick
                    together, thanks to attractions or chemical bonds.
                    Previously, Srinivasa Raghavan and colleagues
                    <a
                      href="https://phys.org/news/2023-05-gluing-soft-materials.html"
                      >demonstrated that EA can hold soft, oppositely charged
                      materials together</a
                    >, and even be used to build simple structures. This time,
                    they wanted to see if EA could reversibly bind a hard
                    material, such as graphite, to a soft material, such as
                    animal tissue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For EA to occur, the authors found that the hard
                    material needs to conduct electrons, and the soft material
                    needs to contain salt ions They hypothesize that the
                    adhesion arises from chemical bonds that form between the
                    surfaces after an exchange of electrons. This may explain
                    why some metals that hold onto their electrons strongly,
                    including titanium, and some fruits that contain more sugar
                    than salts, including grapes, failed to adhere in some
                    situations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A final experiment showed that EA can occur completely
                    underwater, revealing an even wider range of possible
                    applications. The team says that this work could help create
                    new batteries, enable biohybrid robotics, enhance biomedical
                    implants and much more.

                    A 20-year-old Trojan resurfaced recently with new variants
                    that target Linux and impersonate a trusted hosted domain to
                    evade detection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers from Palo Alto Networks spotted a new Linux

                    to mimic a legitimate VMware domain, which allows the

                    is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that's been active since
                    2004 and gathers sensitive information, such as hostname and
                    IP address, from a compromised system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There has been a worrying spike in Bifrost Linux variants
                    during the past few months: Palo Alto Networks has detected
                    more than 100 instances of Bifrost samples, which "raises
                    concerns among security experts and organizations,"
                    researchers Anmol Murya and Siddharth Sharma wrote in the
                    company's newly published findings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, there is evidence that cyberattackers aim to
                    expand Bifrost's attack surface even further, using a
                    malicious IP address associated with a Linux variant hosting
                    an ARM version of Bifrost as well, they said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "By providing an ARM version of the malware, attackers can
                    expand their grasp, compromising devices that may not be
                    compatible with x86-based malware," the researchers
                    explained. "As ARM-based devices become more common,
                    cybercriminals will likely change their tactics to include
                    ARM-based malware, making their attacks stronger and able to
                    reach more targets."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Though it may be an old-timer when it comes to
                    malware, the Bifrost RAT remains a significant and evolving
                    threat to individuals and organizations alike, particularly
                    with new variants adopting

                    to evade detection, the researchers said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In their post, the researchers shared a list of
                    indicators of compromise, including malware samples and
                    domain and IP addresses associated with the latest Bifrost
                    Linux variants. The researchers advise that enterprises use
                    next-generation firewall products and
                    <a

                  <p>
                    Ultimately, the process of infection allows the malware to
                    bypass security measures and evade detection, and ultimately
                    compromise targeted systems, the researchers said.

                    to guess and access, isn't that big of a deal. What was a
                    big deal is that Burke's research embarrassed Fox News. But
                    that's what journalists are supposed to do—uncover
                    questionable practices of powerful entities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Journalists need never ask corporations for permission to
                    investigate or embarrass them, and the law shouldn't
                    encourage or force them to. Just because someone doesn't
                    like what a reporter does online doesn't mean that it's
                    without authorization and that what he did is therefore a
                    crime.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, this isn't the first time that prosecutors have
                    abused computer hacking laws to go after journalists and
                    others, like
                    <a

                    that their good faith investigations of algorithmic
                    discrimination could expose them to CFAA liability for
                    exceeding sites' terms of service.<br />[...]<br />If
                    journalists must seek permission to publish information they
                    find online from the very people they're exposing, as the
                    government's indictment of Burke suggests, it's a good bet
                    that most information from the obscure but public corners of
                    the Internet will never see the light of day. That would
                    endanger both journalism and public access to important
                    truths. The court reviewing Burke's case should dismiss the
                    charges.

                    "Our goal was to make proinsulin, purify it out to insulin,
                    and go from there," said Wheeler. "But the cow basically
                    processed it herself. She makes [a ratio of] about
                    three-to-one biologically active insulin to proinsulin. The
                    mammary gland is a magical thing."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The insulin and proinsulin were expressed at a few grams per
                    liter of milk. Because lactation was induced by hormones and
                    the milk volume was smaller than expected, the researchers
                    are unable to say exactly how much insulin a cow would make
                    during a typical lactation. But they're willing to hazard a
                    (conservative) guess; if proven correct, the numbers are
                    astounding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Wheeler said that if a cow produced one gram of
                    insulin per liter of milk and a typical Holstein cow – which
                    produces more milk than any other breed of dairy cow – made
                    40 to 50 liters a day, that adds up to a lot of insulin.
                    This is especially true considering that one international
                    unit (IU) of insulin is the biological equivalent of 0.0347
                    mg of pure crystalline insulin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That means each gram is equivalent to 28,818 units of
                    insulin," Wheeler said. "And that's just one liter;
                    Holsteins can produce 50 liters a day. You can do the math."

                    AI assistants have been widely available for a little more
                    than a year, and they already have access to our most
                    private thoughts and business secrets. People ask them about
                    becoming pregnant or terminating or preventing pregnancy,
                    consult them when considering a divorce, seek information
                    about drug addiction, or ask for edits in emails containing
                    proprietary trade secrets. The providers of these AI-powered
                    chat services are keenly aware of the sensitivity of these
                    discussions and take active steps—mainly in the form of
                    encrypting them—to prevent potential snoops from reading
                    other people's interactions.

                    But now, researchers have devised an attack that deciphers
                    AI assistant responses with surprising accuracy. The
                    technique exploits a

                    Engineers are hopeful that the veteran spacecraft Voyager 1
                    might have turned a corner after spending the last three
                    months spouting gibberish at controllers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On March 1, the Voyager team sent a command, dubbed a
                    "poke," to get the probe's Flight Data System (FDS) to try
                    some other sequences in its software in the hope of
                    circumventing whatever had become corrupted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Readers of a certain vintage will doubtless have memories of
                    poke sheets for various 1980s games. Not that this hack ever
                    used a poke to get infinite lives in Jet Set Willy, of
                    course.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Voyager 1's lifespan is not infinite, it has endured
                    far longer than anticipated and might be about to dodge yet
                    another bullet. On March 3, the mission team saw something
                    different in the stream of data returned from the
                    spacecraft, which had been unreadable since December.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An engineer with the Deep Space Network (DSN) was able to
                    decode it, and by March 10, the team determined that it
                    contained a complete memory dump from the FDS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The next step is to study the memory read-out and
                    compare it to one transmitted before the problem arose. A
                    solution to the issue could then be devised.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the original Voyager scientists, Garry Hunt, told The
                    Register that engineers at JPL were determined to get
                    communications with the stricken probe working again: "This
                    requires both skills and patience with the long time between
                    communication instructions and response."

                    [...] When Eve broke down the results by publisher, less
                    than 1 percent of the 204 publishers had put the majority of
                    their content into multiple archives. (The cutoff was 75
                    percent of their content in three or more archives.) Fewer
                    than 10 percent had put more than half their content in at
                    least two archives. And a full third seemed to be doing no
                    organized archiving at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The good news is that large academic publishers appear
                    to be reasonably good about getting things into archives;
                    most of the unarchived issues stem from smaller publishers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] None of this is to say that we've already lost
                    important research documents. But Eve's paper serves a
                    valuable function by highlighting that the risk is real.
                    We're well into the era where print copies of journals are
                    irrelevant to most academics, and digital-only academic
                    journals have proliferated. It's long past time for us to
                    have clear standards in place to ensure that digital
                    versions of research have the endurance that print works
                    have enjoyed.

                    Monitors. XY was Atari's name for what the Computer Graphics
                    industry calls '"Random Scan" and the Video Game Community
                    calls "Vector Games." The major parts of the XY Monitor are
                    the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), the Deflection Amplifiers, and
                    the High Voltage Supply.

                  <p>
                    [...] Barnett originally filed a complaint with the
                    Occupational Safety and Health Administration in January
                    2017 alleging that Boeing retaliated against him. After
                    nearly four years, the agency concluded that there was no
                    retaliation, a decision that Barnett appealed about three
                    years ago. His case has been pending since then, as the two
                    sides have gone through discovery and prehearing motions.

                    The NYPD sent a sweeping subpoena seeking information from
                    the social media account of the president of a New York City
                    police accountability organization in February, records
                    reviewed by Hell Gate show, only to withdraw its subpoena
                    when told they would need to justify the subpoena in court.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Michael Clancy, better known to friends on and off social
                    media as Rabbi, received a notice last month from X,
                    formerly known as Twitter, alerting him to the fact that the
                    NYPD had sent X a subpoena requesting "all records
                    consisting but not limited to all subscriber name(s), Email
                    address(s), Phone number(s), account creation date, IP logs
                    with timestamps (IP address of account logins and logouts),
                    all logs of previous messages sent and received." The
                    subpoena also requested "all videos sent and received,
                    including but not limited to meta-data. exit data about the
                    messages and videos" for the account.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The notification included a copy of the subpoena, which
                    warned X not to tell Clancy of its existence. "You are not
                    to disclose or notify any customer or third party of the
                    existence of this subpoena or that records were provided
                    pursuant to this subpoena," the document read.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But X, following its own corporate policy, told Clancy
                    anyway, and suggested he might want to get some legal
                    representation to fight the subpoena, recommending the
                    American Civil Liberties Union.

                    Banana Pi is now selling a fully built Wi-Fi 6 router with
                    some solid features for just $30 excluding shipping via Ali
                    Express. This router uses OpenWRT firmware and dual-core Arm
                    A9 Processor-based Triductor TR6560 SoC with Triductor's
                    TR5220 WiFi 6 chipset.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company has been selling this WiFi 6 router board on its
                    own, but now you can buy an out-of-box unit that contains an
                    enclosure for the board with six external antennas, Ethernet
                    cables, and a power adapter with either EU or US plugs. The
                    only difference here is that one of the LAN ports is
                    removed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The router supports the 802.11ax bandwidth protocol
                    and provides WPA3 password protection. Power over Ethernet
                    is optional and can be added via a module, but it needs to
                    be soldered.

                    A new industrial-scale 'sand battery' has been announced for
                    Finland, which packs 1 MW of power and a capacity of up to
                    100 MWh of thermal energy for use during those cold polar
                    winters. The new battery will be about 10 times bigger than
                    a pilot plant that's been running since 2022.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The sand battery, developed by Polar Night Energy, is a
                    clever concept. Basically, it's a big steel silo of sand (or
                    a similar solid material) that's warmed up through a heat
                    exchanger buried in the center, using excess electricity
                    from the grid – say, that generated during a spike from
                    renewable sources, when it's cheap.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That energy can then be stored for months at a time, with
                    reportedly very little loss, before being extracted as heat
                    on demand. This could theoretically be converted back into
                    electricity, although with some energy loss. But Polar Night
                    says that the most efficient method is to just use the heat
                    itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a chilly place like Finland, that means feeding it into
                    the local district heating system, which shares heat
                    produced from industry or energy production through the
                    community. Networks of pipes carry this heat as hot water or
                    steam to warm up houses, buildings, even swimming pools. In
                    this case, the new sand battery would be trialed in the
                    district heating system of the Finnish municipality of
                    Pornainen, run by a company called Loviisan Lämpö.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This new sand battery is expected to stand 13 m (42.7 ft)
                    tall and 15 m (49.2 ft) wide, providing an output power of 1
                    MW and a capacity of 100 MWh. That, the companies claim,
                    equates to a week's worth of Pornainen's heat demands in
                    winter, or a month's worth in summer. By comparison, Polar
                    Night's previous sand battery stands 4 x 7 m (13 x 23 ft),
                    for a nominal power rating of 100 kW and a capacity of 8
                    MWh.

                    Since Broadcom's $61 billion acquisition of VMware closed in
                    November 2023, Broadcom has been charging ahead with major
                    changes to the company's personnel and products. In
                    December, Broadcom began laying off thousands of employees
                    and stopped selling perpetually licensed versions of VMware
                    products, pushing its customers toward more stable and
                    lucrative software subscriptions instead. In January, it
                    ended its partner programs, potentially disrupting sales and
                    service for many users of its products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This week, Broadcom is making a change that is smaller in
                    scale but possibly more relevant for home users of its
                    products: The free version of VMware's vSphere Hypervisor,
                    also known as ESXi,
                    <a href="https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2107518"
                      >is being discontinued</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ESXi is what is known as a "bare-metal hypervisor,"
                    lightweight software that runs directly on hardware without
                    requiring a separate operating system layer in between. ESXi
                    allows you to split a PC's physical resources (CPUs and CPU
                    cores, RAM, storage, networking components, and so on) among
                    multiple virtual machines. ESXi also supports passthrough
                    for PCI, SATA, and USB accessories, allowing guest operating
                    systems direct access to components like graphics cards and
                    hard drives.

                    Microsoft is ending support for its Android subsystem in
                    Windows 11 next year. The software giant first announced it
                    was bringing Android apps to Windows 11 with Amazon's
                    Appstore nearly three years ago, but this Windows Subsystem
                    for Android will now be deprecated starting March 5th, 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Microsoft is ending support for the Windows Subsystem for
                    Android" (WSA), reads a new support document from Microsoft.
                    "As a result, the Amazon Appstore on Windows and all
                    applications and games dependent on WSA will no longer be
                    supported beginning March 5, 2025."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you currently use Android apps from the Amazon Appstore,
                    then you'll continue to have access to these past the
                    support cutoff date, but you won't be able to download any
                    new ones once Microsoft makes its Android subsystem end of
                    life next year. [Since] March 6th [2024], Windows 11 users
                    will no longer be able to search for Amazon Appstore or
                    associated Android apps from the Microsoft Store.

                    In the summer months, the researchers found that healthy
                    colonies paid little attention to the pulse as the bees were
                    too busy foraging for food, caring for their young and
                    maintaining the hive. Other than freezing momentarily when
                    they heard it, the bees' response signal was almost absent
                    as they went about their business. The response signal was
                    stronger as winter arrived and then disappeared again with
                    the warmer spring weather. To the researchers, the winter
                    response indicated that the colony was clustered together
                    for warmth and was healthy.

                  <p>
                    One of the nine colonies the researchers examined developed
                    serious health deterioration and was the only one to
                    consistently exhibit a strong, easily measurable, long-lived
                    buzzing response throughout the summer while the colony was
                    slowly declining. Although they couldn't generalize, the
                    researchers hope this signal might indicate "at least some
                    health disorders, at least in the active season."

                    The third flight test of Starship is targeted to launch
                    Thursday, March 14. The 110-minute test window opens at 7:00
                    a.m. CT (8:00 a.m. ET).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A live webcast of the flight test will begin about 30
                    minutes before liftoff, which you can watch here and on X
                    @SpaceX. As is the case with all developmental testing, the
                    schedule is dynamic and likely to change, so be sure to stay
                    tuned to our X account for updates.

                  <p>
                    Starship's second flight test achieved a number of major
                    milestones and provided invaluable data to continue rapidly
                    developing Starship. Each of these flight tests continue to
                    be just that: a test. They aren't occurring in a lab or on a
                    test stand, but are putting flight hardware in a flight
                    environment to maximize learning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The third flight test aims to build on what we've learned
                    from previous flights while attempting a number of ambitious
                    objectives, including the successful ascent burn of both
                    stages, opening and closing Starship's payload door, a
                    propellant transfer demonstration during the upper stage's
                    coast phase, the first ever re-light of a Raptor engine
                    while in space, and a controlled reentry of Starship. It
                    will also fly a new trajectory, with Starship targeted to
                    splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This new flight path enables
                    us to attempt new techniques like in-space engine burns
                    while maximizing public safety.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This rapid iterative development approach has been the basis
                    for all of SpaceX's major innovative advancements, including
                    Falcon, Dragon, and Starlink. Recursive improvement is
                    essential as we work to build a fully reusable
                    transportation system capable of carrying both crew and
                    cargo to Earth orbit, help humanity return to the Moon, and
                    ultimately travel to Mars and beyond.

                Google's swanky new "Bay View" campus apparently has a major
                problem: bad Wi-Fi.

                  >Reuters reports</a
                >
                that Google's first self-designed office building has "been
                plagued for months by inoperable or, at best, spotty Wi-Fi,
                according to six people familiar with the matter." A Google
                spokesperson
                <a
                  href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/googles-self-designed-office-swallows-wi-fi-like-the-bermuda-triangle/"
                  >confirmed the problems</a
                >
                and said the company is working on fixing them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bay View opened in May 2022. At launch, Google's VP of Real
                Estate &amp; Workplace Services, David Radcliffe, said the site
                "marks the first time we developed one of our own major
                campuses, and the process gave us the chance to rethink the very
                idea of an office." The result is a wild tent-like structure
                with a striking roofline made up of swooping square sections. Of
                course, it's all made of metal and glass, but the roof shape
                looks like squares of cloth held up by poles—each square section
                has high points on the four corners and sags down in the middle.
                The roof is covered in solar cells and collects rainwater while
                also letting in natural light, and Google calls it the "Gradient
                Canopy."

                    According to one AI engineer assigned to the building, which
                    also houses members of the advertising team, the wonky Wi-Fi
                    has been no help for Google pushing a three day per week
                    return-to-office mandate.

                    "You'd think the world's leading internet company would have
                    worked this out," he said. Like others, he spoke to Reuters
                    on the condition of anonymity because Google has not
                    authorized them to talk about work conditions.

                    ChatGPT would produce excerpts of NYT articles. [...] But
                    while defending tactics used to prompt ChatGPT to spout
                    memorized training data—including more than 100 NYT
                    articles—NYT pointed to ChatGPT users who have frequently
                    used the tool to generate entire articles to bypass
                    paywalls.

                  <p>
                    According to the filing, NYT today has no idea how many of
                    its articles were used to train GPT-3 and OpenAI's
                    subsequent AI models, or which specific articles were used,
                    because OpenAI has "not publicly disclosed the makeup of the
                    datasets used to train" its AI models. Rather than setting
                    up a lawsuit, NYT was prompting ChatGPT to discover evidence
                    in attempts to track the full extent of copyright
                    infringement of the tool, NYT argued. [...] "In OpenAI's
                    telling, The Times engaged in wrongdoing by detecting
                    OpenAI's theft of The Times's own copyrighted content,"
                    NYT's court filing said. "OpenAI's true grievance is not
                    about how The Times conducted its investigation, but instead
                    what that investigation exposed: that Defendants built their
                    products by copying The Times's content on an unprecedented
                    scale—a fact that OpenAI does not, and cannot, dispute." On

                    against the paid users of ChatGPT Plus. This time they're
                    taking away Browsing, because it reads the content of a site
                    that the user asks for? Please, that's what I pay for Plus
                    for."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I know it's no use complaining, because OpenAI is going to
                    increasingly 'castrate' ChatGPT 4," the ChatGPT user
                    continued, "but there's my rant."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NYT argued that public reports of users turning to ChatGPT
                    to bypass paywalls "contradict OpenAI's contention that its
                    products have not been used to serve up paywall-protected
                    content, underscoring the need for discovery" in the
                    lawsuit, rather than dismissal.

                    NYT wants a court to not only award damages for profits lost
                    due to ChatGPT's alleged infringement, but also to order a
                    permanent injunction to stop ChatGPT from infringement. A
                    win for NYT could mean that

                    Even when the two sentences had the same meaning, the models
                    were more likely to apply adjectives like "dirty," "lazy,"
                    and "stupid" to speakers of African American English (AAE)
                    than speakers of Standard American English (SAE). The models
                    associated speakers of AAE with less prestigious jobs (or
                    didn't associate them with having a job at all), and when
                    asked to pass judgment on a hypothetical criminal defendant,
                    they were more likely to recommend the death penalty.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An even more notable finding may be a flaw the study
                    pinpoints in the ways that researchers try to solve such
                    biases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To purge models of hateful views, companies like OpenAI,
                    Meta, and Google use feedback training, in which human
                    workers manually adjust the way the model responds to
                    certain prompts. This process, often called "alignment,"
                    aims to recalibrate the millions of connections in the
                    neural network and get the model to conform better with
                    desired values.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The method works well to combat overt stereotypes, and
                    leading companies have employed it for nearly a decade. If
                    users prompted GPT-2, for example, to name stereotypes about
                    Black people, it was likely to list "suspicious," "radical,"
                    and "aggressive," but GPT-4 no longer responds with those
                    associations, according to the paper.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However the method fails on the covert stereotypes that
                    researchers elicited when using African-American English in
                    their study, which was published on
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00742.pdf">arXiv</a> and
                    has not been peer reviewed. That's partially because
                    companies have been less aware of dialect prejudice as an
                    issue, they say. It's also easier to coach a model not to
                    respond to overtly racist questions than it is to coach it
                    not to respond negatively to an entire dialect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Feedback training teaches models to consider their racism,"
                    says Valentin Hofmann, a researcher at the Allen Institute
                    for AI and a coauthor on the paper. "But dialect prejudice
                    opens a deeper level."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Avijit Ghosh, an ethics researcher at Hugging Face who was
                    not involved in the research, says the finding calls into
                    question the approach companies are taking to solve bias.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This alignment—where the model refuses to spew racist
                    outputs—is nothing but a flimsy filter that can be easily
                    broken," he says.

                    For more than 45 years, the Voyager 1 spacecraft has been
                    cruising through the cosmos, crossing the boundary of our
                    solar system to become the first human-made object to
                    venture to interstellar space. Iconic in every regard,
                    Voyager 1 has delivered groundbreaking data on Jupiter and
                    Saturn, and captured the

                    >. But perhaps nothing is lonelier than an aging spacecraft
                    that has lost its ability to communicate while traveling
                    billions of miles away from home.

                    NASA’s Voyager 1 has been glitching for months,
                    <a
                      href="https://gizmodo.com/nasas-voyager-1-spacecraft-is-speaking-gibberish-1851096904"
                      >sending nonsensical data to ground control</a
                    >. Engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have
                    been trying to resolve the issue, but given how far the
                    spacecraft currently is, the process has been extremely
                    slow. Things are looking pretty bleak for the aging mission,
                    which might be nearing the end. Still, NASA isn’t ready to
                    let go of its most distant spacecraft just yet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The team continues information gathering and are preparing
                    some steps that they’re hopeful will get them on a path to
                    either understand the root of the problem and/or solve it,”
                    a JPL spokesperson told Gizmodo in an email.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The anomaly may have something to do with the spacecraft’s
                    flight data system (FDS). FDS collects data from Voyager’s
                    science instruments, as well as engineering data about the
                    health of the spacecraft and combines them into a single
                    package that’s transmitted to Earth through one of the
                    probe’s subsystems, the telemetry modulation unit (TMU), in
                    binary code.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    FDS and TMU, however, may be having trouble communicating
                    with one another. As a result, TMU has been sending data to
                    mission control in a repeating pattern of ones and zeroes.

                    last November. The current board expressed its confidence in
                    the leadership of Altman and President Greg Brockman, and
                    Altman is rejoining the board.<br />[...]<br />The
                    independent review, conducted by law firm
                    <a href="https://www.wilmerhale.com/en">WilmerHale</a>,
                    investigated the circumstances that led to Altman's abrupt
                    removal from the board and his termination as CEO on
                    November 17, 2023. Despite

                      >rumors to the contrary</a
                    >, the board did not fire Altman because they got a peek at
                    scary new AI technology and flinched. "WilmerHale... found
                    that the prior Board's decision did not arise out of
                    concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of
                    development, OpenAI's finances, or its statements to

                  <p>
                    Instead, the review determined that the prior board's
                    actions stemmed from a breakdown in trust between the board
                    and Altman.<br />[...]<br />Altman's surprise firing
                    occurred after he attempted to remove Helen Toner from
                    OpenAI's board due to disagreements over her criticism of
                    OpenAI's approach to AI safety and hype. Some board members

                    "The findings suggest that deep voices evolved in males
                    because our male ancestors frequently interacted with
                    competitors who were strangers, and they show how we can use
                    evolutionary thinking and research from nonhuman animals to
                    predict and understand how our psychology and behaviors vary
                    across social contexts, including cross-culturally," Puts
                    said. "Male traits such as deep voices and beards are highly
                    socially salient, but this new research shows that the
                    salience of at least one of these traits varies in
                    predictable ways across societies, and it suggests that
                    others, such as beards, do too."

                    social perceptions across societies," Puts said. "But it
                    also shows that the extent of our attention to voice pitch
                    when making social attributions is variable across societies
                    and responsive to relevant sociocultural variables. In a
                    society where there's higher relational mobility and you
                    have less direct information about your competitors, people
                    appear to be more attentive to an easily identifiable,
                    recognizable signal like voice pitch."

                    Scientists have solved the mysterious absence of star-shaped
                    dunes from Earth's geological history for the first time,
                    dating one back thousands of years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Star dunes are massive sand dunes that owe their name
                    to arms that spread from a central peak. These sand
                    pyramids, which look like stars when viewed from above, are
                    widespread in modern deserts including sand seas in Africa,
                    Arabia, China, and North America.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research reveals the oldest parts of the base of the
                    Moroccan dune are 13,000 years old. However, the discovery
                    that it formed rapidly in the last thousand years surprised
                    scientists who had thought larger dunes were far older.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Believed to be the tallest dunes on Earth—with one in the
                    Badain Jaran Desert in China reaching 300 meters high—star
                    dunes are also found elsewhere in the solar system, on Mars
                    and on Saturn's moon Titan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite being common today, star dunes have almost never
                    been found in the geological record. Their absence has
                    bemused scientists as past deserts are a common part of the
                    history of Earth, preserved in rocks deep underground.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Published in the journal Scientific Reports, the new study
                    dated the foundations of a star dune in the southeast of
                    Morocco known as Lala Lallia, meaning "highest sacred point"
                    in the Berber language, to about 13,000 years old.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The dune sits in the Erg Chebbi area of the Sahara Desert
                    close to the border with Algeria, an area featured in TV
                    series like SAS Rogue Heroes and blockbuster films such as
                    The Mummy and Sahara.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research shows that the sand pyramid reached its current
                    100-meter height and 700-meter width due to rapid growth in
                    the past thousand years as it shifted slowly to the west.

                    in closer detail.

                    As of Tuesday, the researcher had observed “dozens of
                    thousands of requests” to thousands of unique domains that
                    checked for files uploaded by the visitor browsers. Most
                    files reported 404 web errors, an indication that the login
                    using the guessed password failed. Roughly 0.5 percent of
                    cases returned a 200 response code, leaving open the
                    possibility that password guesses may have been successful.
                    On further inspection, only one of the sites was
                    compromised. The others were using non-standard
                    configurations that returned the 200 response, even for
                    pages that weren’t available.

                    Over a four-day span ending Tuesday, Sinegubko recorded more
                    than 1,200 unique IP addresses that tried to download the
                    credentials file. Of those, five addresses accounted for
                    over 85 percent of the requests:

                    Researchers at Ruhr University Bochum explain how it is
                    possible for the small brains of pigeons, parrots and
                    corvids to perform equally well as those of mammals, despite
                    their significant differences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since the late 19th century, it has been a common belief
                    among researchers that high intelligence requires the high
                    computing capacity of large brains. They also discovered
                    that the cerebral cortex as typical of mammals is necessary
                    to analyze and link information in great detail.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Avian brains, by contrast, are very small and lack any
                    structure resembling a cortex. Nevertheless, scientists
                    showed that parrots and corvids are capable of planning for
                    the future, forging social strategies, recognizing
                    themselves in mirrors and building tools. These and similar
                    aptitudes put them on a par with chimpanzees.<br />...<br />The
                    authors of the study show that birds have developed four
                    similar innovations for intelligence during their evolution,
                    independently of mammals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, birds have many more nerve cells in their small
                    brains than previously believed. Corvids in particular place
                    this extra portion of computing capacity in those areas of
                    the brain that are most important for cognition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second reason is that birds have a specialized brain
                    structure that is similar to the prefrontal cortex in
                    mammals and is crucial for abstraction and planning. This
                    brain region is moreover exceptionally large in intelligent
                    birds and mammals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Third, birds and mammals alike have a system that uses the
                    neurotransmitter dopamine to constantly feedback the quality
                    of their decisions to the prefrontal system. As a result,
                    the prefrontal computational processes continuously adapt to
                    changing situations and the success or failure of the
                    decisions of the individual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, birds have independently developed a very similar
                    working memory to temporarily hold things in short-term
                    memory. Like jugglers who constantly keep many balls
                    spinning in the air, birds and mammals use a flexible
                    activity pattern of their nerve cells to keep a lot of
                    information active at the same time
                  </p>

                It's well known, Americans don't trust Chinese IT hardware.
                Well, guess what?

                Can you blame them? It's got to the point I trust an Arduino -
                that I personally program - far more than anything out there.

                I believe computers also follow the "Peter Principle". Each new
                update becomes more and more encrusted with layers of fix code
                that no matter how fast the CPU runs, or how much memory one
                has, the "attack surface" grows so immense that deliberately
                hiding secret backdoors and "sleeper cell" code makes vetting
                trusted code nearly impossible.

                So the Chinese don't trust American IT. Gee, I don't trust it
                either!
              </p>
              <p>
                I am sure the Chinese are really fed up with all the nebulous
                terms, conditions, disclaimers, hold harmless, copyright
                violation threats, and the risk of being given the Roku
                treatment, with contracts written in such a manner they can be
                changed after payment clears, enforced by code, then forcing
                whatever terms to continue or consider the investment in the
                proprietary technology a sunk cost.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you need it done right, learn to do it yourself, or forever
                be under the control of someone else who does.

                    The dominance of Microsoft software in the enterprise means
                    cloud infrastructure providers often need to accommodate
                    customers' IT estates that inevitably include Office,
                    Windows, and more. That's software Microsoft ensures is
                    cheaper to run on Microsoft's Azure cloud compared to
                    rivals, according to CISPE, hence that group's unhappiness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    CISPE members are similarly upset about the price of service
                    provider license agreements, arguing Microsoft charges
                    double digit percentages more to run SQL Server Enterprise
                    licensing on non-Azure servers. Again, here's a table from
                    CISPE advancing those claims.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These figures are just the tip of the iceberg," Francisco
                    Mingorance, secretary general of CISPE, told
                    <em>The Register</em>. "This data represents
                    <em>prima facie</em> evidence that Microsoft is acting
                    against fair competition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The unjustified feature and pricing discriminations imposed
                    by Microsoft on its dominant software, Office and Windows,
                    outside of Azure, squeeze the margins of rival cloud
                    infrastructure providers, lock in customers and raise
                    prices."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It is clear that there is a straightforward competition
                    case here and that if these unfair licensing practices are
                    not immediately ended by Microsoft voluntarily, legal and
                    regulatory action should swiftly follow," he declared.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The EU anti-trust team and competition authorities at
                    the US Federal Trade Commission are also running
                    investigations into Microsoft's cloudy licensing offers.

                    Intel is on track to receive $3.5 billion in US CHIPS Act

                    that the x86 giant would receive anywhere from $3-$4
                    billion. This funding, siphoned from the overall $39 billion
                    in CHIPS and Science Act allotment,  would presumably
                    support the development of a "secure enclave," which we
                    understand to be a separate production line dedicated to
                    military chip production.

                    the $3.5 billion will be dispersed over the next three
                    years. The news was tucked away in a spending bill passed by
                    the US House of Reps Wednesday, and will cement Intel as the
                    leading producer of silicon for the defense market.

                    Intel is so now the only American chipmaker producing
                    leading edge silicon domestically.

                    My brother and his wife got a house. He mentioned it
                    appeared to have a lot of tech installed by the last owner.
                    I told him that was an exciting mystery for the two of us.
                    Whatever speakers and weird smart home junk had been set up,
                    we'd be able to repurpose. But then he moved in. Slowly,
                    over weeks of tech support calls and hours digging through
                    shockingly deep coat closets, we learned that while the old
                    owner was gone, his digital ghost remained. It was lurking
                    in the home's lights and shades and thermostat, turning what
                    should have been a smart home into a very haunted one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I didn't think I'd have to be the IT equivalent of a
                    Ghostbuster when my brother first texted me about it. I've
                    set up multiple smart homes, worked in IT, and currently am
                    surrounded by some of the smartest tech journalists around.
                    As smart home troubleshooting resources go, I have more than
                    the average person.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was no problem walking him through maximizing the
                    performance of the Google Nest Wifi system still in place
                    (including a full factory reset). But then... the trouble
                    started. There were the window shades that always opened at
                    8AM and always closed at sundown. My brother disconnected
                    everything that looked like a hub, and still, operating on
                    some inaccessible internal clock, the shades carried on as
                    they were once programmed to do.
                  </p>

                    [...] Some former homeowners will provide onboarding to the
                    home's smart home system, but most do as the guy who used to
                    own my brother's house did. They walk away and leave it as
                    an adventure for the next person. I know because I've now
                    done it twice myself. I really hope the new renters of my
                    old Brooklyn walk-up appreciate all the 2014 Philips Hue
                    lights I left installed in the basement.

                  kidnappers and pedophiles</a
                >. It's also fueled fears of a 'privacy nightmare' at a time
                when abortion is criminalized:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    The alleged pedophile "LuvEmYoung" had worked to stay
                    anonymous in the chatrooms where he bragged about sexually
                    abusing children. A criminal affidavit said he covered his
                    tracks by using TeleGuard, an encrypted Swiss messaging app,
                    to share a video of himself last month with a sleeping
                    4-year-old boy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the FBI had a new strategy. A foreign law enforcement
                    officer got TeleGuard to hand over a small string of code
                    the company had used to send push alerts — the pop-up
                    notifications that announce instant messages and news
                    updates — to the suspect's phone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An FBI agent then got Google to quickly hand over a list of
                    email addresses this month linked to that code, known as a
                    "push token," and traced one account to a man in Toledo, an
                    affidavit shows. The man, Michael Aspinwall, was charged
                    with sexual exploitation of minors and distribution of child
                    pornography and arrested within a week of the Google
                    request.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The breakthrough relied on a little-known quirk of push
                    alerts, a basic staple of modern phones: Those tokens can be
                    used to identify users and are stored on servers run by
                    Apple and Google, which can hand them over at law
                    enforcement's request.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The data has become prized evidence for federal
                    investigators, who have used push tokens in at least four
                    cases across the country to arrest suspects in cases related
                    to child sexual abuse material and a kidnapping that led to
                    murder, according to a Washington Post review of court
                    records. And law enforcement officials have defended the
                    technique by saying they use court-authorized legal
                    processes that give officers a vital tool they need to hunt
                    down criminals.

                    Spokesperson Ellen Aarts had a statement on tap for local
                    media on Wednesday: "At 0130 last night, the alarms went off
                    in Duvel's IT department because ransomware had been
                    detected. Production was therefore immediately stopped. It
                    is not yet known when it could start again. We hope today or
                    tomorrow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our IT department immediately intervened and is currently
                    still mapping everything out. They are looking for a
                    solution as quickly as possible."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Other manufacturing organizations hit by ransomware
                    often aren't so lucky and any kind of downtime can be
                    operationally and financially damaging.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's why the industry is such a common target for ransomware
                    miscreants since they know that theoretically, manufacturers
                    are more motivated to pay ransoms quickly, minimizing costly
                    downtime.

                    A 2.9-ton cargo pallet, once used for a critical battery
                    upgrade mission on the International Space Station (ISS), is
                    now approaching the end of its journey and is expected to

                    The pallet, tossed from the ISS in March 2021 by the trusty
                    Canadarm2, is facing imminent destruction in Earth’s
                    atmosphere three years after serving its purpose in a major
                    battery replacement project on the station. According to
                    Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer Jonathan McDowell, the pallet
                    “will not totally burn up on reentry—about half a ton of
                    fragments will likely hit the Earth’s surface,” McDowell

                    Veterinary scientists seem to have unraveled a mystery about
                    why certain dogs simply can’t ever get enough to eat. In
                    research out this week, they found evidence that a common
                    mutation in Labrador retrievers causes them to experience
                    greater hunger than usual while also reducing their
                    metabolic rate, both of which make the dogs predisposed to
                    obesity. The findings might help better understand and treat
                    obesity in both dogs and their owners.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Labradors are one of the most popular dog breeds in the
                    world, treasured for their playful energy and their
                    adeptness as a working dog (they’re often used as service
                    dogs). But while labs do live relatively long lives—about 13
                    years on average—they’re also known to have a ravenous
                    appetite and accordingly high rates of obesity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Labs aren’t alone in their plight: Much like humans, dogs in
                    general are experiencing higher rates of obesity. University
                    of Cambridge scientist Eleanor Raffan has been working to
                    unpack the genetics of obesity and metabolic disease in
                    dogs. Her team has especially focused on the Labrador
                    retriever, given its reputation for obesity, and its close
                    relative the flat-coated retriever.

                to take open source licensing past the apparent stalling point
                it has reached on its way towards software freedom. As he noted
                earlier, current licenses are not meeting that goal and
                businesses have either found loophole or just plain been allowed
                to ignore the licensing. A move more towards a contract is
                needed.

                  <p>
                    At the link below is the first draft of the Post-Open
                    License. This is not yet the product of a qualified
                    attorney, and you shouldn't apply it to your own work yet.
                    There isn't context for this license yet, so some things
                    won't make sense: for example the license is administered by
                    an entity called the "POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION" and I
                    haven't figured out how to structure that organization so
                    that people can trust it. There are probably also terms I
                    can't get away with legally, this awaits work with a lawyer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because the license attempts to handle very many problems
                    that have arisen with Open Source licensing, it's big. It's
                    approaching the size of AGPL3, which I guess is a metric for
                    a relatively modern license, since AGPL3 is now 17 years old

                    Microsoft's AI text-to-image generator, Copilot Designer,
                    appears to be heavily filtering outputs after a Microsoft
                    engineer, Shane Jones, warned that Microsoft has ignored
                    warnings that the tool randomly creates violent and sexual
                    imagery, CNBC
                    <a
                      href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/06/microsoft-ai-engineer-says-copilot-designer-creates-disturbing-images.html"

                  <p>
                    Jones told CNBC that he repeatedly warned Microsoft of the
                    alarming content he was seeing while volunteering in
                    red-teaming efforts to test the tool's vulnerabilities.
                    Microsoft failed to take the tool down or implement
                    safeguards in response, Jones said, or even post disclosures
                    to change the product's rating to mature in the Android
                    store.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Bloomberg also reviewed Jones' letter and
                    <a
                      href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-06/microsoft-staffer-warns-lawmakers-ftc-about-harmful-ai-content"
                      >reported</a
                    >
                    that Jones told the FTC that while Copilot Designer is
                    currently marketed as safe for kids, it's randomly
                    generating an "inappropriate, sexually objectified image of
                    a woman in some of the pictures it creates." And it can also
                    be used to generate "harmful content in a variety of other
                    categories, including: political bias, underage drinking and
                    drug use, misuse of corporate trademarks and copyrights,
                    conspiracy theories, and religion to name a few."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Jones' tests also found that Copilot Designer would
                    easily violate copyrights, producing images of Disney
                    characters, including Mickey Mouse or Snow White. Most
                    problematically, Jones could politicize Disney characters
                    with the tool, generating images of Frozen's main character,
                    Elsa, in the Gaza Strip or "wearing the military uniform of
                    the Israel Defense Forces."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ars was able to generate interpretations of Snow White, but
                    Copilot Designer rejected multiple prompts politicizing
                    Elsa.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If Microsoft has updated the automated content filters, it's
                    likely due to Jones protesting his employer's decisions.
                    [...] Jones has suggested that Microsoft would need to
                    substantially invest in its safety team to put in place the
                    protections he'd like to see. He reported that the Copilot
                    team is already buried by complaints, receiving "more than
                    1,000 product feedback messages every day." Because of this
                    alleged understaffing, Microsoft is currently only
                    addressing "the most egregious issues," Jones told CNBC.

                    Their findings add to a growing body of evidence that some
                    introduced species including these feral parrots can
                    experience rapid niche shifts beyond what appears to be
                    possible in the forested regions of northern Mexico they
                    evolved in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Artificial irrigation may close the gap between
                    native and introduced climates," the study suggests,
                    "allowing more year-round vegetation in Southern California
                    cities than expected given its natural precipitation
                    levels."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That "urban oasis effect" created by sprinkler watering
                    systems "could partly explain why introduced parrots do not
                    seem to be spreading beyond urban centers," it says. "Their
                    intelligence and behavioral plasticity might further allow
                    them to adapt to urban life."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The look of Southern California's green canopies has changed
                    significantly since the 1950s and '60s, when developers
                    turned up their noses at native oaks and sycamores. They
                    chose instead to landscape their subdivisions, apartment
                    complexes, business parks, shopping centers and roadways
                    with nonnative trees, including sweet gums, camphor,
                    carrotwood, fig, and ficus trees—all favored by parrots.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Red-crowned parrots, whose home range is restricted to
                    the lowlands of northeast Mexico, were first recorded in the
                    Los Angeles area in 1963. Since then, the population has
                    swelled to more than 3,000 birds, the study says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The number of lilac-crowned parrots, which are endemic to

                    Given that both species are considered endangered in their
                    home ranges in Mexico due to habitat loss and trapping for
                    the pet trade, local established flocks have become prized
                    for their conservation potential.

                    [...] The proposed final judgment, which still has to be
                    agreed to by the judge in the case, fully accepts Nintendo's
                    stated position that "Yuzu is primarily designed to
                    circumvent [Nintendo's copy protection] and play Nintendo
                    Switch games" by "using unauthorized copies of Nintendo

                    "ordinary course" of the average Yuzu user's experience may
                    have been an uphill battle in court. Nintendo argued in its
                    lawsuit that "the vast majority of Yuzu users are using Yuzu
                    to play downloaded pirated games in Yuzu," a fact that could
                    have played against the emulator maker at trial even if
                    non-infringing uses for the emulator do exist.

                    emulators for defunct systems that are no longer selling new

                    [...] The widespread interest in the impact hypothesis
                    outside academia can appear difficult to understand, says
                    Tristan Sturm, a geographer at Queen's University Belfast,
                    who studies apocalyptic narratives and conspiracy theories.
                    "Archaeology is not a superpopular topic," he points out.
                    Nor does grasping the truth about the impact hypothesis have
                    obvious importance for the average person.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] More broadly, the hypothesis' fringe status appeals to
                    those who are experiencing what Sturm calls "conspiracism,"
                    the reflexive distrust of authority figures, including
                    politicians, journalists and, increasingly, scientists. A
                    tendency toward conspiracism does not necessarily mean
                    someone subscribes to actual conspiracy theories, Sturm
                    says; rather, it is a gap in the epistemological immune
                    system through which conspiracy theories enter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the course of publishing this work, though, members
                    of the Comet Research Group say they have encountered signs
                    that their opponents have moved from simply voicing
                    skepticism to actively trying to suppress their research.
                    Despite receiving several favorable peer reviews on a paper
                    submitted to a scientific journal, group leaders told me,
                    the journal's editor summarily rejected it. In response,
                    they started their own scientific journal, called Airbursts
                    and Cratering Impacts, whose editors include West and two
                    other Comet Research Group members. All three assured me
                    that submissions to the journal are peer-reviewed according
                    to the usual best practices; so far, the journal has
                    published six papers from the group.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I began to wonder if, in trying to draw connections between
                    the various oddities that swirled around the Comet Research
                    Group, Boslough was himself falling into a kind of
                    conspiratorial thinking. "I have indeed asked myself that
                    question," he told me. But after careful consideration, he
                    had concluded that he was not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Comet Research Group members predicted to me that skeptics
                    like Boslough could never be persuaded, only waited out.
                    "You know that old saying," West told me. " 'Science
                    advances one funeral at a time.'" During one of my
                    conversations with him, I asked — as I did of nearly
                    everyone I spoke with, on both sides of the issue — whether
                    he ever harbored any doubts. Was there any kind of evidence
                    that might convince him that he was wrong?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a sense, what West and his collaborators think now hardly
                    matters. The hypothesis has already penetrated deeply, and
                    perhaps indelibly, into the public imagination, seemingly on
                    its way to becoming less a matter of truth than a matter of
                    personal and group identity.

                    [...] One concrete example: My team built a machine learning
                    algorithm to predict moral outrage expressions on Twitter.
                    It works really well. It does as well as showing a tweet to
                    a human and asking, "Is this person outraged or not?" In
                    order to train that algorithm, we showed a bunch of tweets
                    to human participants and asked them to say whether this
                    tweet contained outrage. Because we have that ground truth
                    of human perception, we can be reasonably certain that our
                    tool is doing what we want it to do.

                    [...] Once you have multiple models interacting which are
                    not interpretable and might be making errors in a systematic
                    way that you are not able to recognize, that's where we
                    start to get into dangerous territory. Legal scholar
                    <a
                      href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c"

                    has called this concept "intellectual debt": As soon as you
                    have multiple systems interacting in a complex environment,
                    you can very quickly get to a point where there are errors
                    propagating through the system, but you don't know where
                    they originate because each individual system is not
                    interpretable to the scientists.

                    [...] So much of the discourse around AI pushes this message
                    of inevitability: that AI is here, it is not going away,
                    it's inevitable that this is going to bring us to a bright
                    future and solve all our problems. That message is coming
                    from people who stand to make a lot of money from AI and its
                    uptake all across society, including science. But we decide
                    when and how we are going to use AI tools in our work. This
                    is not inevitable. We just need to be really careful that
                    these tools serve us. We're not saying that they can't.
                    We're just adamant that we need to educate ourselves in the
                    ways that AI introduces epistemic risk to the production of
                    scientific knowledge. Scientists working alone are not going
                    to engineer our way out of those risks.

                    In a groundbreaking discovery, bumblebees have been shown to
                    possess a previously unseen level of cognitive
                    sophistication. A new study, published in Nature, reveals
                    that these fuzzy pollinators can learn complex, multi-step
                    tasks through social interaction, even if they cannot figure
                    them out on their own. This challenges the long-held belief
                    that such advanced social learning is unique to humans, and
                    even hints at the presence of key elements of cumulative
                    culture in these insects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Led by Dr. Alice Bridges and Professor Lars Chittka , the
                    research team designed a two-step puzzle box requiring
                    bumblebees to perform two distinct actions in sequence to
                    access a sweet reward at the end. Training bees to do this
                    was no easy task, and bees had to be helped along by the
                    addition of an extra reward along the way. This temporary
                    reward was eventually taken away, and bees subsequently had
                    to open the whole box before getting their treat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Surprisingly, while individual bees struggled to solve the
                    puzzle when starting from scratch, those allowed to observe
                    a trained "demonstrator" bee readily learned the entire
                    sequence—even the first step—while only getting a reward at
                    the end.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This study demonstrates that bumblebees possess a level of
                    social learning previously thought to be exclusive to
                    humans. They can share and acquire behaviors that are beyond
                    their individual cognitive capabilities: an ability thought
                    to underpin the expansive, complex nature of human culture,
                    and one previously thought to be exclusive to us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr. Bridges says, "This is an extremely difficult task for
                    bees. They had to learn two steps to get the reward, with
                    the first behavior in the sequence being unrewarded. We
                    initially needed to train demonstrator bees with a temporary
                    reward included there, highlighting the complexity."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Yet, other bees learned the whole sequence from social
                    observation of these trained bees, even without ever
                    experiencing the first step's reward. But when we let other
                    bees attempt to open the box without a trained bee to
                    demonstrate the solution, they didn't manage to open any at
                    all."
