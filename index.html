              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Plastics are now omnipresent in our daily lives. The
                    existence of microplastics (1 µm to 5 mm in length) and
                    possibly even nanoplastics (&lt;1 μm) has recently raised
                    health concerns. In particular, nanoplastics are believed to
                    be more toxic since their smaller size renders them much
                    more amenable, compared to microplastics, to enter the human
                    body.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, detecting nanoplastics imposes tremendous
                    analytical challenges on both the nano-level sensitivity and
                    the plastic-identifying specificity, leading to a knowledge
                    gap in this mysterious nanoworld surrounding us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To address these challenges, we developed a hyperspectral
                    stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging platform with an
                    automated plastic identification algorithm that allows
                    micro-nano plastic analysis at the single-particle level
                    with high chemical specificity and throughput. We first
                    validated the sensitivity enhancement of the narrow band of
                    SRS to enable high-speed single nanoplastic detection below
                    100 nm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We then devised a data-driven spectral matching algorithm to
                    address spectral identification challenges imposed by
                    sensitive narrow-band hyperspectral imaging and achieve
                    robust determination of common plastic polymers. With the
                    established technique, we studied the micro-nano plastics
                    from bottled water as a model system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We successfully detected and identified nanoplastics from
                    major plastic types. Micro-nano plastics concentrations were
                    estimated to be about 2.4 ± 1.3 × 10<sup>5</sup> particles
                    per liter of bottled water, about 90% of which are
                    nanoplastics. This is orders of magnitude more than the
                    microplastic abundance reported previously in bottled water.
                    High-throughput single-particle counting revealed
                    extraordinary particle heterogeneity and nonorthogonality
                    between plastic composition and morphologies; the resulting
                    multidimensional profiling sheds light on the science of
                    nanoplastics.

                    Most of us are familiar with yawn contagion, which is the
                    act of spontaneous yawning when someone nearby yawns, often
                    but not always audibly. For humans, yawning can emanate from
                    fatigue or boredom, and either seeing or hearing someone
                    else yawn may start a chain reaction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many animal species also yawn when they're tired, and yawn
                    contagion is known to occur among various social animals
                    including certain apes, monkeys, lemurs, pigs, wolves,
                    domestic dogs, lions, spotted hyenas, and more. But other
                    than humans, only one species—the gelada (Theropithecus
                    gelada), a species of Old World monkey—is known to yawn
                    audibly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Earlier studies have explored yawn contagion within and
                    between various species; for example, some work has shown
                    that dogs will yawn in response to the sound of human yawns.
                    But to date, there have been no known studies on
                    intraspecific audibly-triggered yawn contagion in a
                    non-human species.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now a research team from France and Italy has specifically
                    studied how the sound of gelada yawns affects their
                    conspecifics. The team's work is
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-49797-5"
                      >published</a
                    >
                    in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Geladas, also known as bleeding-heart monkeys, are endemic
                    to Ethiopia. They live in multi-level societies that include
                    units, teams, bands, and communities. Core units either
                    include a single reproductive adult male with multiple adult
                    females, their young, and at least one follower male; or

                    Similar to humans, geladas enjoy rich and complex vocal
                    communication. According to the new study, "A similar
                    evolutionary social landscape, with similar challenges
                    (e.g., need of group coordination with subjects not always
                    in visual contact), has indeed possibly led to the emergence
                    of multimodal communication in both species."

                  <p>
                    Existing findings show that yawning geladas, mostly males,
                    emit a loud vocal sound that does not arise solely from
                    inhaling and exhaling. While the researchers behind this
                    study knew that visually-based yawn contagion could affect
                    geladas, they wanted to find out whether the sound of
                    yawning without a visual cue would result in a similar
                    effect.

                    Traditionally, scientists believed that isotopic effects in
                    biochemical reactions were more or less proportional to the
                    mass difference between isotopes. For instance, a 0.5% mass
                    difference between normal and ultralight enzymes (molecules
                    with depleted heavy isotopes <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>2</sup>H,
                    <sup>15</sup>N, and <sup>18</sup>O) should yield a kinetic
                    effect of no more than 1%.

                    Indian billionaire and Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy
                    has doubled down on his comments that India’s youth should
                    voluntarily work 70-hour weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Murthy’s first call for very long working hours came in

                    2023, when he called on the nation’s youth to work long
                    hours out of a sense of duty to the nation. He suggested the
                    young “work twelve-hour days for the next 20 years, 50 years
                    whatever it is.“
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new interview posted this week,
                    <em>India Today</em> consulting editor Rajdeep Sardesai
                    asked Murthy if he sticks by his 70-hour plan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Absolutely,” he answered. “I don’t think 70 is important,
                    all that it means is that you are productive, work very hard
                    like the Germans did after World War II, like Japanese did.
                    We owe it to the poor people to work hard and make the
                    quality of their life a little bit better.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Narayana Murthy said he doesn’t really have regrets
                    over missing important events in his children’s lives as he
                    “always believed quality was more important than quantity.”
                    He detailed he would leave for the office at 06:00, return
                    around 21:15, expect his kids to be ready at the gate on his
                    arrival, whereupon all would jump in the car and grab dinner
                    together.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “We used to have lots of fun during that time. That hour and
                    a half, two hours were the most relaxing for the children,”
                    said Murthy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Infosys co-founder described his long hours at
                    work as a “puny” effort compared to the accomplishments of
                    India's historical leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, other
                    heroes of India’s independence movement, and the nation’s
                    early prime ministers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “So we should not even make this a big deal," he commented.
                    He added that Mahatma Gandhi hardly ever saw his children.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “All the extraordinary heroes, if I could do one millionth
                    of what they did, I think our family would be happy, I would
                    be happy,” the former exec said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And as we noted when we covered Murthy’s first remarks
                    about 70-hour weeks, requiring employees to work such hours
                    appears to be illegal under Indian law.

                    Companies increasingly turn to popular social media
                    personalities to promote their brands, products, and
                    services. The influencer marketing economy was valued at
                    $21.1 billion in 2023, and more than 90% of brands enlist
                    influencers with a small audience (micro) or with massive
                    reach (macro) to connect with consumers and achieve a
                    variety of marketing goals, from creating awareness to
                    increasing sales.

                  <p>
                    Influencers have the potential to diffuse marketing messages
                    and drive actions, but it is unclear why some of their posts
                    get a lot of engagement while others do not. One possibility
                    is that consumers are increasingly aware that influencers
                    get paid to promote products, raising questions about their
                    motives. Additionally, anecdotal evidence suggests that when
                    influencers use high-arousal language (e.g., "it's totally
                    amazing!"), it leads to questions about their
                    trustworthiness, which in turn leads consumers to engage
                    less with the content.

                  <p>
                    Consumers typically see micro influencers as regular people,
                    so if they say something like "this shake is AMAZING!"
                    consumers believe they really are excited about that shake
                    and just want to share this discovery with their friends and
                    followers. This belief in their sincerity increases
                    consumers' trust in micro influencers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, macro influencers do not seem like regular people.
                    Consumers know these influencers receive substantial sums to
                    say positive things about products, so they judge their
                    posts as an attempt to persuade, just like any other form of
                    advertising. Believing that someone has manipulative
                    intentions tends to decrease trust. Yet the negative effect
                    of high arousal posts by macro influencers could be
                    mitigated if their posts offer more informative (vs.
                    commercial) content or if the messages are more balanced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This research underscores the importance of aligning
                    social media posts and language arousal strategies depending
                    on the type of influencer. For micro influencers, using
                    high-arousal language authentically can enhance engagement,
                    but macro influencers should focus more on informative
                    content to maintain their trustworthiness.

                    Vulnerabilities have been discovered in Bluetooth technology
                    that affect various operating systems. As Linux admins,
                    infosec professionals, Internet security enthusiasts, and
                    sysadmins, it is crucial to understand the implications of
                    these vulnerabilities and the impact they may have on our
                    work. Let's have a closer look at these flaws, how they
                    work, their impact on Linux users, and how to mitigate your
                    risk.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers have discovered zero-click Bluetooth flaws that
                    enable attackers to secretly pair with devices as keyboards
                    and inject keystrokes without user interaction. The
                    vulnerabilities affect Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and
                    Windows, posing a serious threat to billions of devices
                    worldwide. Bluetooth technologies power wireless keyboards,
                    mice, game controllers, and other peripherals used by
                    billions of devices around the globe, highlighting the
                    widespread nature of these vulnerabilities and the potential
                    for malicious actors to exploit them across various
                    platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Linux Bluetooth implementation allows keyboards to
                    initiate pairing without authentication or user confirmation
                    (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45866"
                      >CVE-2023-45866</a
                    >). This means that an attacker could remotely pair as a
                    Bluetooth keyboard and inject keystrokes without the user's
                    knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The implications of these vulnerabilities are significant.
                    They expose a potential attack vector that could compromise
                    a wide range of devices. For Linux admins, it highlights the
                    importance of keeping Bluetooth settings secure and applying
                    the available patch in BlueZ.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Infosec professionals and sysadmins must be aware of the
                    vulnerabilities within their respective operating systems
                    and take necessary measures to mitigate the risks, such as
                    <a href="https://linuxsecurity.com/advisories"
                      >promptly applying patches</a
                    >
                    as they are released by their distribution(s). Additionally,
                    it raises questions about the overall security of Bluetooth
                    technology and the need for cryptographic authentication and
                    consent for all pairing attempts.

                    The last commercial supersonic jet, the Concorde, last flew
                    over two decades ago, in 2003. It only traveled
                    supersonically across the Atlantic Ocean, and while cutting
                    international travel time in half while cruising at some
                    1,350 mph, it ultimately failed economically. The plane's
                    route was limited — because it couldn't fly over land. But
                    that was only part of the problem.

                    "They didn't have enough customers, because of high ticket
                    prices," the Smithsonian's van der Linden explained. "The
                    high ticket prices were caused by the very high fuel
                    consumption." (A

                    NASA's QueSST mission won't address the fuel that supersonic
                    engines gulp. Airplane makers, and airlines, will almost
                    certainly need to bring fuel costs down to even attract
                    customers that can currently afford the highest-priced,
                    first class-type seating.

                    airline, they'll park it."

                    A Northwestern University team has demonstrated a remarkable
                    new way to generate electricity, with a paperback-sized
                    device that nestles in soil and harvests power created as
                    microbes break down dirt – for as long as there's carbon in
                    the soil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microbial fuel cells, as they're called, have been around
                    for more than 100 years. They work a little like a battery,
                    with an anode, cathode and electrolyte – but rather than
                    drawing electricity from chemical sources, they work with
                    bacteria that naturally donate electrons to nearby
                    conductors as they chow down on soil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The issue thus far has been keeping them supplied with water
                    and oxygen, while being buried in the dirt. "Although MFCs
                    have existed as a concept for more than a century, their
                    unreliable performance and low output power have stymied
                    efforts to make practical use of them, especially in
                    low-moisture conditions," said UNW alumnus and project lead
                    Bill Yen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, the team set about creating several new designs targeted
                    at giving the cells continual access to oxygen and water –
                    and found success with a design shaped like a cartridge
                    sitting vertically on a horizontal disc. The disc-shaped
                    carbon felt anode lies horizontally at the bottom of the
                    device, buried deep in the soil where it can capture
                    electrons as microbes digest dirt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The conductive metal cathode, meanwhile, sits vertically on
                    top of the anode. The bottom part thus sits deep enough to
                    have access to moisture from the deep soil, while the top
                    sits flush with the surface. A fresh air gap runs down the
                    whole length of the electrode, and a protective cap on top
                    stops dirt and debris from falling in and cutting off the
                    cathode's access to oxygen. Part of the cathode is also
                    coated with a waterproofing material, so that when it
                    floods, there's still a hydrophobic section of the cathode
                    in touch with oxygen to keep the fuel cell running.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In testing, this design performed consistently across
                    different soil moisture levels, from completely underwater
                    to "somewhat dry," with just 41% water by volume in the

                    In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the loss of the
                    only gene copy of CPR5 results in a broad spectrum of
                    resistance to viruses, bacteria, and fungi. However, growth
                    is severely restricted; the plants exhibit spontaneous
                    lesions and produce low yields. So, it was important to test
                    whether rymv2 resistance could be transferred to other rice
                    varieties without negative consequences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Africa, other high-yield rice varieties based on the
                    Asian species Oryza indica are mainly used, and these do not
                    have the resistance gene. Inserting the relevant gene is,
                    however, not a particularly promising approach as the
                    descendants of such "inter-species" hybrids are highly
                    sterile and, therefore, cannot reproduce and pass on the
                    resistance easily.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using the CRISPR/Cas genome editing method, the research
                    group has now shown that mutations of the RYMV2 gene can be
                    produced in an Asian rice variety that make it resistant to
                    the virus in a similar way to the African form. In the next
                    step, the aim is to edit relevant African elite varieties in
                    the same way to make them available to African small-scale
                    producers. Helping these farmers is the goal of the
                    international research consortium "Healthy Crops," which is
                    headed by HHU.

                    In December 2023, Nikon, Sony, and Canon announced their bid
                    to keep photographers and videographers safe from
                    misattribution and deepfakes of their work. Aside from just
                    watermarking their images, these camera manufacturers have
                    proposed the use of digital signatures as the new global
                    standard for media professionals. Although, ordinary
                    photographers, videographers, and other hobbyists, can also
                    stand to benefit from these efforts.
                  </p>

                      >Nikkei</a
                    >, these three Japanese brands hold a whopping 84.3% global
                    market share for the camera industry, which includes
                    everything from compact cameras to higher-end DLSRs. After a
                    15.2% decrease in sales in the last year, it's no wonder
                    that they're leading the charge to fight against
                    AI-generated images and working to protect their customers.

                  <p>
                    For Sony camera users, you can expect a firmware update for
                    existing mirrorless cameras. On the other hand, Nikon and
                    Canon users will have to wait a little longer for succeeding
                    models for the digital signature feature. Although Canon
                    plans to reward their users with some additional features,
                    such as a built-in authentication feature with video
                    watermarking in 2024.

                    The ULTRA-LUX project, led by technology company Imec, has
                    developed a new type of light-emitting diode (LED) – known
                    as perovskite LEDs (PeLED) – that might one day consign OLED

                    Researchers with the ULTRA-LUX project, however, have
                    wielded the potential of perovskite – a class of material
                    with a specialized crystal structure – to serve as the
                    semiconductor in LED-based displays. In doing so, they've
                    created a display technology that can be up to 1000 times
                    brighter than state-of-the-art OLEDs, according to research
                    published in Nature.

                    This material, which is used in solar-powered cells, can
                    withstand very high current densities, but hasn't been used
                    in such a way as to emit light in a display. Using their
                    architecture, Imec demonstrated the potential of PeLEDs in
                    future displays, and the researchers now plan on building
                    one.

                    see displays on the market powered by this kind of display
                    technology, given there's a fair amount of research and
                    engineering still to be done.

                    new age of cost savings. Their thinking: why pay six
                    employees when you could pay one to oversee customers at
                    self-service registers, as they do their own labour of

                    While self-checkout technology has its theoretical selling
                    points for both consumers and businesses, it mostly isn't
                    living up to expectations. Customers are still queueing.
                    They need store employees to help clear kiosk errors or
                    check their identifications for age-restricted items. Stores
                    still need to have workers on-hand to help them, and to
                    service the machines.

                    The technology is, in some cases, more trouble than it's

                    [...] Many retail companies have invested millions – if not
                    billions – of dollars in self-checkout technology, which
                    Andrews says was first developed during the 1980s, and
                    started appearing in stores in the 1990s. They're not
                    exactly cheap to get into stores: some experts estimate a
                    four-kiosk system can run six figures.

                    of self-checkout technology is that, in many cases, it
                    simply doesn't lead to the cost savings businesses hoped

                    However ubiquitous the technology is, and however much
                    consumers get used to using the kiosks, shoppers are likely

                    [...] According to the TU Darmstadt researchers, Apple has
                    known since at least 2019 that AirDrop leaks the real-world
                    identities of users. To this day, however, Apple has never
                    publicly discussed or acknowledged any aspect of the
                    leakage, including whether the company has plans to replace
                    AirDrop's hash-based PSI with a more secure PSI, such as one
                    devised by the researchers. Apple representatives didn't
                    respond to an email Thursday asking once again if it was
                    aware of the leakage and if it has any plans to plug it.

                    [...] For now, there's nothing AirDrop users can do to
                    prevent their phone number and email address from being
                    leaked, short of configuring the feature to "receiving off"
                    and never initiating a send. Any protection beyond that will
                    require the active participation of Apple, which so far has
                    maintained radio silence on the topic.

                    that is likely to be as much of a <em>political</em> problem

                    Protests in China have attracted international attention as
                    the greatest challenge of President Xi Jinping's premiership
                    and a major knock to the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP)

                    AirDrop, which allows users to share content between Apple
                    devices, has become an important tool in protestors' efforts
                    to circumvent authoritarian censorship regimes over recent
                    years.

                    That is because it relies on wireless connections between
                    phones, rather than internet connectivity, placing it beyond
                    the scope of internet content moderators. It uses Bluetooth

                    after someone who received some unreleased
                    <em>Magic</em> cards in error, the company appears to have
                    taken a draconian turn in recent years. Then, over the
                    summer, there was a bunch of backlash when WotC was found to
                    have included art from one of its artists that had been

                    in one of its books. After that whole fiasco, WotC publicly
                    swore off using any art in its products that was not 100%
                    human created.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And it’s important to note that this is a huge thing in the
                    D&amp;D and <em>Magic</em> worlds. The books, cards, and
                    associated items that players and fans buy from these games
                    have always been revered in part for the fantastic art that
                    has come along with them. And the artists contributing to
                    them have been equally celebrated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, when sharp-eyed observers of recent promotional art that
                    came out for <em>Magic</em> pointed out it sure looked like
                    the images <em>around</em> the cards showed signs of having
                    been generated by AI, well, WotC

                  <p>
                    [...] But the real lesson here is that companies have to be
                    very careful with this sort of thing. The internet has
                    enough well-trained Sherlocks out there who are holding
                    companies to their word, looking for anywhere where AI
                    generated content is being snuck in to replace human-made
                    content that, as the technology stands today, there’s a good
                    chance any such uses will be found out. They might as well
                    save themselves the trouble and just make sure the humans
                    are doing the work.

                    America's greenhouse gas emissions fell 1.9 percent in 2023,
                    in large part because the burning of coal to produce
                    electricity plummeted to its lowest level in half a century,
                    according to estimates published on Wednesday by the Rhodium
                    Group, a nonpartisan research firm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The drop means that United States emissions have now fallen
                    roughly 17.2 percent since 2005. There was a huge, anomalous
                    dip in planet-warming pollution at the start of the
                    coronavirus pandemic, when large segments of the economy
                    shut down, followed by a sharp rebound in the following two
                    years once activity resumed. But over the longer term,
                    America's emissions have been trending downward as power
                    plants and cars have gotten cleaner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the decline in emissions to date hasn't been nearly
                    steep enough to meet the nation's goals for trying to slow
                    global warming. President Biden wants to reduce America's
                    greenhouse gas emissions at least 50 percent below 2005
                    levels by 2030. To hit that goal, annual emissions would
                    have to fall more than three times as fast for the rest of
                    the decade as they did last year, the report found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers looked at planet-warming emissions generated
                    by transportation, electricity, industry and buildings but
                    did not include pollution from agriculture, which accounts
                    for roughly 10 percent of the nation's greenhouse gases.

                    they enjoy significant economic growth, a study last year

                    But globally, carbon dioxide emissions still soared to
                    record levels last year, driven in large part by an increase
                    in fossil fuel use in China, India and other fast-growing
                    countries.

                    as opposed to the pre-rendered demos that are often more
                    common in such cases. But the startup automaker has had
                    anything but an easy time since then. Yesterday, it
                    announced its Q4 2023 deliveries ahead of an investor call
                    in late February, and the numbers are bad.

                    Lucid originally planned to launch the Air sedan in 2019.
                    Designed by Tesla's former VP and Chief Vehicle Engineer
                    Peter Rawlinson, together with designer Derek Jenkins, the
                    Air aimed for Mercedes-Benz S-Class levels of space and
                    luxury on the interior but with the footprint of the smaller
                    Mercedes E-Class. Under its

                  <p>
                    But starting a new car company is neither easy nor cheap.
                    Lucid struggled to obtain funding until Saudi Arabia's
                    sovereign wealth fund
                    <a

                    in 2018, allowing Lucid to complete work on its factory in
                    Arizona and push on with developing the Air.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But those big numbers were matched by an equally big
                    price—$169,000, or $139,000 for the slightly less powerful,
                    slightly shorter-range Air Grand Touring.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since then, the company added some cheaper variants to
                    its lineup—Lucid will sell you an Air Pure for $74,000 after
                    its current incentives are taken into account. But that
                    hasn't resulted in a glut of orders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the last three months of 2023, Lucid built just 2,231
                    Air EVs and delivered 1,734 of those to customers. The
                    results for the whole year weren't any better—Lucid built
                    8,428 cars and delivered 6,001 of those.

                  <p>
                    Chinese company Betavolt has announced an atomic energy
                    battery for consumers with a touted 50-year lifespan. The
                    Betavolt BV100 will be the first product to launch using the
                    firm's new atomic battery technology, constructed using a
                    nickel -63 isotope and diamond semiconductor material.
                    Betavolt says that its nuclear battery will target
                    aerospace, AI devices, medical, MEMS systems, intelligent
                    sensors, small drones, and robots – and may eventually mean
                    manufacturers can sell smartphones that never need charging.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Buying an electronics product that can go mains-free for 50
                    years would be amazing. However, the BV100, which is in the
                    pilot stage ahead of mass production, doesn't offer a lot of
                    power. This 15 x 15 x 5mm battery delivers 100 microwatts at
                    3 volts. It is mentioned that multiple BV100 batteries can
                    be used together in series or parallel depending on device
                    requirements. Betavolt also asserts that it has plans to
                    launch a 1-watt version of its atomic battery in 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In its press release, Betavolt says its atomic battery
                    is very different from similarly described power cells
                    developed by the US and USSR in the 1960s. It says that the
                    old nuclear batteries were large, dangerous, hot, and
                    expensive products. [...] Meanwhile, the Betavolt BV100 is
                    claimed to be safe for consumers and won't leak radiation
                    even if subjected to gunshots or puncture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new, improved levels of safety stem from the choice of
                    materials. Betavolt's battery uses a nickel -63 isotope as
                    the energy source, which decays to a stable isotope of
                    copper. This, plus the diamond semiconductor material, helps
                    the BV100 operate stably in environments ranging from -60 to
                    120 degrees Celsius, according to the firm.

                It shows 13 SLS Block 2 Cargo launches from 2032 to 2038 and two
                crewed SLS Block 2 launches to build various spacecraft in
                Cislunar space. The spacecraft are then fueled by an unspecified

                    An LG washing machine owner and self-confessed fintech geek
                    has asked the Twitterverse why his smart home appliance ate
                    an average of 3.66GB of data daily. Concerned about the

                    [...] For now, it looks like the favored answer to the data
                    mystery is to blame Asus for misreporting it. We may never
                    know what happened with Johnie, who is now running his LG
                    washing machine offline. LG did not immediately reply to a
                    request by Tom's Hardware for more information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another relatively innocent reason for the supposed high
                    volume of uploads could be an error in the Asus router
                    firmware. In a
                    <a
                      href="https://twitter.com/Johnie/status/1745194782463508672"

                    >
                    a day after his initial Tweet, Johnie noted "inaccuracy in
                    the ASUS router tool," with regard to Apple iMessage data
                    use. Other LG smart washing machine users showed device data
                    use from their router UIs. It turns out that these
                    appliances more typically use less than 1MB per day.

                    Though Johnie's Tweets were relatively light-hearted,
                    hacking smart connected devices can be severe. Consider what
                    could happen if medical or industrial IoT devices get taken
                    over by attackers, for example. A case in point is provided
                    by a story from earlier this week when Bosch
                    network-connected wrenches used in factories all around the

                    Like SO-DIMMs, CAMM modules are replaceable, though the
                    SO-DIMM slot's simple retention clips are exchanged for a
                    series of screws. But like soldered chips, they support
                    high-speed low-power LPDDR memory, they lie nearly flat
                    against your laptop's mainboard, and you don't need to
                    bother installing them in matched pairs to get dual-channel
                    memory speeds, since a single CAMM module can support both
                    single- and dual-channel speeds (with "future multi-channel
                    setups" also possible, according to JEDEC).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first hurdle for CAMM will be the same one any new
                    standard faces: getting the buy-in necessary to displace
                    already-prevalent standards. Crucial demoing a new LCAMM2
                    module is a solid step forward in that department, and
                    Samsung's commitment to introducing CAMM memory sometime
                    this year is another one. The standard already obviously has
                    buy-in from Dell, which
                    <a

                      >previous reporting from PCWorld</a
                    >
                    suggests that it has wide industry support as an eventual
                    replacement for SO-DIMM modules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The real question might not be whether CAMM replaces SO-DIMM
                    slots in the relatively small number of laptops that still
                    feature upgradable memory, but whether it can take us back
                    to a time when you could <em>assume</em> laptop memory would
                    be upgradable instead of having to search for a laptop that
                    supported it. As a PC manufacturer, why support CAMM in your
                    laptops when you could continue soldering RAM down, locking
                    buyers into paying whatever price you set for upgrades? The
                    prevalence of fast, standardized M.2 SSDs hasn't kept Apple
                    from sticking with its own proprietary storage in Macs, for
                    example.

                    The next release of OpenSSH (due around 2024/03) will make
                    DSA optional at compile time, but still enable it by
                    default. Users and downstream distributors of OpenSSH may
                    use this option to explore the impact of DSA removal in
                    their environments, or to hard-deprecate it early if they
                    desire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Around 2024/06, a release of OpenSSH will change this
                    compile-time default to disable DSA. It may still be enabled
                    by users/distributors if needed.

                  <p>
                    Finally, in the first OpenSSH release after 2025/01/01 the
                    DSA code will be removed entirely.
                  </p>

                Very few will notice this change. However, for those few to whom

                      Hummingbirds use two distinct sensory strategies to
                      control their flight, depending on whether they're
                      hovering or in forward motion, according to new research
                      by University of British Columbia (UBC) zoologists.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      "When in forward fight, hummingbirds rely on what we call
                      an 'internal forward model'—almost an ingrained, intuitive
                      autopilot—to gauge speed," says Dr. Vikram B. Baliga, lead
                      author of a new study on hummingbird locomotion published
                      in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. "There's just too
                      much information coming in to rely directly on every
                      visual cue from your surroundings."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      "But when hovering or dealing with cues that might require
                      a change in altitude, we found they rely much more on
                      real-time, direct visual feedback from their environment."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The findings not only provide insights into how the tiny,
                      agile birds perceive the world during transitions in
                      flight, but could inform the programming of onboard
                      navigation for next-generation autonomous flying and
                      hovering vehicles.

                    A newly discovered object is stretching our understanding of
                    what constitutes a galaxy.

                    Called J0613+52, this massive blob of something some 270
                    million light-years away appears to have no stars
                    whatsoever. At least, none that can be seen. It's just a
                    haze made of the kind of gas that's found between stars in
                    normal galaxies, drifting around by its lone self like an
                    absolute badass.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Its mass and motion appear to be normal for what we'd expect
                    of a spiral galaxy... in fact, if you extracted the stars
                    from a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way or Andromeda,
                    J0613+52 is pretty much what you'd end up with.

                    According to a team of astronomers led by astrophysicist
                    Karen O'Neil of the Green Bank Observatory, it could be the
                    first discovery of a primordial galaxy in the nearby
                    Universe – a galaxy made up mostly of the gas that formed at
                    the beginning of time.

                    [...] The launch of Peregrine kicked off NASA's Commercial
                    Lunar Payloads Services (CLPS) program, which aims to
                    accelerate lunar science through contracting private landers
                    to take payloads to the moon's surface. Since many of these
                    private spacecraft and landers are new and untested, NASA
                    leadership has accepted the risks involved in these

                    Whirligig beetles, the world's fastest-swimming insect,
                    achieve surprising speeds by employing a strategy shared by
                    speedy marine mammals and waterfowl, according to a new
                    Cornell University study that rewrites previous explanations
                    of the physics involved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The centimeter-long beetles can reach a peak acceleration of
                    100 meters per second and a top velocity of 100 body lengths
                    per second (or one meter per second).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not only do the results explain the whirligig's Olympian
                    speeds, but they also offer valuable insights for
                    bio-inspired designers of near-surface water robots and
                    uncrewed boats.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Until now, researchers have believed that whirligigs attain
                    their impressive speeds using a propulsion system called
                    drag-based thrust. This type of thrust requires the insect's
                    legs to move faster than the swimming speed, in order for
                    the legs to generate any thrust. For the whirligig beetle to
                    achieve such fast swimming speeds, its legs would need to
                    push against the water at unrealistic speeds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It could have well been questioned," said Chris Roh,
                    assistant biological and environmental engineering
                    professor. "The fastest swimmer and drag-based thrust don't
                    usually go together in the same sentence."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In fact, fast-swimming marine mammals and waterfowls tend to
                    forgo drag-based thrust in favor of lift-based thrust,
                    another propulsion system. The finding was described in a
                    study published Jan. 8 in the journal Current Biology.<br />...<br />Using
                    two high-speed cameras synchronized at different angles, the
                    researchers could film a whirligig and observe a lift-based
                    thrust mechanism at play. Lift-based thrust works like a
                    propeller, where the thrusting motion is perpendicular to
                    the water surface, eliminating drag and allowing for more
                    efficient momentum capable of greater speed.

                    people with Alzheimer's by 32%.

                    of aducanumab, a lab-made antibody that is delivered via IV.
                    This drug, first approved in 2021,  helps clear away
                    beta-amyloid, a protein fragment that clumps up in the
                    brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. (<a

                      >The drug's approval was controversial</a
                    >, and it's still not clear whether it actually slows
                    progression of the disease.)  After the infusion, the
                    researchers treated specific regions of the patients' brains
                    with focused ultrasound, but just on one side. That allowed
                    them to use the other half of the brain as a control. PET
                    scans revealed a greater reduction in amyloid plaques in the
                    ultrasound-treated regions than in those same regions on the
                    untreated side of the brain, suggesting that more of the
                    antibody was getting into the brain on the treated side.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Aducanumab does clear plaques without ultrasound, but it
                    takes a long time, perhaps in part because the antibody has
                    trouble entering the brain. "Instead of using the therapy
                    intravenously for 18 to 24 months to see the plaque
                    reduction, we want to see if we can achieve that reduction
                    in a few months," says Ali Rezai, a neurosurgeon at West
                    Virginia University Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute and
                    an author of the new study. Cutting the amount of time
                    needed to clear these plaques might help slow the memory
                    loss and cognitive problems that define the disease.

                    The device used to target and deliver the ultrasound waves,
                    developed by a company called
                    <a href="https://insightec.com/">Insightec</a>, consists of
                    an MRI machine and a helmet studded with ultrasound
                    transducers. It's FDA approved, but for an entirely
                    different purpose: to help stop tremors in people with
                    Parkinson's by creating lesions in the brain. To open the
                    blood-brain barrier, "we inject individuals intravenously
                    with microbubbles," Rezai says. These tiny gas bubbles,
                    commonly used as a contrast agent, travel through the
                    bloodstream. Using the MRI, the researchers can aim the
                    ultrasound waves at very specific parts of the brain "with
                    millimeter precision," Rezai says. When the waves hit the
                    microbubbles, the bubbles begin to expand and contract,
                    physically pushing apart the tightly packed cells that line
                    the brain's capillaries. "This temporary opening can last up
                    to 48 hours, which means that during those 48 hours, you can
                    have increased penetration into the brain of therapeutics,"
                    he says.

                    cybersecurity practices that we really do believe bring a
                    meaningful impact." And federal funding will hinge on

                  <p>
                    South Africa filed the lawsuit end of December, accusing
                    Israel of genocide in its war on Gaza and seeking a halt to
                    the brutal military assault that has killed more than 23,000

                    Both Israel and South Africa are signatories to the United
                    Nations Genocide Convention, which gives the ICJ – the
                    highest UN legal body – jurisdiction to rule on disputes
                    over the treaty.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All states that signed the convention are obliged to not
                    commit genocide and also to prevent and punish it. The
                    treaty defines genocide as "acts committed with intent to
                    destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial
                    or religious group".

                    [...] The ICC and the ICJ are sometimes conflated with one
                    another. Both the courts are located in The Hague,
                    Netherlands. While the purpose of the ICJ is to resolve
                    conflicts between states, the ICC prosecutes individuals for
                    committing crimes, according to the University of
                    Melbourne's Pursuit platform. While states cannot be sued at
                    the ICC, the prosecutor can open an investigation where
                    crimes, including genocide, were likely committed.

                    Israeli President Isaac Herzog told US Secretary of State
                    Antony Blinken on Tuesday that "there is nothing more
                    atrocious and preposterous" than the lawsuit. Herzog also
                    thanked Blinken for Washington's support of Israel.

                    Researchers have created the world's largest ancient human
                    gene bank by analyzing the bones and teeth of almost 5,000
                    humans who lived across western Europe and Asia up to 34,000
                    years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By sequencing ancient human DNA and comparing it to
                    modern-day samples, the international team of experts mapped
                    the historical spread of genes—and diseases—over time as
                    populations migrated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 'astounding' results have been revealed in four
                    trailblazing research papers published (10 January 2024) in
                    the same issue of Nature and provide new biological
                    understanding of debilitating disorders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The extraordinary study involved a large international team
                    led by Professor Eske Willerslev at the Universities of
                    Cambridge and Copenhagen, Professor Thomas Werge at the
                    University of Copenhagen, and Professor Rasmus Nielsen at
                    University of California, Berkeley and involved
                    contributions from 175 researchers from around the globe.
                  </p>
                  <p>The scientists found:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The startling origins of neurodegenerative diseases
                      including multiple sclerosis
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Why northern Europeans today are taller than people from
                      southern Europe
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      How major migration around 5,000 years ago introduced risk
                      genes into the population in north-western Europe—leaving
                      a legacy of higher rates of MS today
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Carrying the MS gene was an advantage at the time as it
                      protected ancient farmers from catching infectious
                      diseases from their sheep and cattle
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Genes known to increase the risk of diseases such as
                      Alzheimer's and type 2 diabetes were traced back to hunter
                      gatherers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Future analysis is hoped to reveal more about the genetic
                      markers of autism, ADHD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
                      and depression
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Northern Europe has the highest prevalence of MS in the
                    world. A new study has found the genes that significantly
                    increase a person's risk of developing MS were introduced
                    into north-western Europe around 5,000 years ago by sheep
                    and cattle herders migrating from the east.

                    The final hurdle to retrieving the full sample of asteroid
                    Bennu collected by OSIRIS-REx – the first asteroid return
                    sample in US history – has at last been overcome. NASA
                    technicians have been able to successfully remove the two
                    fasteners from the sampler head that have been preventing
                    them from opening the canister fully since September. This
                    canister opening has to be conducted under the most pristine
                    conditions to not contaminate the sample, so this was quite
                    the issue. Now, NASA can get to the pristine material from
                    asteroid Bennu.

                    The PC industry has ended a two-year run of declining
                    shipments, by growing 0.3 percent in Q4 of 2023, amid a
                    warning that the cost of components will rise this year, as
                    will the cost of laptops and desktops.

                    This is according to analyst Gartner's figures, but other
                    analysts have a different view of proceedings: IDC reckons
                    this was the eighth straight quarter of "sales-out"
                    shrinkage - meaning sales to retailers and distributors -
                    and Canalys estimates the market actually grew three
                    percent.

                    significant adjustment," said Mikako Kitagawa, director

                    of the pandemic, when the total available market swelled to

                    For centuries, a prevailing theory in philosophy has
                    asserted that at birth the human mind is a blank slate. More
                    recently, the same notion has also held sway in the field of
                    neurobiology, where it is commonly held that neural
                    connections are slowly created from scratch with the
                    accumulation of sensory information and experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eventually, the theory goes, this allows us to create
                    memories in space and time and to then learn from those
                    experiences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But after spending more than a decade studying activity in
                    the hippocampus, the area of brain which forms memory,
                    Yale's George Dragoi began to have his doubts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In his research on the hippocampus of rodents, Dragoi, an
                    associate professor of psychiatry and of neuroscience, has
                    found that early in life there emerge in this part of the
                    brain individual functional clusters of cells (and, soon
                    after, short sequences of cells) that predictably will be
                    activated by new experiences. Within days of birth, he
                    found, these cells, clusters, and short sequences become the
                    foundation for increasingly complex sequences of cell
                    assemblies that allow for the creation of memories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new article
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-023-00763-0"
                      >published</a
                    >
                    in the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Dragoi makes the
                    case that the human brain also develops a cellular template
                    soon after birth which defines who we are and how we
                    perceive the world. He describes it as "the generative
                    grammar" of the brain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Neurons organize like letters, then words, then sentences
                    and paragraphs which allow for the internalization of the
                    outside world," Dragoi said. "The brain has its own built-in
                    sense of grammar."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea, he admits, runs counter to the tenets of
                    empiricism, a centuries-old theory that all knowledge is
                    derived from sensory experience. It also contradicts widely
                    held assumption by life scientists that environmental
                    stimuli will entirely dictate how the brain processes and
                    stores information.

                    Logo text More than a decade ago, the normalization of tech
                    companies carrying content created by news organizations
                    without directly paying them — cannibalizing readership and
                    ad revenue — precipitated the decline of the media industry.
                    With the rise of generative artificial intelligence, those
                    same firms threaten to further tilt the balance of power
                    between Big Tech and news.

                  <p>
                    On Wednesday, lawmakers in the Senate Judiciary Committee
                    referenced their failure to adopt legislation that would've
                    barred the exploitation of content by Big Tech in backing
                    proposals that would require AI companies to strike
                    licensing deals with news organizations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and chair of the
                    committee, joined several other senators in supporting calls
                    for a licensing regime and to establish a framework
                    clarifying that intellectual property laws don't protect AI
                    companies using copyrighted material to build their
                    chatbots.

                    [...] The fight over the legality of AI firms eating content
                    from news organizations without consent or compensation is
                    split into two camps: Those who believe the practice is
                    protected under the "fair use" doctrine in intellectual
                    property law that allows creators to build upon copyrighted
                    works, and those who argue that it constitutes copyright
                    infringement. Courts are currently wrestling with the issue,
                    but an answer to the question is likely years away. In the
                    meantime, AI companies continue to use copyrighted content
                    as training materials, endangering the financial viability
                    of media in a landscape in which readers can bypass direct
                    sources in favor of search results generated by AI tools.

                    licensing its content. Before suing, it said that it had
                    been talking for months with OpenAI and Microsoft about a
                    deal, though the talks reached no such truce. In the
                    backdrop of AI companies crawling the internet for
                    high-quality written content, news organizations have been
                    backed into a corner, having to decide whether to accept
                    lowball offers to license their content or expend the time
                    and money to sue in a lawsuit. Some companies, like Axel

                The OpenWRT project is turning 20 years old this year. During
                that time they have adapted to existing hardware products. Now

                    It is not [a] new [idea]. We first spoke about this during
                    the OpenWrt Summits in 2017 and also 2018. It became clear
                    start of December 2023 while tinkering with Banana Pi style
                    devices that they are already pretty close to what we wanted
                    to achieve in '17/'18. Banana PIs have grown in popularity
                    within the community. They boot using a self compiled
                    Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A)and upstream U-Boot (thx
                    MTK/Daniel) and some of the boards are already fully
                    supported by the upstream Linux kernel. The only nonopen
                    sourcecomponents are the 2.5 GbE PHYandWi-Fi firmware
                    blobsrunning on separate cores that areindependent of the
                    main SoC running Linuxand the DRAM calibration routines
                    which are executed early during boot.

                    I contacted three project members (pepe2k, dangole, nbd) on
                    December 6th to outline the overall idea. We went over
                    several design proposals, At the beginning we focused on the
                    most powerful (and expensive) configurations possible but
                    finally ended up with something rather simple and above
                    all,feasible. We would like to propose the following as our
                    "first" community driven HW platform called "OpenWrt
                    One/AP-24.XY".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Together with pepe2k (thx a lot) I discussed this for many
                    hours and we worked out the following project proposal.
                    Instead of going insane with specifications, we decided to
                    include some nice features we believe all OpenWrt supported
                    platforms should have (e.g. being almost unbrickablewith
                    multiple recovery options, hassle-free system console
                    access, on-board RTC with battery backup etc.).
                  </p>
                  <p>This is our first design, so let's KiSS!</p>

                The preliminary hardware specifications are included in the
                message and it will contain a pair of flash chips for redundancy
                with the aim to make the router harder to accidentally brick
                during an update.

                    The belief that all fingerprints are unique is so well
                    accepted that crime novels and TV shows riff on it. Recent
                    AI research has challenged this notion, at least regarding
                    the fingerprints on different fingers of the same person.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Undergrad researchers at Columbia Engineering
                    <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1030475"

                    that while the branching and endpoints in the fingerprint
                    ridges might vary, the angles and curvature at the center of
                    the fingerprint could be the same across an individual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To determine this, the students used a deep contrastive
                    network and a US government database of 60,000 fingerprints
                    to study commonalities in fingerprints. They fed pairs of
                    prints to a neural network, with some coming from the same
                    person and others from different individuals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The network eventually became able to identify if prints
                    were from the same person to an accuracy of 77 percent. That
                    accuracy increased when multiple pairs of prints were
                    presented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team initially had no idea how the network was able to
                    identify whether the prints belonged to the same person. To
                    the human eye, the fingerprints certainly did not appear
                    similar.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In order to understand that it was merely identifying the
                    angles and starting points of the ridges, they had to study
                    the AI system's decision process. Thus, the team concluded
                    that the AI was using an unexpected forensic marker.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As it turns out, humans can be so set in their processes not
                    only when it comes to identifying prints but also
                    identifying science. The first journal the team submitted
                    their results to rejected them with the conclusion: "It is
                    well known that every fingerprint is unique," according to

                Windows isn't even telling users the correct error. Microsoft
                claims the update is failing on systems where the recovery
                partition isn't large enough. From my own experience, I have
                systems where I allowed the Windows installer to partition the
                drive automatically, meaning that Windows determined the size of
                the recovery partition. Windows 10 chose a size of 509 MB on my
                systems, and this doesn't seem to be scaled depending on the
                size of the user's drive. For most users, this is probably set
                automatically by the installer or the computer manufacturer.
                That said, I've read a user comment that the update

                >, so I'm not certain that this can really be blamed on
                insufficient disk space.

                Microsoft's advice to users is that they need to

                  >manually resize the recovery partition</a
                >. The commands are not intuitive, and there's absolutely no
                reason that Microsoft should be expecting ordinary users to be
                doing this. Resizing partitions is a fairly high risk operation,
                one that carries a risk of data loss if not done properly.
              </p>
              <p>
                This vulnerability probably just isn't a risk at all for most
                users, but that's not necessarily obvious. They just see the
                message that a security update failed with a cryptic error
                message. It's Microsoft's responsibility to ensure that security
                updates just work when they're being installed on a system in a
                reasonably standard configuration. If the Windows installer
                chose a recovery partition of 509 MB, then Microsoft needs to
                make their updates work with a recovery partition of that size,
                or they need to automatically resize the partition. This is a
                dumpster fire, and it's inexcusable to expect Microsoft to
                expect users to manually repartition their drives.

                    completed a successful field trial of a material they have
                    developed to help to protect crops from fungi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Simon Avery, professor of eukaryotic microbiology in the
                    Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, said, "The test
                    material is not toxic but works by passively resisting
                    attachment of fungal spores to protect surfaces from fungal
                    infection, including crop surfaces. Results from this first
                    field trial with wheat are particularly encouraging as there
                    is a lot of scope to optimize further the material
                    properties for crop protection."

                    bio-performance testing using in vitro microplates and
                    leaf-based assays. These were then taken forward into a
                    program to optimize and scale up their synthesis and
                    compound them into a spray formulation that could be used on
                    crops. Our findings showed that the material not only
                    significantly reduced fungal infection by the fungus
                    Septoria tritici by up to 26% but also that the crop grew
                    just as well as the control group—providing an alternative
                    that appears safer for the environment, wildlife, and
                    people, and is effective, too."

                  <p>
                    Sprayed directly onto wheat at timings conventional for
                    fungicides, the trial has provided the first real-world
                    scale exemplification of how the material interacts with
                    crops. The small plot trial compared the two polymer
                    candidates to a multisite fungicide and two commercial
                    fungicide programs.

                    [...] Valentina said, "Our attention is now turning to a
                    second field trial that's in the diary for this year to
                    further hone and improve the polymer so we can continue
                    turning our research into reality. The beauty of a material
                    like this is its lack of toxicity, the relative simplicity
                    of its production and the fact that it can be scaled up
                    easily—making it an incredibly attractive prospect for
                    several other industries, not just agriculture."

                    rates, nickel-and-dime users, implement arbitrary
                    restrictions, and force users toward hunting and pecking
                    their way through a confusing platter of exclusives and
                    availability windows risked driving befuddled users back to

                    NASA leadership is expected on Tuesday to announce a
                    "months-long delay" to the first crewed mission of the
                    agency's flagship Artemis program, according to one current
                    and one former NASA employee.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The delay affects NASA's Artemis II mission, which aims to
                    send four astronauts on a journey to fly by the moon and was
                    slated to lift off this November.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the mission is no longer expected to take place before
                    2025, according to the sources, confirming months of
                    speculation that a delay was imminent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA's Inspector General hinted at potential delays for the
                    mission in a November report, citing three main challenges
                    the space agency must address before it can safely fly
                    humans to the moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, the ground structure used to build, transport and
                    launch the program's massive Space Launch System rocket —
                    dubbed Mobile Launcher 1 — "sustained more damage than
                    expected."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The November report stated that repairs to the structure
                    were ongoing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, the heat shield on the Orion spacecraft — intended
                    to be the astronauts' home on Artemis II — "eroded in an
                    unexpected way" during Artemis I as it was exposed to
                    temperatures about half as hot as the surface of the sun
                    upon reentry into Earth's atmosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, the Inspector General noted what NASA officials
                    believed to be "the primary critical path" for the Artemis
                    II mission: preparing Orion for its first crew and
                    integrating it with the European Service Module, which
                    provides power and propulsion. The "critical path" in
                    project planning refers to the aspect of the mission that's
                    expected to take the longest.

                    on three unrelated people with recurrent infections and a
                    significant lack of T cells, specialized white blood cells
                    crucial to the immune system, had the same mutation that
                    hyperactivates Rac2. The study also observed that many of
                    the patient's neutrophils, cells that capture and ingest
                    invading microorganisms, were enlarged, indicating they were
                    consuming a lot of cellular material.

                    After reading this study, Denise Montell, who was involved
                    in the 1996 research and is the corresponding author in the
                    current study, wondered whether the T cells' disappearance
                    was due to innate immune cells with active Rac2 eating them,
                    as had happened with the fruit flies. So, Montell and the
                    other researchers turned their focus to macrophages, the
                    voracious counterpart of the neutrophil. The researchers
                    cultured human macrophages with and without hyperactive
                    Rac2, together with T cells, and found that macrophages with
                    hyperactive Rac consumed more cells, confirming their
                    hypothesis.

                    'Phoenix' lineup of APUs for its desktop AM5 PCs here at CES
                    2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada, bringing 1080p-capable integrated
                    graphics to the company's newest platform for the first
                    time, not to mention unlocking a new lower entry pricing
                    point to the AM5 ecosystem. The two flagship Ryzen 8000G
                    processors are also the world's first desktop CPUs with an
                    integrated high-performance Neural Processing Unit (NPU)
                    engine to boost performance in AI workloads, beating Intel
                    to the punch again — AMD was also the first x86 chipmaker to
                    bring an NPU to laptops. Now, they've come to the desktop

                    AMD's new Ryzen AI Software suite is designed to allow both
                    enthusiasts and developers to deploy pre-trained AI models
                    on its silicon with a one-click approach that greatly
                    simplifies the process. Users can select machine learning
                    models trained on frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow and
                    use AMD's Vitis AI quantizer to quantize the model into an
                    ONNX format. The software then partitions and compiles the
                    model, which runs on the Ryzen NPU. The Ryzen AI Software is
                    available now for free, and AMD also has a pre-optimized
                    model zoo on Hugging Face available.

                    [...] "We found that adults with hearing loss who regularly
                    used hearing aids had a 24% lower risk of mortality than
                    those who never wore them," said Janet Choi, MD, MPH, the
                    study's lead researcher. "These results are exciting because
                    they suggest that hearing aids may play a protective role in
                    people's health and prevent early death."

                    U.S. honey yields have been in decline since the 1990s, and
                    researchers have been trying to understand why. Is it
                    pesticide use? The decline in floral biodiversity?

                    They found reduced honey yield correlated with herbicide
                    application and land use policies that don't include
                    pollinator support. Among their findings, states with both
                    warm and cool regions had higher honey yields, and local
                    soil productivity was surprisingly useful in estimating
                    honey yield.

                    Canada issued a warning Monday that it stands ready to

                    plans—and also said the plans wouldn't work for the US,
                    anyway. "Bulk importation will not provide an effective
                    solution to the problem of high drug prices in the US,"

                      >celebrated it</a
                    >, claiming the drug imports will save the state "up to $180
                    million in the first year alone." There are caveats, though.
                    Before Florida can import any drugs, it must complete
                    several obligations, including submitting to the FDA
                    additional drug-specific information, testing the drugs for
                    authenticity and FDA compliance, and relabeling them in
                    accordance with FDA labeling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The FDA authorized the importation program in accordance
                    with section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
                    (FD&amp;C Act). The move stems from President Biden's
                    "Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American
                    Economy," which directed the FDA to help develop such
                    programs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Proponents of the program in the US say that importing
                    cheaper drugs from abroad could help lower US drug prices by
                    offering more competition on the market. Canada, like other
                    countries, has lower drug prices than the US, partly because
                    the country's national health system negotiates prices for
                    prescription drugs.

                    But Canada, which has a population around nine times smaller
                    than the US, has been staunchly opposed to the US importing
                    its drugs. It has repeatedly said that diverting medicines
                    to the US could lead to drug shortages in Canada, make
                    existing shortages worse, and/or cause price spikes.

                    [...] Drug makers in the US also intend to fight the plans.

                    claimed importation "poses a serious danger to public

                    The sharks' huge jaws were lined with 276 teeth, and they
                    likely lost and replaced thousands over their lifetimes,
                    allowing plenty of teeth the chance to fossilize.

                    the University Museum Bergen in Norway and co-author of the
                    study, said in a statement. The study was recently published

                    providing evidence that this megalodon fossil, lodged in

                    The term <em>enshittification </em>became popular in 2023
                    after it was used in a blog post by author Cory Doctorow,
                    who used it to describe how digital platforms can become
                    worse and worse. "Here is how platforms die: first, they are
                    good to their users; then they abuse their users to make
                    things better for their business customers; finally, they
                    abuse those business customers to claw back all the value
                    for themselves. Then, they die. I call this
                    enshittification," Doctorow wrote on his Pluralistic blog.

                    Presiding at the Jan. 6 voting session were Ben Zimmer,
                    chair of the ADS New Words Committee and language columnist
                    for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and Dr. Kelly
                    Elizabeth Wright of Virginia Tech, data czar of the New
                    Words Committee. "<em>Enshittification</em> is a sadly apt
                    term for how our online lives have become gradually
                    degraded," Zimmer said. "From the time that it first
                    appeared in Doctorow's posts and articles, the word had all
                    the markings of a successful neologism, being instantly
                    memorable and adaptable to a variety of contexts."

                    If you're using a work laptop or phone, it's also worth
                    keeping in mind that your employer can likely see many, if
                    not all, of the things you do on those devices. If you're
                    searching for a new job or running personal tasks, you
                    likely want to do them on personal devices.

                    [...] As much as anything, being more anonymous online is
                    linked to your mentality. Simply put, the less you share
                    about yourself online, the less identifiable you will be.
                    That means being careful about what you post on social
                    media—not sharing information that could identify you, your
                    location, or others around you.

                  <p>
                    [...] As well as being cautious about what you post online,
                    there's also the option to use one-time accounts or masked
                    identities for certain parts of your life. If you require a
                    messaging account that's not tied to your current phone

                    It has also become easier in recent years to hide your email
                    address from websites and services that you are signing up

                    Being totally anonymous online is incredibly hard to do—and
                    the level of anonymity you require will depend on why you're
                    trying not to be identified. Beyond what we've outlined here
                    (and how paranoid you are), there are more advanced steps
                    that you can take.

                  <p>
                    It may be worth considering an operating system for your
                    phone or computer that is focused on privacy and anonymity.
                    The <a href="https://tails.net/">Tails operating system</a>,
                    which you need install and run from a USB stick each time
                    you use it, includes Tor, OnionShare, and multiple other
                    tools you can use on your computer. For Android devices,
                    <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a> is an open
                    source operating system that strips away the Google-linked
                    Android elements and focuses on privacy.

                    There are also a number of extreme security measures you can

                    without going all the way into what is needed for being
