                Now that the poles are melting, and that seven of the world's
                ten biggest shipping companies have suspended transit through
                the Red Sea, and that deforestation is drying up the Panama
                Canal, the site <i>Modern Diplomacy</i> raises the question,

                  href="https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/01/27/how-viable-is-arctic-shipping/"

                >? Even with the ice eventually out of the way, it is not
                necessarily the best option for transportation.

                    Increasingly, yes — and for a worrying reason. The Arctic is
                    warming four times faster than the global average. Since
                    1978 ice cover has shrunk by roughly 78,000 square
                    kilometres per year. In June 2023 a study in Nature
                    Communications, a journal, suggested that the Arctic's first
                    ice-free summer could come as soon as the 2040s, even if the
                    world significantly reduces its greenhouse-gas emissions. As
                    ice thins and cold-water shipping technology advances,
                    Arctic waters will become more easily navigable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They are already getting busier, if from a low base. The
                    most popular shipping route in the Arctic is the nsr, which
                    is controlled by Russia. Trade volumes along the route
                    increased by 755% between 2014 and 2022. Russia wants
                    traffic to increase ten-fold from 2022 levels by 2035. In
                    October it announced a joint venture with DP World, an
                    Emirati logistics company, to develop Arctic container
                    shipping. That month NewNew Shipping Line, a Chinese firm,
                    completed its first round-trip on an Arctic route between
                    Shanghai and St Petersburg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Arctic will struggle to rival established shipping
                    routes. Extreme seasonal weather limits its potential for
                    commercial shipping. But as the ice cover shrinks, its
                    waters will become busier — and Russia will make ever
                    greater use of them.

                    A nearly invisible dwarf galaxy is challenging the model of
                    dark matter. An international team of astronomers, led by
                    the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) in
                    collaboration with the University of La Laguna (ULL) and

                    Nube, which means "Cloud" in Spanish, was named by the
                    5-year-old daughter of one of the researchers, aptly
                    reflecting the galaxy's ghostly and diffuse appearance. Its
                    discovery is significant because its faint surface
                    brightness allowed it to remain undetected in previous sky
                    surveys, despite its considerable size.

                    Nube is unique in its properties, being ten times fainter
                    yet ten times more extended than other

                    with a similar number of stars. Its discovery is akin to
                    finding a hidden treasure in a well-explored attic. Nube is
                    large and yet faint, a ghostly apparition in the universe.
                    To put it into perspective, it's about one-third the size of

                    What sets it apart is its significant amount of dark matter,
                    an invisible substance that does not emit, absorb, or
                    reflect light, making it undetectable by traditional

                    will sell off a third of its electric fleet, totaling
                    roughly 20,000 vehicles, and use the money they bring to
                    purchase more gasoline powered vehicles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Electric vehicles have been hurting Hertz's financials,
                    executives have said, because, despite costing less to
                    maintain, they have higher damage-repair costs and, also,
                    higher depreciation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "[C]ollision and damage repairs on an EV can often run about
                    twice that associated with a comparable combustion engine
                    vehicle," Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr said in a recent analyst
                    call.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And EV price declines in the new car market have pushed down
                    the resale value of Hertz's used EV rental cars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For rental car companies like Hertz, which sell lots
                    of vehicles in the used car market, depreciation has a big
                    impact on their business, and is a major factor when
                    deciding which cars to have in their fleets.

                    The FTC declined to comment on whether the order also
                    applies to data purchases by intelligence agencies. In
                    defining "location data," the FTC order seems to carve out
                    exceptions for any data collected outside the US and used
                    for either "security purposes" or "national security
                    purposes conducted by federal agencies or other federal
                    entities."

                    NSA officials told Wyden that not only is the intelligence
                    agency purchasing data on Americans located in the US but
                    that it also bought Americans' Internet metadata.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In response to Wyden's letter to Haines, the Under
                    Secretary of Defense for Intelligence &amp; Security, Ronald
                    Moultrie, said that the Department of Defense (DoD) "adheres
                    to high standards of privacy and civil liberties
                    protections" when buying Americans' location data. He also
                    said that he was "not aware of any requirement in US law or
                    judicial opinion" forcing the DoD to "obtain a court order
                    in order to acquire, access, or use" commercially available
                    information that "is equally available for purchase to
                    foreign adversaries, US companies, and private persons as it
                    is to the US government."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In another response to Wyden, NSA leader General Paul
                    Nakasone told Wyden that the "NSA takes steps to minimize
                    the collection of US person information" and "continues to
                    acquire only the most useful data relevant to mission
                    requirements." That includes some commercially available
                    information on Americans "where one side of the
                    communications is a US Internet Protocol address and the
                    other is located abroad," data which Nakasone said is
                    "critical to protecting the US Defense Industrial Base" that
                    sustains military weapons systems.

                    from 32.8% last year to 35.7% this year. Links from over a
                    decade ago have a fifty per cent chance of no longer
                    working. Thankfully, only three out of over 550 have gone
                    missing in the last few years of links, but only time will

                As pointed out in the early and mid 1990s, the inherent
                centralization of sites, later web sites, is the basis for this
                weakness. That is to say one single copy exists which resides
                under the control of the publisher / maintainer. When that one
                copy goes, it is gone.

                    Despite technical and non-technical countermeasures, humans
                    continue to be tricked by phishing emails. How users make
                    email response decisions is a missing piece in the puzzle to
                    identifying why people still fall for phishing emails. We
                    conducted an empirical study using a think-aloud method to
                    investigate how people make 'response decisions' while
                    reading emails. The grounded theory analysis of the in-depth
                    qualitative data has enabled us to identify different
                    elements of email users' decision-making that influence
                    their email response decisions. Furthermore, we developed a
                    theoretical model that explains how people could be driven
                    to respond to emails based on the identified elements of
                    users' email decision-making processes and the relationships
                    uncovered from the data. The findings provide deeper
                    insights into phishing email susceptibility due to people's
                    email response decision-making behavior. We also discuss the
                    implications of our findings for designers and researchers
                    working in anti-phishing training, education, and awareness
                    interventions.

              <p>The conclusion:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    In this paper, we investigate in-depth how people make email
                    response decisions while reading their emails. Analysis of
                    the collected qualitative data enabled us to develop a
                    theoretical model that describes how people can be driven to
                    respond to emails by clicking on email links and replying to
                    or downloading attachments based on people's email response
                    decision-making elements and their relationships. Based on
                    an improved understanding of how people make email
                    responses, this study enables us to identify how people can
                    be susceptible to manipulation, even in our controlled
                    experiment environment. We proposed five concrete
                    enhancements to state-of-the-art anti-phishing education,
                    training, and awareness tools to support users in making
                    safe email responses. Among others, we suggest that the goal
                    of anti-phishing education, training, and awareness tools
                    should shift from accurate email legitimacy judgments to
                    secure email responses. Therefore, we believe our work lays
                    the foundation for improving future anti- phishing
                    interventions to make a significant difference in how we
                    prevent phishing email attacks in the future.

                    A recent study published in Ecological Informatics by a team
                    of University of Alaska Fairbanks researchers has used
                    artificial intelligence to further illuminate a habitat swap
                    among short-billed gulls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Typically gulls live along coastlines and near water sources
                    such as rivers. They feed on bugs and other small mammals,
                    fish or birds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team found that from May to August, short-billed gulls
                    occupied areas that have typically been the haunts of
                    scavenging ravens. Those include supermarket and fast-food
                    restaurant parking lots and other human-made structures,
                    such as industrial gravel pads and garbage dumpsters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study is the first of its kind to compile a three-year
                    dataset using a citizen science-based, opportunistic
                    research method to include a large sample of gulls and other
                    sub-Arctic birds in urban Alaska. The study provides a
                    current snapshot of the habitat shift to an urban landscape.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    UAF professor Falk Huettmann, first author on the paper, and
                    his team used artificial intelligence modeling that was
                    given predictors—environmental variables for specific
                    locations—to extrapolate information about the gull
                    occurrences. A similar, earlier study analyzed the
                    distribution of the great gray owl.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this study, researchers used U.S. census data as well as
                    urban municipality data, such as distances to roads,
                    restaurants, waterways and waste transfer stations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Using socioeconomic datasets like the U.S. census is a real
                    game-changer," said Moriz Steiner, a graduate student in
                    Huettmann's lab. "It allows us to mirror the real-world
                    environment and simulate a situation as true to nature as
                    possible by including them as variables in the models."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings indicate that the gulls' transition from
                    natural habitats to a more urban landscape is spurred by the
                    availability of human food, as well as industrial changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "They are exploiting the waste opportunity left behind by
                    humans," said Huettmann, who is associated with UAF's
                    Institute of Arctic Biology.

                    With this letter, written by Gary Gygax to wargaming zine

                      >pointed out by the Grognardia blog</a
                    >), points to the last Sunday of January 1974 as the best
                    date for the "anniversary" of <em>D&amp;D</em>. The first
                    sale was in "late January 1974," Gygax later wrote, and on
                    the last Sunday of January 1974, Gygax invited potential
                    customers to drop by his house in the afternoon to try it
                    out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You could argue whether a final draft, printing,
                    announcement, sale, or first session counts as the true
                    "birth" of <em>D&amp;D</em>, but we have to go with
                    something, and Peterson's reasoning seems fairly sound.
                    Gygax's memory, and a documented session at his own house,
                    are a good point to pin down for when we celebrate this
                    thing that has shaped a seemingly infinite number of other
                    things.

                    As with playing a good campaign, you've got a lot of options
                    for how you acknowledge <em>D&amp;D</em>'s long presence and
                    deep influence. The game system itself, now under Wizards of
                    the Coast, will this year push "One D&amp;D," a name the
                    <em>D&amp;D</em> leaders sometimes stick with and sometimes
                    don't. Whatever the next wave is called, it includes new
                    handbooks, guides, and <em>Monster Manual</em> books that
                    are

                    >
                    but also an evolution. Books like
                    <em>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</em> and
                    <em>Tasha's Cauldron of Everything</em> will be codified and
                    unified by a new sourcebook at some point, but all of it
                    will be compatible with <em>5th Edition</em> material.

                    "It was a huge experimental challenge," says Böhmer. The
                    minuscule fluctuations in the molecules had to be documented
                    using an ultra-sensitive video camera. "You can't just watch
                    the molecules jiggle around," adds Blochowicz.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yet the researchers did notice something. They directed a
                    laser at the sample made of glass. The molecules within it
                    scatter the light. The scattered beams overlap and form a
                    chaotic pattern of light and dark spots on the camera's
                    sensor. Statistical methods can be used to calculate how the
                    fluctuations vary over time—in other words, how fast the
                    material's internal clock ticks. "This requires extremely
                    precise measurements which were only possible using
                    state-of-the-art video cameras," says Blochowicz.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it was worth it. The statistical analysis of the
                    molecular fluctuations, which researchers from Roskilde
                    University in Denmark helped with, revealed some surprising
                    results. In terms of material time, the fluctuations of the
                    molecules are time-reversible. This means that they do not
                    change if the material time is allowed to tick backwards,
                    similar to the video of the pendulum, which looks the same
                    when played forwards and backwards.

                    Of course, there is a reason for the separation of the
                    closing and locking functions, but not the opening and
                    unlocking functions: it avoids a Denial of Service attack
                    where someone can just press "close" and then jump out
                    before the door closes. If the interior "close" button
                    automatically locked the door, this would result in the
                    toilet becoming permanently inaccessible.

                  <p>
                    The problem with this design is that most people don't
                    understand state machines, and this design confused a lot of
                    people who were unable to lock the door correctly, or
                    believed they'd locked the door when they hadn't.

                The result is a denial of service, being able to lock the door
                from the inside while no one is actually inside to subsequently
                unlock the door again.

                    Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the bacteria used in the study, can
                    naturally consume polyethylene as a food source. The RPI
                    team tackled the challenge of engineering this bacteria to
                    convert the carbon atoms of polyethylene into a genetically
                    encoded silk protein. Surprisingly, they found that their
                    newly developed bacteria could make the silk protein at a
                    yield rivaling some bacteria strains that are more
                    conventionally used in biomanufacturing.

                    [...] "What's really exciting about this process is that
                    unlike the way plastics are produced today, our process is
                    low-energy and doesn't require the use of toxic chemicals,"
                    Zha said. "The best chemists in the world could not convert
                    polyethylene into spider silk, but these bacteria can. We're
                    really harnessing what nature has developed to do
                    manufacturing for us."

                    'Now I'm going to teach you how to slurp,' says Kathryn
                    Sinclair, senior brand ambassador at British tea firm
                    Twinings. 'We taste from the olfactory glands and we need to
                    open these up, so breathe in through the mouth, breathe out
                    through the mouth and slurp.' She noisily sucks up the
                    pale-coloured liquid using a soup spoon. I try the same,
                    experiencing a slightly sweet and fresh floral taste. This
                    is tea number one – white tea – in the Twinings tea master
                    class held at the company's 300-year old shop on the Strand
                    in London. Sinclair notes that white tea is a young leaf
                    that is rich in antioxidants and which has the highest
                    caffeine content out of all the tea types because it is the
                    least processed. 'White tea is the purest form of tea,' she
                    explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ultimately, however, the differences in tea types come
                    down to chemistry, and this chemistry is influenced by
                    cultivation, environment, weather and, importantly,
                    processing. 'From the chemistry perspective, tea is the
                    ultimate mystery and challenge to food and analytical
                    chemists,' says Nikolai Kuhnert, a chemist at Jacobs
                    University in Bremen, Germany. 'No food material is more
                    fascinating and chemically diverse and complex.'
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, more research is required into the specific
                    health properties of tea and its chemicals. There are
                    concerns around the health impact of caffeine and, as yet,
                    the US Food and Drug Administration has been slow to
                    recognise the benefits of tea, Melican says. 'Personally, I
                    drink nearly a quart of tea a day. I am 75 years old,
                    healthy, active and still work a 50-hour week – so there may
                    be something in it.'
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Drinking tea has been popular for millennia. Slowly the
                    science is starting to reveal the complex chemical nature of
                    our favourite brew. 'In the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy,
                    the Nutri Matic drink dispenser is unable to provide Arthur
                    Dent with a good cup of tea. Now the science can explain
                    why,' says Kuhnert: 'It's just too complicated.'

                    The hackers who recently broke into Microsoft's network and
                    monitored top executives' email for two months did so by
                    gaining access to an aging test account with administrative
                    privileges, a major gaffe on the company's part, a
                    researcher said.

                    The new detail was provided in vaguely worded language
                    included in a post Microsoft published on Thursday. It
                    expanded on a disclosure Microsoft

                    known as password spraying to exploit a weak credential for
                    logging into a "legacy non-production test tenant account"
                    that wasn't protected by multifactor authentication. From
                    there, they somehow acquired the ability to access email
                    accounts that belonged to senior executives and employees
                    working in security and legal teams. A "pretty big config

                    updating customers on findings from its ongoing
                    investigation, Microsoft provided more details on how the
                    hackers achieved this monumental escalation of access. The
                    hackers, part of a group Microsoft tracks as Midnight
                    Blizzard, gained persistent access to the privileged email
                    accounts by abusing the OAuth authorization protcol, which
                    is used industry-wide to allow an array of apps to access
                    resources on a network. After compromising the test tenant,
                    Midnight Blizzard used it to create a malicious app and
                    assign it rights to access every email address on
                    Microsoft's Office 365 email service.

                    Add a dash of creamer to your morning coffee, and clouds of
                    white liquid will swirl around your cup. But give it a few
                    seconds, and those swirls will disappear, leaving you with
                    an ordinary mug of brown liquid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Something similar happens in quantum computer chips --
                    devices that tap into the strange properties of the universe
                    at its smallest scales -- where information can quickly
                    jumble up, limiting the memory capabilities of these tools.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That doesn't have to be the case, said Rahul Nandkishore,
                    associate professor of physics at the University of Colorado
                    Boulder.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new coup for theoretical physics, he and his colleagues
                    have used math to show that scientists could create,
                    essentially, a scenario where the milk and coffee never mix
                    -- no matter how hard you stir them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The group's findings may lead to new advances in quantum
                    computer chips, potentially providing engineers with new
                    ways to store information in incredibly tiny objects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Think of the initial swirling patterns that appear when you
                    add cream to your morning coffee," said Nandkishore, senior
                    author of the new study. "Imagine if these patterns
                    continued to swirl and dance no matter how long you
                    watched."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers still need to run experiments in the lab to make
                    sure that these never-ending swirls really are possible. But
                    the group's results are a major step forward for physicists
                    seeking to create materials that remain out of balance, or
                    equilibrium, for long periods of time -- a pursuit known as
                    "ergodicity breaking."

                    is their longevity. The team found that just one dose at a
                    young age can have lifelong effects. That single treatment
                    can protect against conditions that commonly occur later in
                    life, like obesity and diabetes. Amor Vegas explains:

                    "T cells have the ability to develop memory and persist in
                    your body for really long periods, which is very different
                    from a chemical drug. With CAR T cells, you have the
                    potential of getting this one treatment, and then that's it.
                    For chronic pathologies, that's a huge advantage. Think
                    about patients who need treatment multiple times per day
                    versus you get an infusion, and then you're good to go for
                    multiple years."

                    CAR T cells have been used to treat a variety of blood
                    cancers, receiving FDA approval for this purpose in 2017.

                    Amor Vegas' lab is now investigating whether CAR T cells let
                    mice live not only healthier but also longer. If so, society
                    will be one mouse step closer to the coveted fountain of

                    Deepfakes use artificial intelligence (AI) to make a video
                    of someone by manipulating their face or body. A study in
                    2023 found that there has been a 550% rise in the creation
                    of doctored images since 2019, fuelled by the emergence of
                    AI.

                  <p>
                    US Representative Joe Morelle called the spread of the
                    pictures "appalling".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a statement, X said it was "actively removing" the images
                    and taking "appropriate actions" against the accounts
                    involved in spreading them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It added: "We're closely monitoring the situation to ensure
                    that any further violations are immediately addressed, and
                    the content is removed." While many of the images appear to
                    have been removed at the time of publication, one photo of
                    Swift was viewed a reported 47 million times before being
                    taken down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There are currently no federal laws against the
                    sharing or creation of deepfake images, though there have
                    been moves at state level to tackle the issue.

                    In the UK, the sharing of deepfake pornography became
                    illegal as part of its Online Safety Act in 2023.

                    Someday in the not too distant future, it might no longer be
                    possible to drive a brand-new car faster than 80 mph in
                    California. That's because state senator Scott Wiener
                    earlier this week proposed a new bill that aims to prevent
                    certain new vehicles from going more than 10 mph over the
                    speed limit. In California, the maximum posted speed limit
                    is 70 mph, meaning anything north of 80 mph would be off
                    limits.

                    The Speeding and Fatality Emergency Reduction on California
                    Streets—or SAFER California Streets, for short—is a package
                    of bills that includes SB 961 that was published Tuesday,
                    which essentially calls for speed governors on new cars and
                    trucks built or sold in California starting with the 2027
                    model year. These vehicles would be required to have an
                    "intelligent speed limiter system" that electronically
                    prevents the driver from speeding above the aforementioned
                    threshold.

                    A California lawmaker announced a bill Wednesday that would
                    require new passenger vehicles and large trucks sold in
                    California to be equipped with technology that would prevent
                    them from going more than 10 miles an hour above the speed
                    limit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If passed, Senate Bill 961 would require vehicles, beginning
                    with model year 2027, that are manufactured or sold in
                    California to come with a speed governor, also known as an
                    intelligent speed limiter. It would make California the
                    first state in the nation to mandate this technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These devices match a vehicle's global positioning system
                    (GPS) location with a database of speed limits to figure out
                    what speed a vehicle should be traveling at during any given
                    time. They also sometimes use onboard cameras to read speed
                    limit signs. With this information, the devices are then
                    able to prevent the driver from speeding more than 10 miles
                    an hour above the speed limit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Drivers would be able to temporarily override the speed
                    governor device, according to the proposal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The requirement for speed governors would not apply to
                    emergency vehicles.

                I for one can't wait for the hackers to change the database so
                freeway speed limits are 15 MPH.

                    As digital devices progressively replace pen and paper,
                    taking notes by hand is becoming increasingly uncommon in
                    schools and universities. Using a keyboard is recommended
                    because it's often faster than writing by hand. However, the
                    latter has been found to improve spelling accuracy and
                    memory recall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To find out if the process of forming letters by hand
                    resulted in greater brain connectivity, researchers in
                    Norway now investigated the underlying neural networks
                    involved in both modes of writing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We show that when writing by hand, brain connectivity
                    patterns are far more elaborate than when typewriting on a
                    keyboard," said Prof Audrey van der Meer, a brain researcher
                    at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and
                    co-author of the study published in
                    <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Such widespread brain connectivity is known to be crucial
                    for memory formation and for encoding new information and,
                    therefore, is beneficial for learning."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers collected EEG data from 36 university
                    students who were repeatedly prompted to either write or
                    type a word that appeared on a screen. When writing, they
                    used a digital pen to write in cursive directly on a
                    touchscreen. When typing they used a single finger to press
                    keys on a keyboard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    High-density EEGs, which measure electrical activity in the
                    brain using 256 small sensors sewn in a net and placed over
                    the head, were recorded for five seconds for every prompt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Connectivity of different brain regions increased when
                    participants wrote by hand, but not when they typed. "Our
                    findings suggest that visual and movement information
                    obtained through precisely controlled hand movements when
                    using a pen contribute extensively to the brain's
                    connectivity patterns that promote learning," van der Meer
                    said.

                    Chipmaker TSMC had a mixed final calendar quarter of 2023,
                    with profit falling less than expected and revenue growth
                    “essentially flat,” in another sign that the global
                    semiconductor downturn is over.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chief executive CC Wei said of the quarter: “Our business
                    has bottomed out on a year-over-year basis, and we expect
                    2024 to be a healthy growth year for TSMC, supported by
                    continued strong ramp of our industry-leading 3nm
                    technologies, strong demand for the 5nm technologies and
                    robust AI-related demand.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Looking at TSMC’s production of wafer shipments during
                    the quarter, 5nm was the largest single process node by
                    revenue, at 35 percent. 7nm accounted for another 17
                    percent, while the current most advanced 3nm nodes accounted
                    for 15 percent of revenue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The latter figure shows that 3nm uptake is indeed
                    increasing, as it made up just 6 percent of TSMC’s wafer
                    revenue in the previous quarter. Older nodes such as 16nm
                    still accounted for 8 percent, with 28nm at 7 percent, but
                    advanced nodes, which TSMC now defines as 7nm or better,
                    accounted for 67 percent of wafer revenue for this quarter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “2023 was a challenging year for the global
                    semiconductor industry, but our technology leadership
                    enabled TSMC to outperform the foundry industry,” Huang
                    commented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He also struck an optimistic note looking ahead, telling
                    investors that: “Despite a challenging 2023, our revenue
                    remains well on track to grow between 15 and 20 percent CAGR
                    over the next several years in US dollar terms, which is the
                    target we communicated back in the January 2022 investor
                    conference,” Huang commented.

                    Chief exec Wei added he expected the overall semiconductor

                    digital computer.

                  <p>
                    Its existence was kept largely secret until the early 2000s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The first Colossus began operating from Bletchley
                    Park, the home of the UK's codebreakers, in early 1944. By
                    the end of the war there were 10 computers helping to
                    decipher the Nazi messages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fitted with 2,500 valves and standing at more than 2 metres
                    tall, Colossus required a team of skilled operators and
                    technicians to run and maintain it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Blueprints of its inner workings have also been made
                    public for the first time, along with a letter referring to
                    "rather alarming German instructions" intercepted by
                    Colossus, as well as an audio clip of the machine at work.

                    different concerns about LLM security and sleeper agents. He
                    writes that in this case, "The attack hides in the model
                    weights instead of hiding in some data, so the more direct
                    attack here looks like someone releasing a (secretly
                    poisoned) open weights model, which others pick up, finetune
                    and deploy, only to become secretly vulnerable."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This means that an open source LLM could potentially become
                    a security liability (even beyond the usual vulnerabilities
                    like
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/twitter-pranksters-derail-gpt-3-bot-with-newly-discovered-prompt-injection-hack/"
                      >prompt injections</a
                    >). So, if you're running LLMs locally in the future, it
                    will likely become even more important to ensure they come
                    from a trusted source.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's worth noting that Anthropic's AI Assistant, Claude, is
                    not an open source product, so the company may have a vested
                    interest in promoting closed-source AI solutions. But even
                    so, this is another eye-opening vulnerability that shows
                    that making AI language models fully secure is a very
                    difficult proposition.

                    It's no secret that the ancient Romans were lovers of wine.
                    So gripped by the grape were they, that they even worshiped
                    a god—Bacchus—devoted to wine and merriment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, little is known about what their wine actually tasted
                    like. Was it bitter or sweet? Fruity or earthy? According to
                    a pioneering new study, it was rather spicy and smelled like
                    toast.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study, published on Jan. 23 in the journal Antiquity,
                    analyzed Roman clay jars, known as dolia, which were used to
                    manufacture, ferment and store ancient wines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By comparing these vessels, which have long been overlooked,
                    to similar containers used in modern wine-making,
                    researchers were able to demystify the ancient flavors and
                    the processes that created them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings "change much of our current understanding of
                    Roman winemaking," researchers, affiliated with multiple
                    European institutions, said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dolia vessels were porous, egg-shaped containers that would
                    have been partially buried underground and sealed during the
                    wine-making process—all factors that would have contributed
                    to the flavor palette of the finished product.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result of this process—and the addition of natural
                    yeasts—the wine would have taken on a "slightly spicy" taste
                    and given off the aroma of "toasted bread, apples, roasted
                    walnuts and curry," researchers said.

                    The knot is composed of 54 atoms, chained together and
                    ensnared in a trefoil, the simplest nontrivial knot. The
                    knot has no loose end; it is a continuous loop, passing
                    through itself in mesmerizing arcs. The team's work
                    describing the self-assembled "metallaknot" was published in
                    Nature Communications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is made up of gold, carbon, and phosphorus, as reported
                    by New Scientist. The knot is formulaically described as
                    [Au6{1,2-C6H4(OCH2CC)2}3{Ph2P(CH2)4PPh2}3], or Au6 for
                    short, in reference to the six gold atoms in the knot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You may wonder how a team determines the tightness of a knot
                    at the molecular scale. As the researchers state in their
                    paper, the knots are "classified according to the minimum
                    number of crossings when the reduced form of the structure
                    is projected onto a two-dimensional surface."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2017, a team of researchers crafted a knot with 24 atoms
                    per crossing, which made it into the Guinness Book. In 2020,
                    a different team managed to produce a 69-atom-long knot with
                    a backbone crossing ratio (or BCR) of 23, making it the
                    record holder. The smaller the BCR, the tighter the knot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The newest—and indeed, smallest and tightest knot—beats the
                    2020 record. The new knot is just 54 atoms long, and has a
                    remarkably low BCR of just 18. It is tighter than the BCR of
                    the tightest organic trefoil knots by a BCR margin of 7.3.

                    As part of its mandate in the Digital Services Act, the
                    European Commission has sent requests for a new set of
                    information about to 17 tech companies about how they
                    protect users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The European Commission is casting its net a bit wider on
                    this round of information requests. In addition to the
                    regulars it demands information from, in Apple, Google,
                    Microsoft, and Meta, it has also hit AliExpress, Zalando,
                    Pinterest, Snapchat, TikTok, and more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A report by Reuters on Thursday morning claims that data
                    requested includes data relevant to the EU elections, how
                    counterfeit goods are identified, plus information on how
                    the platforms tackle both illegal content and sale of
                    illicit goods. It's not clear why Apple is bundled up in
                    this round of requests, but it potentially involves how it
                    manages
                    <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/imessage"
                      >iMessage</a
                    >, or perhaps cloned apps on the

                      >App Store</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In total, the 17 companies under 10 different umbrellas must
                    provide requested information by February 9.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The information request follows one on
                    <a
                      href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/12/14/european-commission-grills-apple-and-google-on-app-store-risks-and-ad-practices"
                      >December 14, 2023</a
                    >. That request appeared to be a little more broad with some
                    overlap to the new request. That request reportedly covered
                    "systemic risks relevant to their services, in particular
                    those related to the dissemination of illegal and harmful
                    content, any negative effects on the exercise of fundamental
                    rights, as well as any negative effect on public security,
                    public health, and minors."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Digital Services Act (DSA) is another legislative
                    package that will place restrictions on how tech giants
                    operate. In this case, the DSA focuses much more on online
                    content and moderation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a nutshell, the DSA puts additional responsibility on
                    online platforms and tech companies to police content,
                    including both reporting and taking down illegal content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the provisions of the DSA, regulations will be
                    applied on companies in tiers. The largest firms including
                    those with more than 45 million active users across Europe
                    will see the biggest effects. Apple falls into that
                    category, but it has argued that iMessage specifically does
                    not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, the DSA will ban "dark patterns," or
                    misleading user interfaces such as those that coerce users
                    into subscribing to a platform or making an in-app purchase.

                    I was leaving the local butcher shop the other week when a
                    bigger carnivore blocked my path: The driver of a Ford
                    pickup was struggling to park his rig. It was the most-super
                    of Super Duties — a crew cab long-box dually — so it took
                    him a couple of minutes and several cuts of the wheel to
                    ease the beast into a prime spot near the store entrance. He
                    was holding up a lot of traffic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's a tight parking lot, with spaces 8-8½ feet wide. And
                    the width of that dually at the hips? Also 8 feet. What was
                    he thinking? Other than, "I'd rather do this than go find an
                    easy spot on the back row and walk 50 yards." Maybe he had a
                    bum knee. Doesn't make his truck any smaller.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Granted, this was over the holidays, when parking lots get a
                    little nuts. But why do drivers of big pickups or jumbo SUVs
                    try to park among the normies?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We've all been in this situation: You return to your vehicle
                    to discover somebody parked too close. You have to crawl in
                    through the back hatch, or enter on the passenger side and
                    clamber over the center console. Sometimes this is simply
                    because of a bad parking job. Sometimes, a vehicle has been
                    jammed into a space where it honestly doesn't fit.

                    While lightsails are being investigated for rapid-transit
                    missions within the solar system and Proxima Centauri, they
                    cannot make the necessary propulsive maneuvers in deep
                    space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nuclear concepts that are possible with current technology
                    include nuclear-thermal and nuclear-electric propulsion
                    (NTP/NEP), which have the necessary thrust to reach
                    locations in deep space. However, as Bickford and his team
                    noted, they are also large, heavy, and expensive to
                    manufacture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In contrast, we propose a thin film nuclear isotope engine
                    with sufficient capability to search, rendezvous, and then
                    return samples from distant and rapidly moving interstellar
                    objects," they write. "The same technology allows a
                    gravitational lens telescope to be repointed so a single
                    mission could observe numerous high-value targets."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The basic concept is similar to a solar sail, except that it
                    relies on thin sheets of a radioactive isotope that uses the
                    momentum of its decay products to generate thrust.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As they describe it, the baseline design incorporates sheets
                    of the Thorium-228 measuring about ~10 micrometers (0.01 mm)
                    thick. This naturally radioactive metal (typically used in
                    radiation therapy) undergoes alpha decay with a half-life of
                    1.9 years. Thrust is produced by coating one side with a
                    ~50-micrometer (0.05 mm) thick absorber layer, forcing alpha
                    particles in the direction opposite of travel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spacecraft would require 30 kg (66 lbs) of Thorium-228
                    spread over an area measuring over 250 m2 (~2,700 square
                    feet), providing more than 150 km/s (93 mi/s) of thrust.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For comparison, the fastest mission that relied on
                    conventional propulsion was the Parker Solar Probe (PSP),
                    which achieved a velocity of 163 km/s (101 mi/s) as it
                    reached the closest point in its orbit around the sun
                    (perihelion). However, this was because of the
                    gravity-assist maneuver with Venus and the pull of the sun's
                    gravity.

                    researchers have found there are two key reasons people
                    choose to be anonymous online – self-expression or toxic
                    behaviour.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A team led by PhD candidate Lewis Nitschinsk from UQ's
                    School of Psychology collected data from more than 1,300
                    participants across the globe via an online survey and daily
                    diary, where they tracked their online behaviour over a
                    week. "Our study specifically looked at what people do
                    online when they're anonymous, as opposed to when they make
                    themselves identifiable," Mr Nitschinsk said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mr Nitschinsk said the results help understand the
                    complexities of how people interact online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Learning about different motivations means we can be better
                    informed about potential benefits and risks of being
                    anonymous online, and interacting with other anonymous
                    people in online communities," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The next stage of our research is to understand how seeking
                    anonymity is associated with one's wellbeing and how
                    anonymous online behaviour differs across cultures."

                    of the country's universities and more than 30 government

                    Primula customers have said that January salaries were

                    Last year, a breach at British payroll company Zellis led to

                    including payroll for nearly 170 government agencies. The

                Major Windows compromises like this seem to be written up daily
                in cybersecurity news. This post is not to single out Teitoevry
                specifically. Instead, the takeaway should be about the futility
                and irresponsibility of deploying M$ Windows in ether a
                networked or a production environment, especially since
                appropriate alternatives have existed since the dawn of the
                Internet. As usual, the spin is to conflate successful breaches
                and attacks. That conflation has the apparent goal of making the
                public complacent and accepting avoidable compromises as
                unavoidable.

                    gaining views on rival platform Instagram Threads shows X
                    search results where numerous bots, including many verified
                    with a blue check, are posting a variation of the phrase
                    "I'm sorry, I cannot provide a response as it goes against
                    OpenAI's use case policy."

                  <p>
                    The response is what OpenAI's chatbot says when a user asks
                    a question or requests that it perform a task in violation
                    of OpenAI's terms of service. In this case, it's also an
                    indication that the X account in question is using AI to
                    create its posts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It does appear that at least some of the bot accounts
                    are older, according to the "join date" that's displayed on
                    their X profile. You can view one
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/maddiehilton3">example</a> of
                    this here, for instance (see below). These accounts also
                    post content that reads as if it's the output of some AI
                    query, as it most likely is.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Despite the numerous posts from these bots, AI-powered
                    accounts aren't X's only problem. Many bots and bot farms
                    are run without OpenAI's assistance, and are harder to
                    detect. According to data pulled from
                    <a href="https://fedica.com/">Fedica</a>, a social media
                    analytics and publishing platform, only 202 accounts posted
                    OpenAI's automated response over the past 30 days,
                    <a href="https://fedica.com/hashtag/2EC0A910EA3453"
                      >as seen in this query here</a
                    >. While a few were from real people joking about the bot
                    problem, the majority were AI responses. More bots may have
                    already been deleted by X, but that data isn't available.

                    Two insect-like robots, a mini-bug and a water strider,
                    developed at Washington State University, are the smallest,
                    lightest and fastest fully functional micro-robots ever
                    known to be created.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such miniature robots could someday be used for work in
                    areas such as artificial pollination, search and rescue,
                    environmental monitoring, micro-fabrication or
                    robotic-assisted surgery. Reporting on their work in the
                    proceedings of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society's
                    International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems,
                    the mini-bug weighs in at eight milligrams while the water
                    strider weighs 55 milligrams. Both can move at about six
                    millimeters a second.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That is fast compared to other micro-robots at this scale,
                    although it still lags behind their biological relatives,"
                    said Conor Trygstad, a Ph.D. student in the School of
                    Mechanical and Materials Engineering and lead author on the
                    work. An ant typically weighs up to five milligrams and can
                    move at almost a meter per second.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The key to the tiny robots is their tiny actuators that make
                    the robots move. Trygstad used a new fabrication technique
                    to miniaturize the actuator down to less than a milligram,
                    the smallest ever known to have been made.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The actuators are the smallest and fastest ever developed
                    for micro-robotics," said Néstor O. Pérez-Arancibia,
                    Flaherty Associate Professor in Engineering at WSU's School
                    of Mechanical and Materials Engineering who led the project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The actuator uses a material called a shape memory alloy
                    that is able to change shapes when it's heated. It is called
                    'shape memory' because it remembers and then returns to its
                    original shape. Unlike a typical motor that would move a
                    robot, these alloys don't have any moving parts or spinning
                    components.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "They're very mechanically sound," said Trygstad. "The
                    development of the very lightweight actuator opens up new
                    realms in micro-robotics."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shape memory alloys are not generally used for large-scale
                    robotic movement because they are too slow. In the case of
                    the WSU robots, however, the actuators are made of two tiny
                    shape memory alloy wires that are 1/1000 of an inch in
                    diameter. With a small amount of current, the wires can be
                    heated up and cooled easily, allowing the robots to flap
                    their fins or move their feet at up to 40 times per second.
                    In preliminary tests, the actuator was also able to lift
                    more than 150 times its own weight.

                    [...] why did the left hand (LH) mid-exit door plug blow off
                    of the 737-9 registered as N704AL? Simple- as has been
                    covered in a number of articles and videos across aviation
                    channels, there are 4 bolts that prevent the mid-exit door
                    plug from sliding up off of the door stop fittings that take
                    the actual pressurization loads in flight, and these 4 bolts
                    were not installed when Boeing delivered the airplane, our
                    own records reflect this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result, this check job that should find minimal defects
                    has in the past 365 calendar days recorded 392 nonconforming
                    findings on 737 mid fuselage door installations (so both
                    actual doors for the high density configs, and plugs like
                    the one that blew out). That is a hideously high and very
                    alarming number, and if our quality system on 737 was
                    healthy, it would have stopped the line and driven the issue
                    back to supplier after the first few instances.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The mid-exit doors on a 737-9 of both the regular and plug
                    variety come from Spirit already installed in what is
                    supposed to be the final configuration and in the Renton
                    factory, there is a job for the doors team to verify this
                    "final" install and rigging meets drawing requirements. In a
                    healthy production system, this would be a "belt and
                    suspenders" sort of check, but the 737 production system is
                    quite far from healthy, its a rambling, shambling, disaster
                    waiting to happen. As a result, this check job that should
                    find minimal defects has in the past 365 calendar days
                    recorded 392 nonconforming findings on 737 mid fuselage door
                    installations (so both actual doors for the high density
                    configs, and plugs like the one that blew out). That is a
                    hideously high and very alarming number, and if our quality
                    system on 737 was healthy, it would have stopped the line
                    and driven the issue back to supplier after the first few
                    instances. Obviously, this did not happen. Now, on the
                    incident aircraft this check job was completed on 31 August
                    2023, and did turn up discrepancies, but on the RH side
                    door, not the LH that actually failed. I could blame the
                    team for missing certain details, but given the enormous
                    volume of defects they were already finding and fixing, it
                    was inevitable something would slip through- and on the
                    incident aircraft something did. I know what you are
                    thinking at this point, but grab some popcorn because there
                    is a plot twist coming up. [....]

                    We conduct the first large-scale user study examining how
                    users interact with an AI Code assistant to solve a variety
                    of security related tasks across different programming
                    languages. Overall, we find that participants who had access
                    to an AI assistant based on OpenAI's codex-davinci-002 model
                    wrote significantly less secure code than those without
                    access. Additionally, participants with access to an AI
                    assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code
                    than those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore,
                    we find that participants who trusted the AI less and
                    engaged more with the language and format of their prompts
                    (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with
                    fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better
                    inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we
                    provide an in-depth analysis of participants' language and
                    interaction behavior, as well as release our user interface
                    as an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future.

                    chromosome and others had the usual two, known as mosaic
                    Turner syndrome. Women with Turner syndrome generally
                    undergo human growth hormone and estrogen replacement
                    therapy to boost height and trigger the onset of puberty,
                    respectively. The remains included a partial skull, which
                    showed marked pitting in the orbits—evidence of chronic
                    intestinal hemorrhage, often the result of anemia, although
                    there is a possible link with Turner syndrome. Osteological
                    analysis revealed evidence of delayed growth, and the woman
                    was unlikely to have gone through puberty and started
                    menstruating.

                    The male infant had an extra chromosome 21 (a sign of Down
                    syndrome) and was found at the Wetwang Slack site, buried in
                    the ditch of a square barrow along with an adult female,
                    although the two were not necessarily related since infants
                    were often buried in existing burrows, per the authors. The
                    skeleton with an extra Y chromosome also showed osteological
                    evidence consistent with Jacobs syndrome (male, 46+ years,
                    dated 680 to 890 CE); it was found at the Lincoln Eastern
                    Bypass site in Lincolnshire.

                    The three skeletons that showed evidence of Klinefelter
                    syndrome were all buried during different periods according
                    to the burial customs of their day. One skeleton (male,
                    17–19 years, circa 450 BCE) was found at an Iron Age
                    cemetery site called Wetwang Slack in Yorkshire; another
                    (male, 36–45, 12th–13th century) came from a medieval
                    cemetery under Longwall Quad at Magdalen College, Oxford;
                    and yet another (16–19 years, 18th–19th century) was found
                    at Trinity Burial Ground in Kingston upon Hull. All three
                    skeletons showed signs of delayed puberty and were slightly
                    taller than average for their time, consistent with the
                    genetic evidence showing extra X chromosomes.

                    Vard Group is part of NuProShip, a consortium of the
                    Norwegian maritime authority, universities, shipbuilders,
                    and shipping companies that aims to develop a Generation IV
                    reactor for marine vessels. The group has shortlisted three
                    designs and plan to have picked one by the end of 2024.<br />...<br />
                      Now, the immense scale of shipping's decarbonization
                    challenge, along with new reactor technologies, are
                    prompting a reevaluation of nuclear merchant ships. In fact,
                    for commercial shippers, there aren't any realistic
                    alternatives to nuclear, says Jan Emblemsvåg, professor of
                    ocean operations and civil engineering at the Norwegian
                    University of Science and Technology. "Engines in ordinary
                    ships are the size of houses," says Emblemsvåg, who is
                    leading NuProShip. And a great deal of space is taken up by
                    fuel: "A container vessel going from Amsterdam to Shanghai
                    requires roughly 4,000 tonnes of fuel."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An SMR would be much more compact and lightweight. According
                    to Emblemsvåg, a molten-salt reactor—which uses a mixture of
                    thorium and hot liquid salts as both fuel and coolant—would
                    also save about $70 million over the lifetime of a ship,
                    compared with a similar vessel powered by engines that burn
                    diesel fuel (or, more precisely, heavy fuel oil). Another
                    plus for nuclear-propelled ships is easy access to an
                    endless supply of cooling water.

                    As the prospects for news publishers waned in the last
                    decade, billionaires swooped in to buy some of the country's
                    most fabled brands. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon,

                    The Washington Post in 2013 for about $250 million. Dr.
                    Patrick Soon-Shiong, a biotechnology and start-up
                    billionaire,

                    The Los Angeles Times in 2018 for $500 million. Marc
                    Benioff, the founder of the software giant Salesforce,
                    purchased Time magazine with his wife, Lynne, for $190
                    million in 2018.

                    [...] But it increasingly looks like the billionaires are
                    struggling just like nearly everyone else. Time, The
                    Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times all lost millions
                    of dollars last year, people with knowledge of the
                    companies' finances have said, after considerable investment
                    from their owners and intensive efforts to drum up new
                    revenue streams.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the middle of last year, The Times was on track to
                    lose $30 million to $40 million in 2023, according to three
                    people with knowledge of the projections. Last year, the
                    company cut about 74 jobs, and executives have met in recent
                    days to discuss the possibility of deep job cuts, according
                    to two other people familiar with the conversations. Members
                    of The Los Angeles Times union have called an emergency
                    meeting for Thursday to discuss the possibility of another
                    "major" round of layoffs: "This is the big one," read the
                    email to employees.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mr. Bezos hasn't fared much better at The Washington
                    Post. Like many news organizations, The Post has struggled
                    to hold onto the momentum it gained in the wake of the 2020
                    election. Sagging subscriptions and advertising revenue led
                    to losses of about $100 million last year. At the end of the
                    year, the company eliminated 240 of its 2,500 jobs through
                    buyouts, including some of its well-regarded journalists.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Time is facing similar headwinds. The publication lost
                    around $20 million in 2023, according to two people with
                    knowledge of the publication's financial picture. Time has
                    weighed cutting costs in the first quarter of the year to
                    help offset some of the losses, one of the people said.

                    with the approaching end-of-life (EOL) of CentOS Stream 8,
                    enterprises may face critical challenges in securing their
                    Linux environment. This analysis provides insights into the
                    potential consequences of CentOS Stream 8 EOL, discusses
                    mitigation strategies, and examines the importance of
                    maintaining security in enterprise environments.

                  <p>
                    CentOS Stream 8, released alongside CentOS 8, has become a
                    stable and reliable platform for many enterprise users.
                    However, with the end of support for CentOS 8, users have
                    migrated to CentOS Stream as a viable alternative.
                    Unfortunately, CentOS Stream 8 will also reach its EOL on
                    May 31, 2024. This poses significant challenges in the areas
                    of security, support, and

                    issues may arise for enterprises operating in regulated
                    environments, as such industries often require the use of

                    The implications and long-term consequences of using CentOS
                    Stream 8 beyond its EOL could be severe. One of the key
                    implications is the lack of security updates, leaving
                    enterprise systems vulnerable to potential threats. The
                    absence of official support further intensifies the risk of
                    compatibility issues and increased downtime. This raises
                    important questions: How can enterprises protect their
                    systems from cyber threats without security updates? How can
                    they ensure compliance and data security without official
                    support?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Luckily, mitigation strategies exist for CentOS Stream 8
                    EOL, including migration to other long-term supported
                    operating systems such as CentOS Stream 9, AlmaLinux, Oracle
                    Linux, RHEL, or Rocky Linux. However, a careful and
                    strategic planning process is essential to minimize
                    disruptions during the migration process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These challenges ultimately call for careful planning,
                    strategic decision-making, and a proactive approach to
                    maintaining security in enterprise environments. It is
                    crucial for security practitioners to assess the specific
                    needs of their organizations and determine the most suitable
                    path forward to ensure ongoing data security and compliance.

                    Researchers have linked the travels of a 14,000-year-old
                    wooly mammoth with the oldest known human settlements in
                    Alaska, providing clues about the relationship between the
                    iconic species and some of the earliest people to travel
                    across the Bering Land Bridge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists made those connections by using isotope analysis
                    to study the life of a female mammoth, named Élmayųujey'eh,
                    by the Healy Lake Village Council. A tusk from Elma was
                    discovered at the Swan Point archaeological site in Interior
                    Alaska. Samples from the tusk revealed details about Elma
                    and the roughly 1,000-kilometer journey she took through
                    Alaska and northwestern Canada during her lifetime.

                  <p>
                    Isotopic data, along with DNA from other mammoths at the
                    site and archaeological evidence, indicates that early
                    Alaskans likely structured their settlements to overlap with
                    areas where mammoths congregated. Those findings,
                    highlighted in the journal Science Advances, provide
                    evidence that mammoths and early hunter-gatherers shared
                    habitat in the region. The long-term predictable presence of
                    wooly mammoths would have attracted humans to the area.

                    "She wandered around the densest region of archaeological
                    sites in Alaska," said Audrey Rowe, a University of Alaska
                    Fairbanks Ph.D. student and lead author of the paper. "It
                    looks like these early people were establishing hunting
                    camps in areas that were frequented by mammoths."

                    The mammoth tusk was excavated and identified in 2009 by
                    Charles Holmes, affiliate research professor of anthropology
                    at UAF, and François Lanoë, research associate in
                    archaeology at the University of Alaska Museum of the North.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found Elma's tusk and the remains of two related
                    juvenile mammoths, along with evidence of campfires, the use
                    of stone tools, and butchered remains of other game. All of
                    this "indicates a pattern consistent with human hunting of
                    mammoths," said Ben Potter, an archaeologist and professor
                    of anthropology at UAF.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    One evening in June 2023, Nicholas Wise, a fluid dynamics
                    researcher / scientific fraud buster, was digging around on
                    shady Facebook groups where he found someone calling
                    themselves Jack Ben, of a firm whose Chinese name translates
                    to Olive Academic, offering journal editors large sums of
                    cash in return for accepting papers for publication...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] At least tens of millions of dollars flow to the paper
                    mill industry each year, estimates Matt Hodgkinson of the
                    independent charity UK Research Integrity Office, which
                    offers support to further good research practices, who is
                    also a council member at the nonprofit Committee on
                    Publication Ethics. Publishers and journals, recognizing the
                    threat, have beefed up their research integrity teams and
                    retracted papers, sometimes by the hundreds. They are
                    investing in ways to better spot third-party involvement,
                    such as screening tools meant to flag bogus papers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So cash-rich paper mills have evidently adopted a new
                    tactic: bribing editors and planting their own agents on
                    editorial boards to ensure publication of their manuscripts.
                    An investigation by Science and Retraction Watch, in
                    partnership with Wise and other industry experts, identified
                    several paper mills and more than 30 editors of reputable
                    journals who appear to be involved in this type of activity.
                    Many were guest editors of special issues, which have been
                    flagged in the past as particularly vulnerable to abuse
                    because they are edited separately from the regular journal.
                    But several were regular editors or members of journal
                    editorial boards. And this is likely just the tip of the
                    iceberg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hodgkinson recalls hearing one publisher say it "had to sack
                    300 editors for manipulative behavior." He adds, "These are
                    organized crime rings that are committing large-scale
                    fraud."

                    A new survey of thousands of game development professionals
                    finds a near-majority saying generative AI tools are already
                    in use at their workplace. But a significant minority of
                    developers say their company has no interest in generative
                    AI tools or has outright banned their use.

                      report</a
                    >, released Thursday, aggregates the thoughts of over 3,000
                    industry professionals as of last October. While the annual
                    survey (conducted in conjunction with research partner
                    Omdia) has been running for 12 years, this is the first time
                    respondents were asked directly about their use of
                    generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, GitHub Copilot,
                    and Adobe Generative Fill.

                  <p>
                    Forty-nine percent of the survey's developer respondents
                    said that generative AI tools are currently being used in
                    their workplace.<br />[...]<br />The wide embrace of AI
                    tools hasn't seemed to lessen worries about their use among
                    developers, though. A full 42 percent of respondents said
                    they were "very concerned" about the ethics of using
                    generative AI in game development, with an additional 42
                    percent being "somewhat concerned." Only 12 percent said
                    they were "not concerned at all" about those usage ethics.

                    According to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, TSMC chair
                    Mark Liu

                    that construction continues, but it will not be mass

                    expects it to be fully operational by 2027 or 2028, though
                    it gave no specific reasons for the delay.

                  <p>
                    Liu also said that the new factory may not be dedicated to
                    3nm production. He said that the specific chip type had yet
                    to be determined, and that the choice would be affected both
                    by customer demand and government incentives.

                    The reference to initiatives is not the only factor in
                    TSMC's relationship with the US government. As TSMC is a
                    Taiwanese company and the US does not have an income tax
                    agreement with that country, the chip manufacturer faces
                    double taxation.

                  <p>
                    Unless this changes, it's been reported that TSMC would
                    therefore be paying out

                    Machine tools – machines that cut or form metal – are the
                    heart of industrial civilization. Sometimes called "mother
                    machines" (because they're machines that make other
                    machines), machine tools are required to make almost
                    everything. Nearly every manufactured good is made using
                    machine tools, or by machines which were made using machine
                    tools:

                    Being able to manufacture machine tools is often considered
                    an important capability for an industrialized country. Not
                    only does this provide ready access to the latest
                    manufacturing technology, but it ensures production of
                    munitions and other military equipment won't be bottlenecked
                    by a lack of machine tools. This isn't a hypothetical
                    concern: American production of artillery shells for Ukraine
                    has been held back by a lack of machine tools. The military
                    has thus historically paid close attention to the machine
                    tool industry and the availability of machinists.

                    For most of the 20th century, the US was unrivaled in its
                    machine tool technology, and as late as the early 1980s it
                    was the largest machine tool producer in the world.. But
                    almost overnight, the industry collapsed: annual machine
                    tool shipments declined by more than 50% in 2 years,
                    hundreds of machine tool companies went out of business, and
                    the US slipped from the largest producer in the world to the
                    4th or 5th (depending on the year), roughly where it remains
                    today.

                    Japan's SLIM "Moon Sniper" spacecraft made a successful
                    lunar landing Friday, making the country just the fifth to
                    robotically land on the moon.

                  <p>
                    The Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) spacecraft
                    began its descent from a 15-kilometer perilune shortly after
                    10:00 a.m. Eastern, Jan. 19 (1500 UTC), decelerating from a
                    speed of around 1,700 meters per second.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    SLIM appeared to have successfully touched down at 10:20
                    a.m. (1520 UTC), during a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency
                    (JAXA)

                    of the event. It was not however immediately clear if the
                    landing was successful, with the livestream ending
                    inconclusively. A wait of more than an hour followed for
                    clarification and confirmation.

                    appeared to show signals from both SLIM and the Lunar
                    Excursion Vehicle 1 (LEV-1)—a small rover accompanying SLIM
                    and ejected onto the surface at an altitude of two
                    meters—being received in Madrid. Amateur tracking stations
                    meanwhile reported signals from both SLIM and LEV-1.

                  <p>
                    JAXA confirmed landing success during a press conference
                    just under two hours after the landing occurred. However the
                    spacecraft's solar cells were not generating electricity.
                    The reason for the solar cell issue was not immediately
                    known, but spacecraft orientation—suggesting the lander may
                    have rolled—is consider a possibility. SLIM is currently
                    working on battery power.

                  <p>
                    "We believe that the soft landing itself was successful," a
                    JAXA official said, stating that the spacecraft had survived
                    the landing and was sending data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Teams are working to maximize data gathering and science
                    output. LEV-1 and another rover, LEV-2, were also confirmed
                    to have separated successfully and operating. JAXA will said
                    it will hold another press conference in the following week.

                    Five crushable, 3D-printed aluminum lattice landing legs
                    helped the lander absorb the impact of touchdown on the
                    lunar surface.

                  <p>
                    The mission was primarily aiming to demonstrate precise
                    landing technology, allowing the spacecraft to set down
                    within 100 meters of a target point. SLIM was targeting a
                    landing on the sloped rim inside the 300-meters-wide Shioli
                    crater.

                  <p>
                    While the landing was confirmed successful, it will take up
                    to a month to confirm the success or failure of the
                    "pinpoint" landing. The accuracy will be assessed with
                    observations from lunar orbit.

                    While sutures and staples suffice for closing most wounds,
                    they can damage delicate tissue, plus they may allow fluids
                    to leak out when applied to internal organs. Scientists have
                    thus set about improving an alternative wound-closure method
                    known as tissue soldering.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Putting it simply, tissue soldering is an experimental
                    technique in which a gelatinous paste is applied to the
                    pressed-together edges of a wound, then heated with a laser.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The heat causes the paste to polymerize and bond with the
                    collagen in the underlying tissue, forming a flexible
                    watertight seal which holds the wound closed until it heals.
                    Not only is the process typically faster yet gentler than
                    applying sutures or staples, it also produces less
                    inflammation, less scarring, and provides better protection
                    against infections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That said, complications may occur if the paste isn't heated
                    to just the right temperature. If it's too cold, it won't
                    bond with the tissue properly, whereas if it's too hot, it
                    will burn the tissue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an effort to address that problem, scientists from
                    Switzerland's Empa and ETH Zurich research institutes have
                    developed an albumin-based paste called iSolder (intelligent
                    solder). It contains titanium nitride and bismuth vanadate
                    nanoparticles – the former convert laser light into heat,
                    whereas the latter fluoresce when heated to a precise
                    temperature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, when a gelatinous sheet of the iSolder is applied to a
                    wound and then exposed to laser light, it will visibly glow
                    upon reaching the just-right temperature at which it bonds
                    with the underlying tissue. This takes the guesswork out of
                    tissue welding – surgeons just keep applying the laser light
                    until the paste glows, then stop when it does.

                    Russia-state hackers exploited a weak password to compromise
                    Microsoft's corporate network and accessed emails and
                    documents that belonged to senior executives and employees
                    working in security and legal teams, Microsoft said late
                    Friday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The attack, which Microsoft attributed to a Kremlin-backed
                    hacking group it tracks as Midnight Blizzard, is at least
                    the second time in as many years that failures to follow
                    basic security hygiene has resulted in a breach that has the
                    potential to harm customers. One paragraph in
                    <a href="link">Friday's disclosure</a>, filed with the
                    Securities and Exchange Commission, was gobsmacking:

                        Beginning in late November 2023, the threat actor used a
                        password spray attack to compromise a legacy
                        non-production test tenant account and gain a foothold,
                        and then used the account's permissions to access a very
                        small percentage of Microsoft corporate email accounts,
                        including members of our senior leadership team and
                        employees in our cybersecurity, legal, and other
                        functions, and exfiltrated some emails and attached
                        documents. The investigation indicates they were
                        initially targeting email accounts for information
                        related to Midnight Blizzard itself. We are in the
                        process of notifying employees whose email was accessed.

                    Microsoft didn't detect the breach until January 12, exactly
                    a week before Friday's disclosure. Microsoft's account
                    raises the prospect that the Russian hackers had
                    uninterrupted access to the accounts for as long as two
                    months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A translation of the 93 words quoted above: A device inside
                    Microsoft's network was protected by a weak password with no
                    form of two-factor authentication employed. The Russian
                    adversary group was able to guess it by peppering it with
                    previously compromised or commonly used passwords until they
                    finally landed on the right one. The threat actor then
                    accessed the account, indicating that either 2FA wasn't
                    employed or the protection was somehow bypassed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, this "legacy non-production test tenant
                    account" was somehow configured so that Midnight Blizzard
                    could pivot and gain access to some of the company's most
                    senior and sensitive employee accounts.

                        A lot of fascinating implications here. A successful
                        password spray attack suggests no 2FA and either reused
                        or weak passwords. Access to email accounts belonging to
                        "senior leadership... cybersecurity, and legal" teams
                        using just the permissions of a "test tenant account"
                        suggests that someone gave that test account amazing
                        privileges. Why? Why wasn't it removed when the test was
                        over? I also note that it took Microsoft about seven
                        weeks to detect the attack.

                    lieu of the 60-day applicable notice period under the [union
                    contract]."

                  <p>
                    [...] The outlet's website had a smattering of fresh stories
                    Friday, suggesting a skeleton crew was still employed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, SI's annual Swimsuit edition – which launched the
                    careers of supermodels from Cheryl Tiegs to Tyra Banks – has
                    been completed and will be released in the spring, a source
                    close to the situation told The Post.

                    From a period of time between February 2023 and July 25th,
                    2023, one such repository was GitHub's own
                    actions/runner-images repository. You might be able to guess
                    where this story this is going. This is the story of how I
                    discovered and exploited a Critical misconfiguration
                    vulnerability and reported it to GitHub. The vulnerability
                    provided access to internal GitHub infrastructure as well as
                    secrets. There was also a very high likelihood that this
                    access could be used to insert malicious code into all of
                    GitHub's runner base images – allowing an attacker to
                    conduct a supply chain attack against every GitHub customer
                    that used hosted runners.
