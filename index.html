                    [...] With erect knotweed, Mueller experienced a
                    breakthrough of sorts. Based on four seasons of
                    observations, Mueller determined that growing wild plants in
                    the low-density conditions typical of a cultivated garden
                    (i.e. spaced out and weeded) triggers plants to produce
                    seeds that germinate more easily. This makes the harvests
                    easier to plant successfully the next time around,
                    eliminating a key barrier to further selection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our results show that erect knotweed grown in low-density
                    agroecosystems spontaneously 'act domesticated' in a single
                    growing season, before any selection has occurred," Mueller
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Think of it as the plant equivalent to that first wolf who,
                    though still a wild animal, sat down with its human friend
                    around the fire. This is a behavioral shift, rather than an
                    evolutionary one, but it allows new evolutionary pathways to
                    open up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "You can't explain plant domestication if you only
                    consider the behaviors of humans, because domestication is
                    the result of reciprocal relationships between multiple
                    species that are all capable of responding to each other,"
                    Mueller said.

                    The Occamy processor, which uses a chiplet architecture,
                    packs 432 RISC-V and AI accelerators and comes with 32GB of
                    HBM2E memory, has taped out. The chip is backed by the
                    European Space Agency and developed by engineers from ETH
                    Zürich and the University of Bologna, reports
                    <a
                      href="https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/05/08/european-processor-designed-for-use-in-space-taped-out/"

                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ESA-backed Occamy processor uses two chiplets with 216
                    32-bit RISC-V cores, an unknown number of 64-bit FPUs for
                    matrix calculations, and carries two 16GB HBM2E memory
                    packages from Micron. The cores are interconnected using a
                    silicon interposer, and the dual-tile CPU can deliver 0.75
                    FP64 TFLOPS of performance and 6 FP8 TFLOPS of compute
                    capability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Neither ESA nor its development partners have disclosed the
                    Occamy CPUs' power consumption, but it is said that the chip
                    can be passively cooled, meaning it might be a low-power
                    processor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each Occamy chiplet has 216 RISC-V cores and matrix FPUs,
                    totaling around a billion transistors spread over 73mm^2 of
                    silicon. The tiles are made by GlobalFoundries using its
                    14LPP fabrication process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 73mm^2 chiplet isn't a particularly large die. For
                    example, Intel's Alder Lake (with six high-performance
                    cores) has a die size of 163 mm^2. As far as performance is
                    concerned, Nvidia's A30 GPU with 24GB of HBM2 memory
                    delivers 5.2 FP64/10.3 FP64 Tensor TFLOPS as well as 330/660
                    (with sparsity) INT8 TOPS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, one of the advantages of chiplet designs is that
                    ESA and its partners from ETH Zürich and the University of
                    Bologna can add other chiplets to the package to accelerate
                    certain workloads if needed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Occamy CPU is developed as a part of the EuPilot
                    program, and it is one of many chips that the ESA is
                    considering for spaceflight computing. However, there are no
                    guarantees that the process will indeed be used onboard
                    spaceships.

                    The researchers used blood samples from a subset of the
                    patients to look at immune responses and compare them with
                    those from matched vaccinated controls. They first compared
                    antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and found no evidence of
                    "overexuberant" or enhanced antibody responses against the
                    virus that might explain the myocarditis and pericarditis.
                    The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in the two groups
                    were comparable, with the patients with the heart condition
                    having comparable, if not slightly blunted, antibody
                    responses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers next screened for auto-antibodies, that is,
                    antibodies spurred by the vaccine that are misdirected
                    against a person's body rather than the virus. They used an
                    established screening tool to scan for autoantibodies
                    against over 6,000 human proteins and molecules. The
                    researchers focused on over 500 of the probes that relate to
                    cardiac tissue. They found no relative increase in the
                    number of autoantibodies compared with the controls,
                    suggesting that an autoimmune response was unlikely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers then took a broad, unbiased approach to
                    compare the profiles of immune responses among the patients
                    and controls. They found distinct immune signatures between
                    the two groups, with patients showing elevated levels of
                    immune signaling chemicals (cytokines) that are linked to
                    acute, systemic inflammation. And those cytokines were
                    accompanied by corresponding elevations in inflammatory
                    cellular responses, particularly cytotoxic T cells. Further,
                    the gene expression profiles of those T cells showed the
                    potential to cause heart tissue damage.

                  <p>
                    Taken together, the researchers concluded that the most
                    likely explanation is that in these rare cases of
                    myocarditis and pericarditis, the vaccine is spurring a
                    generalized, vigorous inflammatory response that leads to
                    heart tissue inflammation and damage.

                    [...] For now, the finding that an inflammatory response is
                    behind the cases can help guide treatment and prevention. A
                    Canadian study from last year suggested that extending

                    >
                    can reduce the chances of myocarditis and pericarditis in
                    young males. But, the new study may bring some relief when
                    it does occur—self-resolving inflammation is less concerning
                    than a difficult-to-treat autoimmune response.

                    In documents filed in a Manhattan federal court, lawyers
                    from the law firm Cohen &amp; Gresser LLP shared
                    Bankman-Fried's first official legal defense. Lawyers
                    accused the US of a "troubling" and "classic rush to
                    judgment," claiming that the government didn't even wait to
                    receive "millions of documents" and "other evidence" against
                    Bankman-Fried before "improperly seeking" to turn "civil and

                    pleaded not guilty. Now, in his motion to dismiss,
                    Bankman-Fried has requested an oral argument to "fight these
                    baseless charges" and "clear his name." He's asking the
                    court to dismiss 10 out of 13 charges, arguing that federal
                    prosecutors have failed to substantiate most of their
                    claims.

                    Australian lawmakers have met United States Ambassador
                    Caroline Kennedy, urging her to help drop the pending
                    extradition case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange
                    and allow him to return to Australia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The "Bring Julian Assange Home Parliamentary Group" said on
                    Tuesday it informed Kennedy of "the widespread concern in
                    Australia" about the continued detention of Assange, an
                    Australian citizen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The meeting comes before US President Joe Biden's scheduled
                    visit to Australia this month for the Quad leaders' summit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There are a range of views about Assange in the Australian
                    community and the members of the Parliamentary Group reflect
                    that diversity of views. But what is not in dispute in the
                    Group is that Mr Assange is being treated unjustly," the
                    legislators said in a statement after meeting Kennedy in the
                    capital, Canberra.

                    Assange is battling extradition from the United Kingdom to
                    the US where he is wanted on criminal charges over the
                    release of confidential military records and diplomatic
                    cables in 2010. Washington says the release of the documents
                    had put lives in danger.

                    the community, to shift focus from treatment of late-stage

                    Effective prediction in real-world settings will rely on the
                    quality of patients' medical histories. Future AI-based
                    screening tools for pancreatic cancer will have to be
                    trained on specific local population data, the study found.
                    A model trained on data from Danish patients, for example,
                    was not as accurate when applied to US patients.

                    "Given the experience in Denmark and one or two US health
                    systems, this means that in each country with different
                    conditions and different systems, it is best to re-train the
                    model locally. AI needs a lot of data to train. Access in
                    different locations is not straightforward, as medical
                    records are and should be confidential. So local approval
                    and data security is essential," Sander said.

                  <p>
                    The study is still in its early stages, and the software

                    are needed before even a trial can be conducted.

                    A heavier, cheaper battery might be preferable in some
                    circumstances, like for the smaller, lower-range EVs common
                    in China. JAC's announced range is comparable to that of the

                    A somewhat easier market for sodium-ion batteries might be
                    stationary storage installations, like those used to provide
                    backup power for a home or business or on the electrical
                    grid. Some companies, like US-based
                    <a href="https://natron.energy/">Natron</a>, are developing
                    the chemistry specifically for stationary applications,
                    where size and weight aren't as critical as they are in a
                    moving car.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But if market conditions have opened the door for
                    lithium alternatives, they could just as easily slam it
                    shut. The fate of sodium-ion batteries will likely be
                    "directly tied to the cost of lithium," says Jay Whitacre, a
                    battery researcher at Carnegie Mellon University and
                    previous founder of a sodium-ion battery company called
                    Aquion.

                  <p>
                    [...] Sodium could end up in EV batteries in China as early
                    as the end of this year, but the technology probably won't
                    overthrow lithium. Rather, the world of batteries will
                    likely continue to branch out and diversify, with companies
                    developing more battery options for different situations.
                    There are "nooks and crannies" in the battery market, as
                    Whitacre puts it, and soon, sodium-ion might finally find
                    its place.

                    <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets</em>. And the
                    concern isn't theoretical: a subset of the oldest known
                    Martian meteorites appear to have already had their magnetic
                    memories wiped, the team showed.

                    [...] Planetary scientist Foteini Vervelidou uses meteorites
                    from Mars — chunks of the planet that were blasted into
                    space by an impact and later captured by Earth's gravity —
                    to study its ancient past. Just
                    <a href="https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/">a few hundred</a>
                    are known to exist. Rarer still are specimens that contain
                    minerals carrying imprints of

                      href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sad-magnetic-state-solar-systems-rocky-worlds"

                    >
                    about 3.7 billion years ago (<em>SN: 9/7/15</em>). The
                    oldest known Martian meteorites, which date to roughly 4.4
                    billion years ago, therefore present an "amazing chance to
                    study the magnetic field," says Vervelidou, of MIT and the
                    Institute of Earth Physics of Paris.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But such opportunities can be readily squandered, Vervelidou
                    and colleagues have shown. The team's numerical calculations
                    and experiments with earthly rocks — stand-ins for
                    meteorites — confirmed that bringing a hand magnet close to
                    a rock can rearrange the spins of the rock's electrons. That
                    rearrangement overwrites the imprint of a previous magnetic
                    field, a process called remagnetization.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It is possible to evaluate a meteorite without
                    destroying its magnetic properties. Vervelidou uses a lab
                    instrument called a susceptibility meter, which measures how
                    an object would respond to a magnetic field. And portable
                    versions exist: She and a team of meteorite researchers used
                    one to find nearly 1,000 meteorites on a recent expedition
                    in Chile. Hopefully, Vervelidou says, some of those space
                    rocks will shed light on Mars' magnetic past.

                  <p>
                    Ayla Wing's middle school students don't always know what to
                    make of their 26-year-old teacher's hearing aids. The most
                    common response she hears: "Oh, my grandma has them, too."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But grandma's hearing aids were never like this:
                    Bluetooth-enabled and connected to her phone, they allow Ms.
                    Wing to toggle with one touch between custom settings. She
                    can shut out the world during a screeching subway ride, hear
                    her friends in noisy bars during a night out and even
                    understand her students better by switching to "mumbly
                    kids."

                  <p>
                    A raft of new hearing aids have hit the market in recent
                    years, offering greater appeal to a generation of young
                    adults that some experts say is both

                    and — perhaps paradoxically — becoming more comfortable with
                    an expensive piece of technology pumping sound into their
                    ears.

                    Some of the new models, including Ms. Wing's, are made by
                    traditional prescription brands, which usually require a
                    visit to a specialist. But the Food and Drug Administration
                    opened up the market last year when it allowed the sale of
                    hearing aids over the counter. In response, brand names like
                    Sony and Jabra began releasing their own products, adding to
                    the new wave of designs and features that appeal to young
                    consumers.

                  <p>
                    "These new hearing aids are sexy," said Pete Bilzerian, a
                    25-year-old in Richmond, Va., who has worn the devices since
                    he was 7. He describes his early models as distinctly
                    unsexy: "big, funky, tan-colored hearing aids with the
                    molding that goes all around the ear." But increasingly,
                    those have given way to sleeker, smaller models with more
                    technological capabilities.

                  <p>
                    Nowadays, he said, no one seems to notice the electronics in
                    his ear. "If it ever does come up as a topic, I just brush
                    it off and say, 'Hey, I got these very expensive AirPods.'"

                    The CNIL data protection commission told
                    <em>The Connexion</em> there was no specific legislation
                    relating to them but it "strongly advised" that people did
                    not use them. "While we are waiting for government or
                    parliament to come up with laws governing their use, we are
                    vigilant on the question and have carried out legal
                    exercises within the CNIL considering various scenarios," it

                    device which records, even partially, public spaces."

                    [...] "If you are in an accident where another driver is at
                    fault, to be strictly within the law you have to tell them
                    straight away that you have a camera and the incident was
                    filmed," he said.

                    quickly as you can, and also to the police if they are
                    involved, because if you wait, the presumption is that you
                    have manipulated the images.

                  <p>
                    "Obviously, the best way of doing that is through your
                    lawyer or insurance company, but you have to be quick about
                    it, and it is not always easy to get personal details so you

                    to be used if you think that you might be at fault.

                    may or may not help your case with the insurance company,
                    the courts also have the right to use the images gathered as
                    evidence against you, if they are presented to them by the

                    Gallup has tracked several swings in public opinion since
                    first asking about nuclear in 1994. From 2004 to 2015, a
                    majority of Americans favored nuclear power use, with a high
                    of 62 percent in support in 2010. But in 2016, the survey
                    found a majority opposition to nuclear power for the first
                    time. Gallup speculated that lower gasoline prices that year
                    may have "lessened Americans' perceptions that energy
                    sources such as nuclear power are needed." In recent years,
                    views on nuclear power had been evenly divided until the
                    latest poll, conducted between March 1 and 23.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new poll found that 62 percent of Republicans support
                    the use of nuclear power, compared to 46 percent of
                    Democrats. The support from Republicans is likely driven by
                    "a focus on energy independence, supporting innovation,
                    supporting American leadership globally, and supporting
                    American competition with folks like China and Russia
                    specifically in terms of the nuclear space," said Ryan
                    Norman, senior policy advisor at the center-left think tank
                    Third Way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In addition to the Department of Energy's modeling,
                    the International Energy Agency's Net Zero by 2050 scenario
                    found that in order to fully decarbonize the global economy,
                    worldwide nuclear power capacity would need to double
                    between 2022 and 2050.

                    In Congress, nuclear power has enjoyed some rare moments of
                    bipartisan support. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle
                    have joined forces to pass a few successful pro-nuclear
                    laws. The 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law injected $6
                    billion toward maintaining existing nuclear power plants.
                    And while the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act was an entirely
                    Democratic effort, it included a technology-neutral tax
                    credit for low-carbon energy that can be used for nuclear
                    power plants. The climate spending law also allocates
                    millions in investments for advanced nuclear research and
                    demonstration.

                    "Remarkably, the cognitive scores increased to levels
                    similar to undergraduates taking the same cognitive tests
                    for the first time," Wu said. "Our finding of continuous
                    cognitive growth in older adulthood is unique because most
                    studies show only maintenance of cognitive abilities or
                    cognitive decline over time."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The key to the difference, Wu surmises, is learning multiple
                    tasks simultaneously in an encouraging environment, similar
                    to what children experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For Wu, it is further affirmation of her past
                    research, which demonstrated that older adults can learn by
                    emulating the learning behaviors of children. Among other
                    things, it means older adults must approach learning with an
                    open mind, unafraid of criticism and failure, receptive to
                    instruction, willing to learn multiple tasks at once, and
                    with a belief they can improve with effort.

                    More than 40 leading scientists have resigned en masse from
                    the editorial board of a top science journal in protest at
                    what they describe as the "greed" of publishing giant

                    <em>Neuroimage</em>, the leading publication globally for
                    brain-imaging research, is one of many journals that are now
                    "open access" rather than sitting behind a subscription
                    paywall. But its charges to authors reflect its prestige,
                    and academics now pay over £2,700 for a research paper to be
                    published. The former editors say this is "unethical" and
                    bears no relation to the costs involved.

                    [...] Remember: Speed of light × elapsed time = distance.
                    Now they have a radius for how far away my server is. By
                    doing the same test over and over and from a wide range of
                    sources, all of the distances begin to overlap (triangulate)
                    in a specific location. At the rate they are scanning, they
                    have probably located my server to within a 25 mile (40km)
                    radius.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But why stop there? They are using a wide range of sources
                    and are querying every pingable server. They can use these
                    known locations to help fine-tune the geolocation for lots
                    of other subnets. This is how you geolocate every network on
                    the entire internet.

                    [...] Stopping pings does block this group from doing
                    geolocation. However, I want ping enabled for my honeypots.
                    For those systems, I came up with another creative solution:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>

                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    (You might need to install niceshaper: sudo apt install
                    niceshaper.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The "tc" program does traffic control. Usually
                    administrators use it to throttle the throughput so that one
                    host doesn't dominate all of the building's bandwidth.
                    However on my honeypot, I just added in a random delay of
                    100 +/- 50ms. Suddenly those measured delays and computed
                    distances are unreliable. Things that should be 1,800 miles
                    away can now appear to be over 100,000 miles away. (That
                    computed example of 69,000 miles was due to this random
                    delay.) This doesn't stop them from pinging my server, but
                    it does poison their geolocation computations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I haven't yet figured out how to only add delays to ICMP and
                    ICMPv6 echo-request packets. But this solution is definitely
                    good enough for now. Nothing stops them from slinging their
                    echo-request packets all over the internet. However, my
                    production servers don't respond and my honeypots mess them
                    up.

                    group of four Mn atoms and one Ca atom acts like a battery
                    that gets more and more charged with each step," they told
                    us. After four photons have been absorbed, Photosystem II
                    strips protons from water molecules and brings them close
                    enough that a new chemical bond is forged between the oxygen

                      >accidentally leaked to ChatGPT</a
                    >, Samsung is cracking down on usage of the generative AI
                    service. The electronics giant is planning a temporary block
                    of the use of generative AI tools on company-owned devices,
                    covering computers, tablets, phones, as well as
                    non-company-owned devices running on internal networks. The
                    ban would cover not just ChatGPT, but services that use the
                    technology like Microsoft's Bing, as well as competing
                    generative AI services like Bard from Google.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to a memo from Monday seen by Bloomberg, the
                    restriction would be temporary, lasting until it builds
                    "security measures to create a secure environment for safely
                    using generative AI to enhance employees' productivity and
                    efficiency." The South Korea-headquartered tech firm is said
                    to be developing its own in-house AI tools for "software
                    development and translation," according to the report.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The tech giant initially allowed employees at its
                    device solutions (DS) division, which manages its
                    semiconductor and display businesses, to use generative AI
                    from March 11. In the aftermath of the data leak, Samsung
                    also asked staff using generative AI tools elsewhere "not to
                    submit any company-related information or personal data,"
                    which could disclose its intellectual property, by the memo
                    reviewed by Bloomberg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the issues that Samsung noted that it is difficult to
                    "retrieve and delete" the data on external servers, and the
                    data transmitted to such AI tools could be disclosed to
                    other users. Based on Samsung's internal survey in April,
                    about 65% of participants said using generative AI tools
                    carries a security risk.

                    Ransomware attacks against companies and government agencies
                    are on the rise despite efforts by cybersecurity experts to
                    prevent such incidences. Since the start of the pandemic,
                    hundreds of U.S. businesses have reported being ransomware
                    victims, with the largest known attack being the Kaseya hack
                    in 2021.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More recently, the U.S. government has also faced a string
                    of cybersecurity incidents, with the FBI, the Department of
                    Defense, and the United States Marshals Service (USMS) all
                    confirming multiple data leaks and targeted attacks this
                    year. Just last week, the USMS
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techspot.com/news/97764-us-marshals-service-latest-string-cybersecurity-incidents-over.html"
                      >announced</a
                    >
                    that cybercriminals had targeted its systems with a
                    ransomware attack, exposing a large amount of data,
                    including personally identifiable information (PII) of
                    employees. Thankfully, the incident did not expose the
                    witness protection program database, meaning no witnesses
                    are in danger.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to
                    <a
                      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/05/01/marshals-hack-fugitives-surveillance-shutdown/"
                      >The Washington Post</a
                    >, the system has remained down for so long because the USMS
                    decided not to pay any ransom to unlock the network.
                    Instead, officials moved to shut down the entire system,
                    which included remotely wiping the cellphones of all
                    employees who worked in the department. The sudden move,
                    which was implemented without any prior warning, cleared out
                    all their files, contacts and emails, inconveniencing many.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, despite the apparent roadblock, the USMS remains
                    adamant that the shutdown isn't affecting its ability to
                    conduct investigations. In a statement this week, Marshals
                    spokesperson Drew Wade said that most of the critical
                    investigative tools have already been restored, and the
                    agency is planning to soon deploy "a fully reconstituted
                    system with improved IT security countermeasures" for the
                    future.

                    [...] Nanoplastics are defined as having a size of less than
                    0.001 millimetres, while at 0.001 to 5 millimetres, some
                    microplastics are still visible to the naked eye. MNPs enter
                    the food chain through various sources including packaging
                    waste. But it is not just solid food that plays a role, but
                    liquids too: according to one study, anyone who drinks the
                    recommended 1.5-2 litres of water per day from plastic
                    bottles will end up ingesting around 90,000 plastic
                    particles a year in the process. However, drinking tap water
                    instead can – depending on the geographical location – help
                    reduce this figure to 40,000. "To minimise the potential
                    harm of micro- and nanoplastic particles to humans and the
                    environment, it is crucial to limit exposure and restrict
                    their use while further research is carried out into the
                    effects of MNPs," Lukas Kenner explained. The newly
                    discovered mechanism by which MNPs breach protective
                    barriers in the body has the potential to advance research
                    in this area decisively.

                    Although the 15 billion gallons of ethanol mixed into
                    gasoline each year falls well short of the 36 billion that
                    President Bush hoped for, the number of refineries in the
                    U.S. has nearly doubled to almost 200 since his presidency.
                    Between 2008 and 2016, corn cultivation increased by about 9
                    percent. In some areas, like the Dakotas and western
                    Minnesota, it rose as much as 100 percent during that time.
                    Nationwide, corn land expanded by more than 11 million acres
                    between 2005 and 2021.

                    "A quarter of all the corn land in the U.S. is used for
                    ethanol. It's a land area equivalent to all the corn land in
                    Minnesota and Iowa combined," said Hill. "That has
                    implications. It's not just what happens in the U.S. It's
                    what happens globally."

                    reduction. However, Samsung doesn't compare its SF3 to SF3E,
                    and there is no word about the SRAM and analog circuit
                    scaling.

                  <p>
                    One of the main benefits of GAA transistors over FinFET
                    devices is the reduced leakage current since their gate is
                    surrounded by the channel on all four sides. Additionally,
                    the channel thickness can be adjusted to enhance performance
                    or reduce power consumption.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Samsung now says that the SF3 platform offers greater design
                    flexibility enabled by various nanosheet (NS) widths of the
                    MBCFET device within the same cell type. It is unclear
                    whether it means that the original SF3E lacks one of the key
                    capabilities of GAA transistors, but Samsung's phrasing at
                    least implies it.

                    in its paper depicts damage on top of the nanosheet during
                    the metal gate process, so we may speculate that one of the
                    aspects that the company will cover are production
                    challenges it encountered with its GAA-based SF3E production
                    node.

                    Interestingly, recently the company admitted that its
                    fabrication processes are behind those of TSMC, and it will
                    take at least five years to catch up.

                    A 48-year-old woman survived five days stranded in the bush
                    in Australia by eating sweets and drinking a single bottle
                    of wine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lillian Ip set off on what was meant to be a short trip on
                    Sunday, travelling through dense bush in Victoria state.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But she hit a dead-end after taking a wrong turn, and her
                    vehicle became stuck in the mud.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ms Ip - who doesn't drink - only had a bottle of wine in the
                    car as she was planning to give it as a present.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After five nights stranded, she was discovered by emergency
                    services on Friday as they flew overhead as part of a
                    search.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The first thing coming in my mind, I was thinking 'water
                    and a cigarette,'" Ms Ip told 9News Australia. "Thank god
                    the policewoman had a cigarette."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The only liquid Lillian, who doesn't drink, had with
                    her was a bottle of wine she had bought as a gift for her
                    mother so that got her through," Wodonga Police Station
                    Sergeant Martin Torpey said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "She used great common sense to stay with her car and not
                    wander off into bushland, which assisted in police being
                    able to find her."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ms Ip was taken to hospital to be treated for dehydration,
                    but has since returned home to Melbourne.

                    It could be a crucial question posed by the expected growth
                    in space tourism over the next decade – namely what would a
                    human conception in space mean for the sector?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's the situation posed by an international group of
                    scientists, clinicians and other interested parties, who
                    have authored a consultative green paper led by

                  <p>
                    It highlights that the emerging space tourism sector has not
                    openly considered or discussed the risks of sex in space or
                    prepared suitable mitigation approaches. It argues it is
                    unrealistic to assume all future space tourists will abstain
                    from sexual activities – opening the possibility of human
                    conception and the early stages of human reproduction
                    occurring in space.

                  <p>
                    This appears to pose several risks, those of a biological
                    nature such as embryo developmental risks and those of a
                    commercial nature such as liability, litigation, and
                    reputational damage. The authors recommend that an open
                    discussion is now needed within the space tourism industry
                    to consider the risks.

                    The software, NeMo Guardrails, is supposed to ensure that
                    smart applications, such as AI chatbots, powered by large
                    language models (LLMs) are "accurate, appropriate, on topic
                    and secure," according to Nvidia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The open-source software can be used by AI developers can
                    utilize to set up three types of boundaries for AI models:
                    Topical, safety, and security guardrails.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The safety guardrails are an attempt to tackle the
                    issue of misinformation and hallucinations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When employed, it will ensure that AI applications respond
                    with accurate and appropriate information. For example, by
                    using the software, bans on inappropriate language and
                    credible source citations can be reinforced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Nvidia claims that virtually all software developers
                    will be able to use NeMo Guardrails since they are simple to
                    use, work with a broad range of LLM-enabled applications,
                    and work with all the tools that enterprise app developers
                    use such as LangChain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company will be incorporating NeMo Guardrails into its
                    Nvidia NeMo framework, which is already mostly available as
                    an open-source code on GitHub.

                    5G networks are continuing to deliver better and faster

                    have generally declined around the world, according to

                    Part of the problem is the same problem had by every
                    cellular generation. There are the normal growing pains as
                    more customers buy new phones and other devices that can tap
                    into these networks. [...]

                    [...] Outside of cities, different problems are taking root.
                    A big selling-point for 5G is the ability to tap into new
                    bands of spectrum, most notably the

                    Millimeter wave has also seen barely any uptake outside of a
                    handful of countries, including the United States, and even
                    there it's been limited. Companies like Verizon—initially
                    bullish on millimeter wave—have instead pivoted to other
                    newly-available bands, most notably the C-band (4 to 8 GHz).

                    [...] It's too early to say whether or how 6G development
                    will be impacted by 5G's early stumbles, but there are a
                    handful of possible impacts. It's conceivable, for example,
                    given the lackluster debut of millimeter wave, that the
                    industry devotes less time in terahertz wave research and
                    instead considers how cellular and Wi-Fi technologies could
                    be merged in areas requiring dense coverage.

                    Data science technologies available to today's researchers
                    play a key role in shaping our understanding of the solar
                    system. It not only uncovers new findings from the latest
                    data, it also allows researchers to glean new information
                    from previously collected data. Thanks to this tech,
                    researchers reviewing decades-old data from NASA's Voyager 2
                    probe have uncovered exciting secrets locked below the
                    surface of Uranus' moons.

                    spacecraft was launched in 1977 to study our solar system's
                    outer planets and beyond. In 1986, the probe became the
                    first of its kind to visit Uranus, returning never before
                    seen images and data about the ice giant during its
                    five-and-a-half-hour fly-by on the way to Neptune. During
                    the trip, the probe discovered and provided data about 10
                    new moons orbiting the planet, two new rings (in addition to
                    nine previously known rings), and information about Uranus'
                    tilted, off-axis magnetic field.

                  <p>
                    Despite the data being more than 37 years old, researchers
                    analyzing it using modern modeling techniques have made
                    significant discoveries on four of Uranus' largest moons.
                    Based on the

                    >, four of the planet's 27 moons (Titania, Oberon, Ariel,
                    and Umbriel) appear to have an ocean layer between their
                    cores and the icy surface that covers them.

                    The study incorporated the original data gathered during
                    Voyager 2's fly-bys with more recent data from ground-based
                    stations and other NASA spacecraft, including Galileo,
                    Cassini, Dawn, and New Horizons. The augmented Voyager 2
                    data models allowed researchers to determine that the moons
                    may generate enough internal heat to maintain a liquid
                    ocean, possibly even some with habitable temperatures.

                    Users are compelled to choose a common handle to avoid
                    chances of being impersonated
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This raises a lot of obvious fears and thorny questions.
                    Depending on who gets to set their usernames first, is there
                    anything stopping people from taking over a particularly
                    popular creator's distinctive name? Should Discord prevent
                    this by holding usernames for well-known creators, even if
                    they're not first in line? This is a problem for a lot of
                    social networks, but unlike with some fledgling service
                    attracting new users, all these people are already on
                    Discord — in some cases, they're probably even paid
                    subscribers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, Discord said it would
                    be trying to navigate the change gracefully for its
                    best-known users. "We created processes for high-visibility
                    users to secure usernames that will allow them to operate on
                    our platform with minimal risk of impersonation," said
                    Kellyn Slone, director of product communications. "Users
                    with a standing business relationship with Discord who
                    manage certain partner, verified, or creator servers will be
                    able to pick a username before other users in order to
                    reduce the risk of impersonation for their accounts."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A lot of Discord users will fall outside those boundaries.
                    "As a content creator who has a relatively large fanbase —
                    my handle is subject to username sniping by someone with an
                    older account than me," artist
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/zestylemonss">ZestyLemons</a>,
                    who uses Discord to connect with fans, writes to
                    <em>The Verge</em>. "I am not a Discord partner, nor am I
                    famous enough to obtain their recognition, so I will
                    absolutely not have security with my public handle."
                    ZestyLemons noted that for people who <em>do</em> get
                    desirable names, there's the risk of being

                    to give it up — something that's happened on Instagram and
                    Twitter.

                  <p>
                    Discord users understand right now that there are a lot of
                    accounts with very similar names, distinguished only by
                    random numbers at the end. But absolute names change that
                    understanding. They encourage people to look for believable
                    usernames — if somebody nabs the one and only @verge (our
                    Twitter handle) on Discord, people could be more inclined to
                    believe it's us.

                  <p>
                    "It's a bummer that Discord's giving in to the usual social
                    media norms."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Despite fears about individual users impersonating
                    each other, the risks for server moderation are less clear —
                    and some Discord server admins told <em>The Verge</em> they
                    weren't worried. "I don't think the change will be a big
                    deal for admins + mods," says Emily, an admin for a large
                    <em>Pokémon Go</em> meet group on Discord. The server
                    already asks people to set server-specific nicknames that
                    match their <em>Pokémon Go</em> trainer name, so they're not
                    relying on discriminators to tell people apart.

                    >
                    who also runs a small Discord server, agrees. "The current
                    username and discriminator system worked perfectly fine, and
                    allowed for thousands of people to have the same name on the
                    platform overall," SupaIsaiah016 writes to
                    <em>The Verge</em>. "Sites that use handles and display
                    names such as Twitter have very different reasons as to why
                    they use those systems, as they are public social medias."

                    It's easy to build your own desktop PC but, if you want a
                    phone, you usually have to settle for a sealed box that's
                    made by one of a handful of large corporations. Maker Evan
                    Robison wants to change all that as he posted instructions
                    for an open-source,

                    with the acronym OURS standing for Open-source, Upgradable,
                    Repairable Smartphone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Robinson, the idea was to create a smartphone
                    alternative for people looking to control their privacy. He
                    also wanted to make a smartphone that could be easily
                    modified and repaired, so an open-source solution was the
                    perfect fit. The OURphone project has quite a few specs that
                    you'll find on many smartphones including 4G LTE internet
                    support, GPS support, Bluetooth and WiFi capability, as well
                    as basic phone operations like the ability to call, text and
                    save contacts in an address book.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, instead of running on Android or iOS, the phone

                    In his build guide, Robinson is using a Raspberry Pi 3 B+
                    but there's no reason you couldn't upgrade it to a Pi 4.
                    It's accompanied by a 4G HAT with GSM and GPS antennas. It
                    has a Waveshare touchscreen for video output and user input.
                    A camera can be attached but it isn't necessary for the
                    build. A pair of headphones with a built-in microphone is
                    used for call support. To keep the unit mobile, it operates
                    off of a couple of 18650 batteries.

                    to be had. Bubble problems make sense in any dimension, and
                    Sullivan found that as long as the number of volumes you're
                    trying to enclose is at most one greater than the dimension,
                    there's a particular way to enclose the volumes that is, in
                    a certain sense, more beautiful than any other—a sort of
                    shadow of a perfectly symmetric bubble cluster on a sphere.
                    This shadow cluster, he conjectured, should be the one that
                    minimizes surface area.

                  <p>
                    Over the decade that followed, mathematicians wrote a series
                    of groundbreaking papers proving Sullivan's conjecture when
                    you're trying to enclose only two volumes. Here, the
                    solution is the familiar double bubble you may have blown in
                    the park on a sunny day, made of two spherical pieces with a
                    flat or spherical wall between them (depending on whether
                    the two bubbles have the same or different volumes).

                    Now, mathematicians have been spared that long wait—and have
                    gotten far more than just a solution to the triple bubble
                    problem. In a
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09102">paper</a> posted
                    online in May 2022, Milman and
                    <a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/jneeman/"
                      >Joe Neeman</a
                    >, of the University of Texas, Austin, have proved
                    Sullivan's conjecture for triple bubbles in dimensions three
                    and up and quadruple bubbles in dimensions four and up, with
                    a follow-up paper on quintuple bubbles in dimensions five
                    and up in the works.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And when it comes to six or more bubbles, Milman and Neeman
                    have shown that the best cluster must have many of the key
                    attributes of Sullivan's candidate, potentially starting
                    mathematicians on the road to proving the conjecture for
                    these cases too. "My impression is that they have grasped
                    the essential structure behind the Sullivan conjecture,"
                    said

                    shows that, just like humans, monkeys are capable of complex
                    deliberation and careful decision-making. The study is first
                    to show that monkeys can think deeply about a problem and
                    consider combinations of factors such as costs, consequences
                    and constraints. In doing so, monkeys find optimal outcomes
                    rather than impulsively reaching for the first available
                    option.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Humans are not the only animals capable of slow and
                    thoughtful deliberation," said senior author William
                    Stauffer, Ph.D., assistant professor of neurobiology at the
                    <a href="https://www.medschool.pitt.edu/"
                      >University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine</a
                    >. "Our work shows that monkeys have a rich mental state
                    that renders them capable of intelligent thinking. It's a
                    new paradigm for studying the neurophysiological basis for
                    deliberative thought."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Several decades ago, Nobel Prize laureate Daniel
                    Kahneman, Ph.D., revolutionized the field of behavioral
                    economics with Prospect Theory. In his book, "Thinking Fast
                    and Slow," he postulated that humans employ two distinct
                    systems of thinking — one nearly instantaneous that happens
                    automatically, and the other much slower, conscious, logical
                    reasoning that requires more mental effort.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kahneman dubbed the first, effortless, type of thinking as
                    'fast' and the second as 'slow.' Slow, effortful thinking
                    enables us to write music, develop scientific hypothesis and
                    balance our checkbooks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As it turns out, the slow thinking of humans is not unique.

                    has not been identified, justified nor clarified. This
                    'solution' would harm and discriminate against every other
                    part of European business and consumer good, to the single
                    benefit only of large telecom providers."

                    They also raise antitrust concerns, suggesting additional
                    payments made direct to telco incumbents would only crank up
                    the "profitability gap" that already exists between
                    traditional telecom operators vs smaller alternative
                    operators and MVNOs; and vs other content services providers
                    which rely on telcos' networks to provide "vital competition
                    and choice for consumers", as their statement puts it.

                    The prospect of the Commission taking steps to cement Big
                    Telco's grip on connectivity does seems at odds with recent
                    moves by the Commission to regulate Big Tech's market

                    European Commission appeared so captured by special

                    WTF?! Now you can bypass your hard drive and store your
                    whole operating system in your VRAM (should you want to).
                    Well-known Windows modder NTDEV has demonstrated how, and
                    it's surprisingly painless.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Step one is to create a RAM drive in your GPU's memory. A
                    VRAM drive, if you will. There's an open-source tool that
                    can do it for you called
                    <a href="https://github.com/prsyahmi/GpuRamDrive"
                      >GpuRamDrive</a
                    >. It only takes a couple clicks but the tool was abandoned
                    before it reached stability, so you might need to try it a
                    few times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Step two is to use your pick of tools to create a virtual
                    machine. NTDEV used Windows' baked-in Hyper-V manager, which
                    is a simple yet powerful tool for spawning virtual machines
                    available to Windows 10 and 11 Pro, Education, and
                    Enterprise users. You'll need to change just a couple of
                    defaults in Hyper-V, and you can pick those out in NTDEV's
                    video.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you have an RTX 4090 or RX 7900 XTX or a GPU with more
                    than 20 GB of VRAM then you should be able to squeeze a
                    vanilla Windows 11 installation onto the VRAM drive you
                    created. If you didn't drop a grand on a new GPU this past
                    year, you'll have to use an alternate operating system with
                    less demanding storage requirements. NTDEV uses Tiny11, a
                    stripped-down version of Windows 11 that he created.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I can't think of a single reason why anyone would want
                    to run Windows 11 on their VRAM. And yet, it's astonishingly
                    practical: quick to set up and seemingly as fast and stable
                    as a regular virtual machine. Why not, then, I suppose?

                    The best way to get a better look at the cold gas was to
                    view the system in the infrared spectrum, so De turned to
                    observational data from the Palomar Observatory's infrared
                    camera, as well as archival data collected by NASA's

                      >NEOWISE telescope</a
                    >, which images the night sky in the infrared every six
                    months. That data showed that even after the optical light
                    had faded, there was still a strong infrared glow from all
                    that cold dust. Nine months before the brightening, NEOWISE
                    had picked up an infrared glow from dust in the system. And
                    data from the
                    <a
                      href="https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/gemini-observatory/gemini-south/"
                      >Gemini South Telescope</a
                    >
                    provided high-resolution observations enabling De
                    <em>et al</em>. to pinpoint the location of the outburst, as
                    well as measurements of the star's brightness over time,
                    free of contaminating data from nearby stars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All that data gave De three key pieces of evidence: cold gas
                    detected in the outburst, dust formed after the outburst
                    giving off an infrared glow, and an infrared brightening
                    several months before the outburst. De thought it must be
                    the signature of two stars merging, but the event was 100 to
                    1,000 times fainter than any such merger known. So
                    whatever ZTF SLRN-2020 swallowed had to be something a
                    thousand times less massive than the star, based on what is
                    currently known about stellar dynamics. The most likely
                    object was a planet: a gas giant roughly the size of
                    Jupiter.

                    is to answer the questions: Where do we come from? And where

                    Las Vegas city officials have approved The Boring Company's
                    request to expand its planned network of underground
                    tunnels. The Las Vegas Loop will now feature a total of 69
                    stations and 65 miles, or 104 kilometers, of tunnels.
                  </p>

                    The Boring Company tweeted the news yesterday evening,
                    following a meeting with the Clarke County Zoning Commission
                    yesterday morning. The Las Vegas Loop was set to feature a
                    combined 34 miles, or 55 kilometers, of tunnels and had
                    stations that predominantly ran along the Las Vegas Strip.
                    The Boring Company then asked in March to expand the Las
                    Vegas loop, with the newly approved expansion adding 18 new
                    stations and about 25 miles, 40 kilometers, of additional
                    tunnels, according to a tweet from the county's official
                    account yesterday.

                    Attorney Stephanie Allen, representing the Boring Company,
                    told county commissioners at yesterday's meeting that the
                    Las Vegas loop currently has 2.2 miles constructed with 5
                    operational stops—four at the Las Vegas Convention Center
                    and one at Resorts World. Allen further told commissioners
                    that 1 million passengers have ridden through the network so
                    far, with peak ridership in one day reaching over 32,000.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The more opportunities we have on this map, the more
                    opportunities for success with this system," Allen said
                    during the meeting.

                    The French regulator, which has taken a preliminary view
                    that Meta's practices are likely to break competition rules,
                    notes in a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/communiques-de-presse/verification-publicitaire-sur-internet-lautorite-de-la-concurrence-prononce"

                    that Adloox's last request to Meta, in August 2022, went
                    unanswered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The Authority considers that Meta's practices are likely to
                    constitute an abuse of a dominant position," the regulator
                    writes in a statement [translated from French using machine
                    translation]. "In light of the investigation, the Authority
                    considered that Meta is likely to hold a dominant position
                    on the French market for online advertising on social media
                    as well as on the broader market for online advertising not
                    linked to search. Given the importance of the advertising
                    investments made on Meta's platform, Meta is perceived as a
                    key partner for independent auditors."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Practices by Meta that the regulator is calling out as
                    likely to constitute an abuse of a dominant position are 1):
                    The lack of defined and transparent objective,
                    non-discriminatory and proportionate criteria for accessing
                    and maintaining viewability and brand safety partnerships —
                    with the Autorité saying the company integrated its current
                    partners "following an opaque procedure initiated by Meta
                    alone". And while it notes Meta informed it of new
                    eligibility criteria for the partnerships at the start of
                    this year it points out these are still not public, nor do
                    they appear to pass muster in other aspects, with the
                    regulator pointing out they are still intended to be
                    implemented as part of an (i.e. opaque) invitation system
                    and suggesting they seem "both disproportionate and
                    unjustified".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Secondly, the Autorité says Meta's refusal of partnership
                    access to Adloox is likely to be discriminatory, given its
                    assessment that the third party is in an equivalent
                    situation to others that have been granted access by Meta.

                    Working out how exactly to deorbit the station is a mammoth
                    undertaking. Many large objects have burned up in the
                    Earth's atmosphere, most notably <a

                    >. The ISS represents a whole new problem, however, being
                    more than three times the size of Mir. "It is a significant
                    challenge," says Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the
                    Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in the US. "A
                    400-tonne object falling out of the sky is not great."

                    Beginning as the single Russian-built Zarya module in 1998,
                    the station today is enormous, boasting 16 modules, vast
                    solar panels mounted on a metallic truss, and radiators to
                    expel heat. At 109m (356ft) in length it is the size of a
                    football field, the largest human structure ever assembled
                    in space. "It's like the pyramids of Giza," says Laura
                    Forczyk, a space analyst at the US consulting firm
                    Astralytical. A rotating crew of seven inhabit the station

                    about 320km (200 miles) in mid-2030. At this point a final
                    crew will be sent to the station, likely ensuring any
                    remaining equipment or items of historical significance that
                    have yet to be removed are done so, also reducing the weight
                    of the station. "That is still in discussion," says
                    Aschbacher.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once the final crew has left, the station's altitude will
                    drop further to 280km (175 miles), deemed the point of no
                    return – where the station could no longer be boosted back
                    above the drag caused by our planet's thickening atmosphere
                    – a process that will take several months. Here, Russian
                    Progress spacecraft are earmarked to then give the station a
                    final push back into the planet's atmosphere.

                  <p>
                    [...] Whatever spacecraft is used, after this final push,
                    the station will reach an altitude of 120km (75 miles),
                    where it will hit the Earth's thicker atmosphere at some
                    29,000km/h (18,000 mph), beginning re-entry in earnest.
                    First, the solar panels will be torn from the structure.
                    "The headwind will be so much," says McDowell. Based on

                    A recent MIT paper proposes a new method to "grow" 2D
                    transistors on top of wafers, potentially speeding the
                    production of ultrathin computing materials. The study
                    claims to solve the heating and assembly problems of other
                    methods, possibly opening new avenues for semiconductors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Manufacturers like Intel, Samsung, and TSMC continually find
                    ways to make ever-smaller transistors to guarantee ongoing
                    increases in processing power each year. TSMC and Samsung
                    have started 3nm semiconductor production as Intel looks
                    forward to counting transistor size in Angstroms, while talk
                    has also shifted to "2D materials" that are only a few atoms
                    thick.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] One problem with building the 2D material molybdenum
                    disulfide is heat. Growing some of its components requires
                    temperatures over 550 degrees Celsius, but silicon wafer
                    circuits start decaying beyond 400. Normally, manufacturers
                    graft the 2D material onto the wafer after its production,
                    often leading to imperfections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers instead grew the material directly onto the
                    wafer with a new kind of kiln that separates part of the
                    cooking process. A high-temperature zone processes the
                    sulfur, after which it flows into the lower-temperature
                    region where the molybdenum and the wafer are kept below
                    400C. The system leads to more uniform surfaces and faster
                    production.

                    While the prior method could take an entire day to grow a
                    layer, the new technique can grow a layer in under an hour.
                    The improvement could enable growth across larger surfaces,
                    and the researchers plan to explore stacking layers.

                    ''After six months, we found common effects for both
                    interventions. Neuroimaging revealed an increase in grey
                    matter in four brain regions involved in high-level
                    cognitive functioning in all participants, including

                    However, the researchers also found a difference between the
                    two groups. In the pianists, the volume of grey matter
                    remained stable in the right primary auditory cortex - a key
                    region for sound processing, whereas it decreased in the
                    active listening group. ''In addition, a global brain
                    pattern of atrophy was present in all participants.
                    Therefore, we cannot conclude that musical interventions
                    rejuvenate the brain. They only prevent ageing in specific
                    regions,'' says Damien Marie.

                    The US semiconductor industry wants to have its cake and eat
                    it, or rather it wants to have continued access to the huge
                    Chinese market despite Washington's ongoing campaign to
                    limit Beijing's access to advanced chip technology.

                  <p>
                    This latest turn in the chip wars is due to concern among US
                    chipmakers over the rules governing what investments
                    companies will be able to make in China. These need to be
                    clearer, according to the
                    <a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/"
                      >Semiconductor Industry Association</a

                    (SIA), so that the companies know where they stand.

                  <p>
                    The SIA wants clear "guardrails" regarding the rules
                    Washington plans to attach to the subsidies it will dole out
                    as part of the CHIPS Act funding designed to boost
                    semiconductor manufacturing in America.

                    that companies receiving CHIPS Act cash would be forbidden
                    from building advanced technology plants in China for a
                    period of 10 years, and would only be allowed to expand any
                    mature node facilities in China for the purpose of serving
                    the Chinese market.

                      >Bloomberg</a
                    >, SIA president and CEO John Neuffer claimed that China was
                    the semiconductor industry's biggest market: "Our view is
                    that we need to play in that market."

                  <p>
                    The SIA said it just wants "clear rules of the road" so that
                    what the US government deems a national security concern is
                    well defined and the companies are able to take heed and
                    plan ahead accordingly.

                    It isn't just US companies that are unhappy with strings
                    attached to CHIPS Act funding. Semiconductor giant TSMC is
                    said to be seeking up to $15 billion in subsidies to help

                    The 10-year ban on Chinese investments is a bone of
                    contention for Samsung Electronics and SK hynix too.

                Multiple sites have been reporting that former Audi CEO, Rupert
                Stadler, will plead guilty for his role in the 2015 emissions
                scandal where Audi and VW software was modified to evade
                emissions testing. The proprietary software embedded in the cars
                was modified to detect when the cars were being operated in
                testing conditions and modified the vehicle's operation to
                reduce emissions enough to pass the inspection. However, during
                normal operation, they polluted like crazy, up to 40x the NOx
                shown during testing conditions. The plea deal he has been
                offered to him in this trial which started 2020 is expected to
                be a €1.1 million fine and serve a suspended sentence of up to
                two years. Stadler has spent several months in pre-trial
                detention to prevent him from interfering with witnesses
                further.

                The scandal has cost those automakers tens of billions so far.
                There was an initial attempt to blame only low level employees.
                However, as the trial shows there was more to it than that and
                that plans came from the highest levels. Further documents show
                that the emissions software had been in cheat mode for many
                years.

                    be a sign of website security and trustworthiness, will soon
                    be changed with a new icon that doesn't imply that a site is

                    While first introduced to show that a website was using
                    HTTPS encryption to encrypt connections, the lock symbol is
                    no longer needed given that more than 99% of all web pages
                    are now loaded in Google Chrome over HTTPS.

                    These also include websites used as landing pages in
                    phishing attacks or other malicious purposes, designed to
                    take advantage of the lock icon to trick the targets into

                    The latest step in post-quantum cryptography guidance is
                    helping organizations identify where current public-key
                    algorithms will need to be replaced, as the National
                    Institute of Standards and Technology continues its push to
                    fortify U.S. digital networks ahead of the maturity of
                    quantum computing.

                  <p>
                    Current goals outlined in the working draft include helping
                    entities locate where and how public key algorithms are
                    utilized in encryption schemes, developing a strategy to
                    migrate these algorithms to quantum-resilient substitutes
                    and performing interoperability and performance testing.

                  <p>
                    [...] A major theme of the document is to help organizations
                    understand the security architecture in their networks so
                    that they firmly grasp where post-quantum security measures
                    will need to be implemented and where to prioritize
                    modernization. NIST also aims to compile a definitive
                    inventory of software vendors to support post-quantum
                    cryptography migration.

                are there some stories that you think an animated movie would

                Photonic circuits are a very promising technology for neural
                networks because they make it possible to build energy-efficient
                computing units. For years, the
                <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en">Politecnico di Milano</a> has
                been working on developing programmable photonic processors
                integrated on silicon microchips only a few mm2 in size for use
                in the field of data transmission and processing, and now

                    "An artificial neuron, like a biological neuron, must
                    perform very simple mathematical operations, such as
                    addition and multiplication, but in a neural network
                    consisting of many densely interconnected neurons, the
                    energy cost of these operations grows exponentially and
                    quickly becomes prohibitive. Our chip incorporates a
                    photonic accelerator that allows calculations to be carried
                    out very quickly and efficiently, using a programmable grid
                    of silicon interferometers. The calculation time is equal to
                    the transit time of light in a chip a few millimeters in
                    size, so we are talking about less than a billionth of a
                    second (0.1 nanoseconds)," says

                    "The advantages of photonic neural networks have long been
                    known, but one of the missing pieces to fully exploit their
                    potential was network training.. It is like having a
                    powerful calculator, but not knowing how to use it. In this
                    study, we succeeded in implementing training strategies for
                    photonic neurons similar to those used for conventional
                    neural networks. The photonic 'brain' learns quickly and
                    accurately and can achieve precision comparable to that of a
                    conventional neural network, but faster and with
                    considerable energy savings. These are all building blocks
                    for artificial intelligence and quantum applications," adds

                <div>
                  <p>
                    Her parents signed up for a clinical trial of an in-utero
                    surgical treatment to see if doctors could intervene before
                    any of these outcomes materialized. It seems to have worked.
                    The team behind the operation now plans to treat more
                    fetuses in the same way. Other, similar brain conditions
                    might benefit from the same approach. For conditions like
                    these, fetal brain surgery could be the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The baby's condition, known as vein of Galen malformation,
                    was first noticed during a routine ultrasound scan at 30
                    weeks of pregnancy. The condition occurs when a vein
                    connects with an artery in the brain. These two types of
                    vessels have different functions and should be kept
                    separate—arteries ferry high-pressure flows of oxygenated
                    blood from the heart, while thin-walled veins carry
                    low-pressure blood back the other way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the two combine, the high-pressure blood flow from an
                    artery can stretch the thin walls of the vein. "Over time
                    the vein essentially blows up like a balloon," says Darren
                    Orbach, a radiologist at Boston Children's Hospital in
                    Massachusetts, who treats babies born with the condition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The resulting balloon of blood can cause serious problems
                    for a baby. "It's stealing blood from the rest of the
                    circulation," says Mario Ganau, a consultant neurosurgeon at
                    Oxford University Hospitals in the UK, who was not involved
                    in this particular case. Other parts of the brain can end up
                    being starved of oxygenated blood, causing brain damage, and
                    there's a risk of bleeding in the brain. The extra pressure
                    put on the heart to pump blood can lead to heart failure.
                    And other organs can suffer too—especially the lungs and
                    kidneys, says Ganau.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fetuses with the condition are thought to be protected by
                    the placenta to some degree. But that changes from the
                    moment the umbilical cord is clamped at birth. "All of a
                    sudden there's this enormous burden placed right on the
                    newborn heart," says Orbach. "Most babies with this
                    condition will become very sick, very quickly."
