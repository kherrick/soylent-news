                infrastructure projects, from FORTRAN to cURL, but this is the
                first time that it directly supports the Linux desktop.

                This grant acknowledges GNOME a part of critical infrastructure
                and therefore worthy of this public support. Most of the spent
                money will go into improving accessibility, but some points also
                address security and the general software infrastructure.

                  <p>
                    The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is getting
                    tough on website design, insisting that opting out of
                    cookies must be as simple as opting in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At question are advertising cookies, where users should be
                    able to "Accept All" advertising cookies or reject them.
                    Users will still see adverts regardless of their selection,
                    but rejecting advertising cookies means ads must not be
                    tailored to the person browsing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the ICO
                    <a
                      href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/11/commissioner-warns-uk-s-top-websites-to-make-cookie-changes/"

                    >
                    that: "Some websites do not give users fair choices over
                    whether or not to be tracked for personalized advertising."
                    This is despite
                    <a
                      href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/08/ico-and-cma-harmful-online-design-encourages-consumers-to-hand-over-personal-information/"
                      >guidance</a
                    >
                    issued in August regarding harmful designs that can trick
                    users into giving up more personal information than
                    intended.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A few months on, the ICO has upped the ante. It has now
                    given 30 days' notice to companies running many of the UK's
                    most visited sites that they must comply with data
                    protection regulations or face enforcement action.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The ICO calls out cookie consent banners as a clear
                    example of often harmful design. Its guidance says: "A
                    website's cookie banner should make it as easy to reject
                    non-essential cookies as it is to accept them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Users should be able to make an informed choice on whether
                    they want to give consent for their personal information to
                    be used, for example, to profile them for targeted
                    advertising."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Cookie consent remains a hot topic for UK and EU
                    lawmakers alike. The EU, for example, has a relatively clear
                    stance on cookie consent – users should be offered a clear
                    and unambiguous choice: yes or no. The ICO requires a
                    similar approach.
                  </p>

                    Stable Video Diffusion, a new free AI research tool that can
                    turn any still image into a short video—with mixed results.
                    It's an open-weights preview of two AI models that use a
                    technique called image-to-video, and it can run locally on a
                    machine with an Nvidia GPU.

                    Last year, Stability AI made waves with the release of
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/"
                      >Stable Diffusion</a
                    >, an "open weights" image synthesis model that kick started
                    a wave of open image synthesis and inspired a large
                    community of hobbyists that have built off the technology
                    with their own custom fine-tunings. Now Stability wants to
                    do the same with AI video synthesis, although the tech is
                    still in its infancy.<br />[...]<br />In our local testing,
                    a 14-frame generation took about 30 minutes to create on an
                    Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics card, but users can experiment with
                    running the models much faster on the cloud through services

                    Inching forward bumper to bumper on a highway when you're on
                    the way to an appointment, or worse, the airport, is enough
                    to spike anyone's blood pressure (BP). But researchers have
                    found that a BP surge occurs independent of external
                    stressors, and it could be due to the poor air flowing into
                    the car from surrounding traffic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The University of Washington (UW) researchers undertook a
                    randomized crossover trial and were surprised to see that
                    sitting in traffic and breathing unfiltered air was linked
                    to a 4.5 mm Hg surge in blood pressure, which peaked at
                    around 60 minutes of exposure but lingered for up to 24
                    hours following the event.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The body has a complex set of systems to try to keep blood
                    pressure to your brain the same all the time," said lead
                    researcher Joel Kaufman, a physician and professor at UW.
                    "It's a very complex, tightly regulated system, and it
                    appears that somewhere, in one of those mechanisms,
                    traffic-related air pollution interferes with blood
                    pressure."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the study, 16 participants aged 22-45 years were driven
                    as passengers through peak-hour traffic in Seattle for
                    periods across three days, to measure the impact of traffic
                    pollution on blood pressure. For two days, the air flowed
                    into the vehicle normally, to mirror how most of us drive,
                    and on another day the car was fitted with a high efficiency
                    particulate air (HEPA) filter, which blocked 86% of
                    particulate pollution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Blood pressure readings were taken a day before, during and
                    after the drive, with 14 three-minute tests collected.
                    Image-based central retinal arteriolar equivalents (CRAEs)
                    were also measured before and after. Brachial artery
                    diameter and gene expression were also taken.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The mean adjusted systolic blood pressure reading of 4.5 mm
                    Hg higher than baseline is comparable to the effect of a
                    high-sodium diet.

                    The summertime barbecue – an American tradition synonymous
                    with celebrating freedom – may be tainted by a decidedly
                    unfree market. A new Stanford study reveals how meat and
                    dairy industry lobbying has influenced government
                    regulations and funding to stifle competition from
                    alternative meat products with smaller climate and
                    environmental impacts. The analysis, published Aug. 18 in
                    One Earth, compares innovations and policies related to
                    plant-based meat alternatives and lab-grown meat in the U.S.
                    and European Union. Its findings could help ensure
                    legislation, such as the $428 billion U.S. Farm Bill set to
                    expire Sept. 30, levels the food industry playing field.

                    "The lack of policies focused on reducing our reliance on
                    animal-derived products and the lack of sufficient support
                    to alternative technologies to make them competitive are
                    symptomatic of a system still resisting fundamental
                    changes," said study lead author Simona Vallone, an Earth

                    [...] The researchers reviewed major agricultural policies
                    from 2014 to 2020 that supported either the animal food
                    product system or alternative technologies, and compared
                    government spending on both systems. They also looked at
                    related lobbying trends.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found that governments consistently devoted most of
                    their agricultural funding to livestock and feed production
                    systems, avoided highlighting food production sustainability
                    dimensions in nutrition guidelines, and attempted to
                    introduce regulatory hurdles, such as narrow labeling
                    standards, to the commercialization of meat alternatives.
                    Major U.S. meat and dairy companies actively lobbied against
                    environmental issues and regulations to tip the scales in
                    their favor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To ensure a fair marketplace for alternative meat
                    products, policymakers should craft legislation that ensures
                    meat's price reflects its environmental costs, increases
                    research on alternative meat and dairy products, and informs
                    consumers on alternatives to meat via dietary guidelines,
                    according to the researchers.

                A new study shows that there is greater local variation in the
                impact of solar storms on Earth than previously estimated.
                Researchers show that the effects can vary widely even over
                distances as small as 100 kilometers. The findings are published
                in Scientific Reports.
              </p>
              <p>
                Local changes in the magnetic environment have so far remained
                largely unexplored due to the sparse magnetometer array in the
                main observing area. Today, solar storms, or geomagnetic storms,
                are recorded on average by magnetometers spaced about 400 km
                apart.
              </p>
              <p>
                Solar storm effects are caused by fast solar wind streams, which
                cause large electric currents to flow through the ionosphere of
                the Earth's auroral region, but the behavior of these currents
                during storms is still not fully understood. Solar storms also
                appear as auroras.
              </p>
              <p>
                Researchers from the Sodankylä Geophysical Observatory (SGO) and
                the Ionospheric Physics Group at the University of Oulu, Finland
                studied the local magnetic field perturbations in the auroral
                region during space storms using historical data.
              </p>
              <p>
                The new study looked at data from a strong solar storm in
                December 1977 from all 32 stations of the then Scandinavian
                Magnetometer Array (SMA) network in the Nordic countries, which
                is denser than the current network, and largely unexplored.

                    Since antiquity, humans have envisioned various means of
                    time travel into the future or the past. The concept has
                    since become a staple of modern science fiction. In
                    particular, the number of films that make use of time travel
                    has increased significantly over the decades, while the
                    real-world science has evolved right alongside them, moving
                    from simple Newtonian mechanics and general relativity to
                    quantum mechanics and the notion of a multiverse or more
                    exotic alternatives like string theory.<br />[...]<br />This
                    is not meant to be an exhaustive list; rather, we selected
                    films that represented many diverse approaches to time
                    travel across multiple subgenres and decades. We then
                    evaluated each one—grading on a curve—with regard to its
                    overall entertainment value and scientific logic, with the
                    final combined score determining a film's spot on the
                    overall ranking. For the "science" part of our scoring
                    system, we specifically took three factors into account.
                    First and foremost, does the time travel make logical sense?
                    Second, is the physical mechanism of time travel somewhat
                    realistic? And third, does the film use time travel in
                    narratively interesting ways? So a movie like Looper, which
                    makes absolutely no sense if you think about it too hard,
                    gets points for weaving time paradoxes thoroughly into the
                    fabric of the story.

                    TSMC chairman Mark Liu believes Nvidia will become the
                    largest semiconductor firm by the end of the year (via
                    <a
                      href="https://www.trendforce.com/news/2023/11/27/news-tsmc-chairman-notes-global-fragmentation-with-the-rise-of-nvidia-and-fabless-companies/"
                      >Trendforce</a
                    >). Speaking at a lecture held by the Chinese National
                    Association of Industry and Commerce, Liu discussed the
                    future of TSMC in an AI-focused world and stated that Nvidia
                    would develop into the world's largest semiconductor company
                    thanks to AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As for Nvidia's rivals, the company made more revenue
                    than
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-takes-chip-business-revenue-crown-from-tsmc"
                      >Intel, Samsung, and even TSMC</a
                    >, the company that produces the vast majority of Nvidia's
                    chips. Nvidia also beat them all in profit, especially
                    Intel, which lost $8 million, and Samsung, which saw $2.86
                    billion wiped out due to factors like the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/potential-nand-shortage-could-mean-end-of-dirt-cheap-ssds"
                      >NAND flash crisis</a
                    >. That's presumably why Liu believes Nvidia will be the
                    largest of its peers by the end of the year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, there are some caveats to Liu's claims. Although
                    Nvidia did beat out its immediate rivals and made the most
                    money in Q3, that might only have been possible since Intel,
                    Samsung, and TSMC are in a slump. All three companies were
                    doing significantly better in revenue before the start of
                    the year, and they all have posted at least one quarter with
                    more than $20 billion in revenue since 2021. If this turns
                    out to be a temporary dip rather than a permanent
                    development, Nvidia would need to make even more money to
                    keep up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Liu also noted that fabless chip designers like
                    Nvidia, AMD, and Google are expected to grow by 10% in the
                    next five years, while projections for Intel and Samsung
                    (the only chip designers to own their fabs) are at just 4%
                    in the same time frame. Both companies have declined for a
                    year or so, with Intel taking great measures to
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intel-ceo-details-company-s-three-biggest-mistakes"
                      >reform its business</a
                    >. TSMC, of course, stands as a major beneficiary if these
                    projections prove accurate, as most fabless companies who
                    want to make cutting-edge processors go to TSMC.

                    After 151 years, Popular Science will no longer be available
                    to purchase as a magazine. In a statement to The Verge,
                    Cathy Hebert, the communications director for PopSci owner
                    Recurrent Ventures, says the outlet needs to "evolve" beyond
                    its magazine product, which published its first all-digital
                    issue in 2021.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    PopSci, which covers a whole range of stories related to the
                    fields of science, technology, and nature, published its
                    first issue in 1872. Things have changed a lot over the
                    years, with the magazine switching to a quarterly
                    publication schedule in 2018 and doing away with the
                    physical copies altogether after 2020.

                      >back in 2015</a

                    kind of biometric authentication device installed. Sometimes
                    that means a face- or iris-scanning infrared webcam;
                    sometimes it means a fingerprint sensor mounted on the power

                    While these authentication methods are convenient, they
                    aren't totally immune to security exploits. In 2021,
                    researchers were able to fool some Windows Hello IR webcams
                    with infrared images of users' faces. And last week,

                  <p>
                    At around 4.05am Wednesday morning, the Optus network
                    received changes to routing information from an
                    international peering network following a software upgrade.
                    These routing information changes propagated through
                    multiple layers in our network and exceeded preset safety
                    levels on key routers. This resulted in those routers
                    disconnecting from the Optus IP Core network to protect
                    themselves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was later revealed that the source of the routing
                    information was Singtel, the Singapore-based telco that owns
                    Optus. The Optus network connects to Singtel internet
                    exchanges in North America and Asia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Optus later blamed the incident on default settings in its
                    Cisco routers, which couldn't cope with the volume of
                    changes sent by Singtel as they exceeded safety limits.
                    Optus's submission explaining the outage is, however, silent
                    on or why its network accepted such changes without testing
                    their impact on its kit – a common and sensible approach to
                    operating mission-critical infrastructure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The danger Optus's outage posed, and the mass
                    inconvenience, earned Bayer Rosmarin an appearance before a
                    parliamentary committee.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Yet Bayer Rosmarin did not do well in her appearance
                    regarding the outage, revealing that the nation's
                    second-largest telco's disaster recovery regime did not
                    envisage a total network outage. Another admission was that
                    the former CEO's personal DR strategy had evolved to see her
                    carry SIM cards for Australia's two rival mobile networks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Left unanswered is how Singtel poisoned the network in
                    the first place, amid an undercurrent of concern that a
                    foreign carrier – even one from a friend like Singapore –
                    had deep enough access to an Australian network to bring it
                    down.

                    Patients often come into clinics on a grocery list of
                    medications. Common prescriptions include lisinopril 20 mg,
                    amlodipine 2.5 mg, metformin 500 mg, and aspirin 81 mg. One
                    dosage stands out from the others. While most medications
                    come in dosages of round numbers or common decimals,
                    low-dose aspirin has a standard dose of 81 mg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Why is aspirin available at a dose of 81 milligrams? The
                    answer is historical in nature and is rooted in a medieval
                    and now defunct system of measurement called the apothecary
                    system of weights and measures. The full explanation of
                    aspirin 81 requires some background information on the
                    apothecary system and is best explained in comparison to the
                    more familiar metric system.

                    Burning coal to generate electricity is on the way out in
                    the United States, but the nation's long dependence on the
                    fossil fuel took a devastating toll.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A new study determined for the first time that soot
                    pollution from coal-fired power plants is more dangerous
                    than soot from other sources. During the past two decades,
                    the researchers found, coal plant soot contributed to the
                    deaths of at least 460,000 Americans, including 25% of all
                    deaths among Medicare recipients before 2009.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Only Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio recorded more deaths
                    associated with coal plant pollution than the 25,000 deaths
                    in Illinois during the period studied.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An interactive map accompanying the study, published in the
                    journal Science, reveals glimmers of hope amid the grim
                    statistics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Deaths attributed to coal plant soot have declined
                    dramatically in recent years as utilities closed scores of
                    their dirtiest plants and cleaned up others—changes prompted
                    by more stringent federal clean air regulations, competition
                    from less expensive gas-fired power plants and legal
                    pressure from environmental groups.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The fact that they estimated more than 40,000 deaths a year
                    two decades ago and the number is now down to 1,600 a year
                    is a pretty remarkable success story," said Jonathan Levy,
                    chair of the Department of Environmental Health at Boston
                    University, who wasn't involved in the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Soot, also known as particulate matter, is a byproduct of
                    incomplete combustion and can be formed by chemical
                    reactions between sulfur dioxide emitted by fossil fuel
                    power plants and other compounds in the atmosphere. The type
                    of soot that most concerns public health
                    researchers—PM2.5—is so tiny that thousands of the fine
                    particles could fit on the period at the end of this
                    sentence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Breathing even small amounts can inflame the lungs and
                    trigger asthma attacks. Previous studies have linked soot
                    exposure with heart attacks and premature death.

                    developed and modify it to work in regular ballpoint pens

                    Instead of a handy "alternate route," Google Maps was
                    leading her and her two passengers "far off the major
                    highway and into Nevada's fierce deserts on an off-roading
                    trail." Easler's car were not the only bushwackers. In

                    driver that turned around talked to us to tell us that the
                    road gets washed out the higher into the mountain you get,
                    and we have to turn around since the path leads nowhere. He
                    was in a huge truck and was just driving straight through
                    the bushes and shrubs to let people know to turn around,"
                    Easler said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The off-roading trail was apparently only wide enough for
                    traffic in one direction, and attempting to return in that
                    other direction, "We were driving over bushes and rocks and
                    alot of the cars couldn't even make it," Easler says in the
                    second video. "Which is kind of why our car broke down."

                    They told SFGate that ultimately "We had to leave the car in
                    Vegas, and it got towed to the service center of a
                    dealership. They said the rear, right tire was coming off,
                    and the alignment was messed up too. Low-key a pretty
                    expensive fix."

                  <p>
                    They eventually called the highway patrol to shut down the
                    road that Google Maps was sending people to, because "With
                    every car coming in, every single car was getting trapped."

                    An estimated 50,000 shipwrecks can be found around the UK's
                    coastline and have been acting as a hidden refuge for fish,
                    corals and other marine species in areas still open to
                    destructive bottom towed fishing, a new study has shown.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of these wrecks have been lying on the seabed for well
                    over a century, and have served as a deterrent to fishers
                    who use bottom towed trawling to secure their catches.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result, while many areas of the seabed have been
                    damaged significantly in areas of heavy fishing pressure,
                    the seabed in and around shipwrecks remains largely
                    unblemished.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Jenny Hickman, the study's lead author, completed the
                    research as part of her MSc Marine Conservation program at
                    the University of Plymouth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She said, "The industrial use of bottom towed fishing gear
                    has been commonplace since the 1800s, and has significantly
                    altered marine communities and ecosystem services. Outside
                    of legal protection, only areas inaccessible to trawlers are
                    offered any protection, which is why shipwreck sites are
                    rarely subject to trawling pressure. As many have been in
                    situ for more than 100 years, they offer a baseline of
                    ecological potential when trawling pressure is reduced or
                    removed."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Joe Richards, Scotland Project Manager for Blue Marine
                    Foundation and one of the study's co-authors, said, "It has
                    long been thought that shipwrecks could be playing an
                    important role in providing sanctuary for marine species to
                    utilize. It is brilliant to see this proven in this study.
                    The research provides and insight into what might be
                    possible if bottom towed fishing activity is reduced. This
                    feeds into our wider understanding of shipwrecks' potential
                    to contribute to ecosystem recovery and enhancement, given
                    the sheer number found on the seabed."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Researchers say the latest study demonstrates the
                    importance of factoring wreck sites into future conservation
                    plans, but also the benefits of Marine Protected Areas
                    (MPAs) status.

                    Scott's ruling is considered a big blow to Tesla, which had
                    denied liability for Banner's death, arguing that human
                    error is at fault because "its manual and the 'clickwrap'
                    agreement sufficiently warned" Tesla owners of Autopilot's
                    limitations.

                    [...] Despite being called the "de facto leader" of the
                    Autopilot team in internal Tesla emails, Musk did not
                    provide a deposition in Banner's case, which was one of the
                    first times Tesla had to defend itself against claims that
                    Autopilot was fatally flawed,

                      >Reuters reported</a
                    >. In August, Tesla also seemingly attempted to do damage
                    control by seeking to "keep deposition transcripts of its
                    employees and other documents secret," Reuters noted.

                    [...] According to an expert in autonomous systems in
                    vehicles and driver monitoring systems who testified as one
                    of Banner's witnesses, Mary "Missy" Cummings, Tesla's
                    Autopilot is substandard in many ways. Cumming's opinion was
                    that Tesla overrepresented the Autopilot technology "as far
                    more capable than it actually was" and "used insufficient
                    avoidance detection technology." Cummings also suggested
                    that "the steering wheel torque driver inattention
                    attenuation technology was substandard to driver facing
                    cameras used by other auto manufacturers." In addition to
                    other flaws, these allegedly major defects, Cummings said,
                    "led to the foreseeability of the resulting crash in this
                    case," Scott wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scott based part of his opinion specifically on Cummings'
                    testimony and testimony from Adam Gustafsson, the systems
                    engineer who investigated both Banner's and Brown's Tesla
                    crashes, concluding that, "There is reasonable evidence from
                    which the finder of fact could conclude that Tesla through
                    its officers, employees and agents knew the vehicle at issue
                    had a defective Autopilot system and allowed the vehicle
                    with the system to be driven in areas not safe for that
                    technology."

                    "As a result of this in-depth investigation, the commission
                    reached the preliminary conclusion that the transaction may
                    significantly reduce competition in the global markets," the

                    [...] By erasing Figma as a competitive hurdle, Adobe would
                    also tighten its grip on the supply of vector and raster
                    editing tools, the EC added.

                  <p>
                    "Figma already exerts a significant constraining influence
                    on Adobe's vector editing tool, Adobe Illustrator, as well
                    as on Adobe's raster editing tool, Photoshop. Moreover,
                    absent the transaction, Figma is significantly likely to
                    enter these markets and grow into an effective competitive
                    force," it said.

                    [...] Adobe had wanted to get the deal done by the close of
                    this calendar year but that is now definitely not going to
                    be the case, with the case files to be publicly updated in

                  <p>
                    In October, Adobe told us of the CMA investigation: "We
                    remain confident in the merits of the case as Figma's
                    product design is an adjacency to Adobe's core creative
                    products and Adobe has no meaningful plans to compete in the
                    product design space.”

                  <p>
                    [...] “The combination of Adobe and Figma will deliver
                    significant value to customers by making product design more
                    accessible and efficient, reimagining creative capabilities
                    on the web and creating new categories of creativity and
                    productivity.

                  <p>
                    "We remain confident in the merits of our case, as Figma’s

                    One summer morning, Le Thi Hong Mai's home collapsed into a
                    river in Vietnam's Mekong Delta, where shoreline erosion
                    caused by sand mining and hydropower dams threatens hundreds
                    of thousands of people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sand—needed to produce concrete—is the world's second most
                    exploited natural resource after water, and its use has
                    tripled in the last two decades, according to the UN
                    environment program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Vietnam's "rice bowl" delta region, where the Mekong empties
                    into the South China Sea, is predicted to run out of sand in
                    just over a decade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But losses to the riverbed are already devastating lives and
                    harming the local economy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Over the past two decades, hydropower dams upstream on
                    the Mekong have restricted the flow of sand to the delta.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And sand mining to feed Vietnam's construction boom is also
                    fast depleting resources, according to a major WWF report
                    published earlier this year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to Vietnam's ministry of transport, the
                    Delta region needs 54 million cubic meters of sand for six
                    major national highways before 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The river system can provide less than half, the ministry
                    says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Vietnam banned exports of sand in all forms in 2017.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But given high domestic demand, the amount dredged still
                    exceeds what comes downstream, Mekong expert Nguyen Huu
                    Thien explained.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the current extraction rate of 35-55 million cubic meters
                    a year, there will be no more sand by 2035, according to the
                    WWF-led study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These are the last grains of sand we are dredging," Thien
                    warned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Half the delta could be gone by the end of the
                    century, Thein warned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "After that, the delta will disappear altogether and we will
                    have to redraw our map and rewrite our geography books."

                    Because it's going to Mars, ESCAPADE has a relatively narrow
                    window to get off the ground next year. Documents on the
                    mission presented at public meetings earlier this year
                    indicated it had a launch window in August 2024, but Smith
                    said Monday that the mission is now set to fly "around this
                    time next year."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But there's not just the risk of a failed launch.
                    Given Blue Origin's history of delays, it's fair to question
                    whether New Glenn will really be ready to fly in a year's
                    time. The company's launch pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force
                    Station in Florida is complete, and production of rocket
                    parts is underway at Blue Origin factory a few miles away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Blue Origin hasn't rolled a full-scale New Glenn rocket
                    out to the launch pad for testing, including propellant
                    loading and countdown rehearsals. These first-time launch
                    pad tests have run for several months to more than a year
                    for other rockets, such as SpaceX's Starship, ULA's Vulcan,
                    or Europe's Ariane 6.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There's certainly some schedule risk associated with New
                    Glenn getting to the pad a year from now," Smith said.
                    "They're building hardware ... I've seen their schedule. I'm
                    not going to put a percentage out there."

                    filed by Moniruzzaman’s old employer, automotive technology
                    company Valeo, which is suing Nvidia — the company
                    Moniruzzaman moved on to — and accusing it of having
                    benefited from these stolen trade secrets.

                    Nvidia has spent the better part of a decade attempting to
                    branch out into the automotive market. Valeo is alleging
                    that Moniruzzaman “downloaded without authorization the
                    entirety of Valeo’s advanced parking and driving assistance
                    systems source code” in early 2021, along with “scores of
                    Valeo Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, PDF files,
                    and Excel spreadsheets explaining various aspects of the
                    technology” before leaving to join Nvidia in August that
                    year. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This alleged theft came to light in March the following
                    year, when employees from both Nvidia and Valeo were on a
                    call together working on a joint parking assistance project
                    for an unnamed automotive parts maker. Nvidia had won the
                    contract to develop software on the project, while Valeo was
                    providing ultrasonic sensor hardware. The lawsuit claims: 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “On March 8, 2022, one of these videoconference meetings was
                    scheduled. Mr. Moniruzzaman, now employed by Nvidia,
                    attended the videoconference call… and shared his computer
                    screen during the call. When he minimized the PowerPoint
                    presentation he had been sharing, however, he revealed one
                    of Valeo’s verbatim source code files open on his computer.
                    So brazen was Mr. Moniruzzaman’s theft, the file path on his
                    screen still read “ValeoDocs.” Valeo participants on the
                    videoconference call immediately recognized the source code
                    and took a screenshot before Mr. Moniruzzaman was alerted of
                    his error. By then it was too late to cover his tracks.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit goes on to state that German police “discovered
                    Valeo documentation and hardware pinned on the walls of Mr.
                    Moniruzzaman’s home office” when they raided his home as
                    part of a criminal investigation, and that Valeo’s software
                    and documents were found on his Nvidia computer when it was
                    seized by investigators. Moniruzzaman admitted to stealing
                    Valeo’s software when questioned by German police, according
                    to the lawsuit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As a result, Valeo is seeking damages and an
                    injunction to stop Nvidia and its employees from using or
                    sharing its trade secrets.

                    Given vast computing resources, the new model was able to
                    solve certain mathematical problems, the person said on
                    condition of anonymity because the individual was not
                    authorized to speak on behalf of the company. Though only
                    performing math on the level of grade-school students, acing
                    such tests made researchers very optimistic about Q*’s
                    future success, the source said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once math is conquered, AI will have greater reasoning
                    capabilities resembling human intelligence. After that, AI
                    could work on novel scientific research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The letter flagged the potential danger of Q-Star, although
                    it’s unclear what the safety concerns are. Generally
                    speaking, researchers worry that the dawn of AI might also
                    lead to the demise of the human species.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As more intelligent AI comes along, it might decide that
                    destroying the human species might better serve its
                    interests. It sounds like the premise of
                    <em>Terminator</em> and <em>Matrix</em>, but it’s one fear
                    AI researchers have.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It’s unclear whether Q-Star is the key development that
                    could lead there. But we’ll only know after the fact.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers have also flagged work by an “AI scientist”
                    team, the existence of which multiple sources confirmed. The
                    group, formed by combining earlier “Code Gen” and “Math Gen”
                    teams, was exploring how to optimize existing AI models to
                    improve their reasoning and eventually perform scientific
                    work, one of the people said.

                  <p>
                    While OpenAI is yet to confirm this rumored innovation, Sam
                    Altman did tease a big breakthrough in the days preceding
                    his ouster.

                    NASA has celebrated a shipment of half a kilo of plutonium
                    oxide by the US Department of Energy, the largest since US
                    production of plutonium-238 was restarted just over a decade
                    ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Plutonium-238 (Pu-238) is essential for NASA missions using
                    Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS). RPS makes use of the
                    natural decay of Pu-238 to provide heat and electricity
                    through systems such as the Multi-Mission Radioisotope
                    Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG). As such, it's essential
                    for missions where solar power is not an option.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA's recent Mars rovers use the fuel, and Perseverance
                    uses an MMRTG to provide the robot with continuous heat and
                    approximately 110 watts of electricity. Other missions, such
                    as Cassini, also used the isotope, and Pu-238 power has kept
                    the Voyager probes running decades after the launch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, supplies have been limited. Pu-238 is a byproduct
                    of the process used to make nuclear weapons. As the need for
                    new nuclear weapons has ebbed over the years, stockpiles of
                    the fuel have dwindled. In 2015,
                    <a

                    >
                    estimated that approximately 35 kg remained available to
                    NASA, and of that, only 17 kg was good enough to use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hence the need to restart production. In 2010, the US
                    Department of Energy submitted a
                    <a

                    production rate of 1.5 kg per year by 2015. According to
                    NASA, that target won't be hit until at least 2026.

                    One chemical used in some anti-cancer drugs, for example,
                    costs pharmaceutical companies $3,200 per gram—50 times more
                    than a gram of gold. The UCLA researchers devised an
                    inexpensive way to produce this drug molecule from a
                    chemical costing just $3 per gram. They were also able to
                    apply the process to produce many other chemicals used in
                    medicine and agriculture for a fraction of the usual cost.

                    Industrial production of amines is therefore of great
                    interest, but the raw materials and reagents are often
                    expensive, and the processes can require many complicated
                    steps to complete. Using fewer steps and no expensive
                    ingredients, the process developed at UCLA can produce
                    valuable chemicals at a much lower cost than current
                    methods.

                    enough. In 1974, when I bought my first electronic
                    calculator, the AA battery had a carbon rod core and an
                    outer casing of zinc. Intensive research and development
                    since then has provided us with the lithium-ion battery,
                    which can store six times as much electrical energy in the
                    same volume. However, the energy density is still 40 times
                    worse than petrol. Experts suggest that the best we can hope
                    for is an improvement by a factor of two over the next 50

                    most likely outcome is that BEVs will be a rerun of the
                    Concorde story, ending up as a short-lived plaything for the
                    wealthy few, and for a similar complex set of reasons."

                I think a mix of EV and ICE is best, both have strong and weak
                sides. It is stupid to develop a crash program for expensive
                technology as a solution to what many good scientists consider a
                non-problem.

                    Legacy AMD Radeon graphics cards, such as those based on the
                    company's original GCN architecture from early 2010s, can
                    run on practically all platforms under Linux, according

                    kernel-mode FPU support that were not supported on RISC-V —
                    which is why they could not work on RISC-V boards out of the
                    box, and required manual patching.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This issue is now being fixed thanks to new updates from
                    SiFive, and it looks promising for the upcoming Linux 6.8
                    kernel release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This series allows using newer AMD GPUs (e.g., Navi) on
                    RISC-V boards such as SiFive's HiFive Unmatched," a
                    statement by SiFive reads. "Those GPUs need
                    CONFIG_DRM_AMD_DC_FP to initialize, which requires
                    kernel-mode FPU support."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These changes are under review and are expected to be
                    included in the next Linux 6.8 kernel release, and will make
                    it easier to use the latest AMD Radeon graphics cards with
                    RISC-V and open-source drivers.

                    Abandoned animals, kids with cancer, disabled veterans:
                    These and other pitches for charity can move your emotions
                    and have you reaching for your credit card.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But beware: Especially around the holidays, fake charity
                    scammers are hard at work trying to part you from your
                    hard-earned cash.
                  </p>
                  <p>But scammers also know how to build trust, she warned.</p>
                  <p>
                    "They may call you using a local phone number," Parti said
                    in a Virginia Tech news release. "That tactic can give you a
                    false sense of security."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You then start listening to their pitch, expertly designed
                    to play on your emotions and often confusingly misleading.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It will be a good one. It will tug at your heartstrings,"
                    Parti said. "But listen closely because they will never
                    actually specify how they will help. They may even claim
                    that you've donated before and ask you to do it again."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Is this a real charity or a scammer? To quickly find out,
                    check databases like the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/search-for-tax-exempt-organizations"

                    <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/">Charity Watch</a> to
                    see if the group being pitched is legit, Parti said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And pay very close attention to the <i>name</i> of the
                    charity: One common ruse is to give listeners a name that
                    very closely mimics that of a legitimate charity. If it's
                    just a shade different from the title of another well-known
                    charity (for example, American Society for Cancer, not
                    American Cancer Society), it could be a scam.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scammers will try and get all the personal info from you
                    they can: While a legit charity may simply want credit card
                    info for a donation, a scammer may go further and try and
                    get your Social Security number or bank account details.
                    Don't fall for it, Parti said.

                    Archaeologists from University College Dublin, working with
                    colleagues from Serbia and Slovenia, have uncovered a
                    previously unknown network of massive sites in the heart of
                    Europe that could explain the emergence of the continent's
                    Bronze Age megaforts—the largest prehistoric constructions
                    seen prior to the Iron Age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using satellite images and aerial photography to stitch
                    together the prehistoric landscape of the south Carpathian
                    Basin in Central Europe, the team discovered more than 100
                    sites belonging to a complex society.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their commonplace use of defensible enclosures was a
                    precursor and likely influence behind the famous hillforts
                    of Europe, built to protect communities later in the Bronze
                    Age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Some of the largest sites, we call these mega-forts, have
                    been known for a few years now, such as Gradište Iđoš,
                    Csanádpalota, Sântana or the mind-blowing Corneşti Iarcuri
                    enclosed by 33km of ditches and eclipsing in size the
                    contemporary citadels and fortifications of the Hittites,
                    Mycenaeans or Egyptians," said lead author Associate
                    Professor Barry Molloy, UCD School of Archaeology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What is new, however, is finding that these massive sites
                    did not stand alone, they were part of a dense network of
                    closely related and codependent communities. At their peak,
                    the people living within this lower Pannonian network of
                    sites must have numbered into the tens of thousands."

                  <p>
                    The Carpathian Basin extends across parts of central and
                    southeast Europe, with the vast Pannonian Plain lying at its
                    center, with the River Danube cutting through it.

                After 25 years of keeping the internet strong and stable, the

                    "It's super important to differentiate between what
                    countries decide to do with controlling content, as opposed
                    to the technical infrastructure," the Internet Corporation
                    for Assigned Names and Numbers' interim chief executive
                    Sally Costerton told AFP in a recent interview.

                    [...] But as online abuses -- from misinformation to hateful
                    content -- have grown more insidious, interest has
                    heightened in giving governments more control of the
                    internet, including aspects that have previously been
                    covered by ICANN.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shifting control of the internet's infrastructure to
                    governments and trade groups, and shutting out the technical
                    community, could crack its foundation, Costerton warned.

                    [...] "We are living in an increasingly nationalistic,

                    Nvidia has given the world a "SuperNIC" – another device to
                    improve network performance, just like the "SmartNIC," the
                    "data processing unit" (DPU), and the "infrastructure
                    processing unit" (IPU). But the GPU-maker insists its new
                    device is more than just a superlative.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So what exactly is a SuperNIC? An Nvidia
                    <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-supernic/"
                      >explainer</a
                    >
                    describes it as a "new class of networking accelerator
                    designed to supercharge AI workloads in Ethernet-based
                    networks." Key features include high-speed packet
                    reordering, advanced congestion control, programmable I/O
                    pathing, and, critically, integration with Nvidia's broader
                    hardware and software portfolio.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If that sounds like what a SmartNIC or DPU would do, you're
                    not wrong. The SuperNIC is even based on a current Nvidia
                    DPU, the BlueField-3.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nvidia's BlueField-3 SuperNIC promises Infiniband-ish
                    network performance – if you buy Nvidia's fancy 51.2Tbit/sec
                    switches – Click to enlarge. Source: Nvidia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The difference is the SuperNIC is designed to work alongside
                    Nvidia's own Spectrum-4 switches as part of its Spectrum-X
                    offering.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nvidia's senior veep for networking, Kevin Deierling,
                    emphasized in an interview with <em>The Register</em> that
                    the SuperNIC isn't a rebrand of the DPU, but rather a
                    different product.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before considering the SuperNIC, it's worth remembering that
                    SmartNICs/IPUs/DPUs are network interface controllers (NICs)
                    that include modest compute capabilities – sometimes
                    fixed-function ASICs, with or without a couple of Arm cores
                    sprinkled in, or even highly customizable FPGAs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of Intel and AMD's SmartNICs are based around FPGAs,
                    while Nvidia's BlueField-3 class of NICs pairs Arm cores
                    with a bunch of dedicated accelerator blocks for things like
                    storage, networking, and security offload.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This variety means that certain SmartNICs are better suited,
                    or at the very least marketed, towards certain applications
                    more than others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the most part, we've seen SmartNICs – or whatever your
                    preferred vendor wants to call them – deployed in one of two
                    scenarios. The first is in large cloud and hyperscale
                    datacenters where they're used to offload and accelerate
                    storage, networking, security, and even hypervisor
                    management from the host CPU.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    A study published in Diversity provides new insight into how
                    toothed whales and dolphins came to navigate the underwater
                    world using sound waves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Whales and dolphins, which lack external ears, rely on a
                    technique called echolocation to navigate and hunt in the
                    dark. Much like shouting and listening for echoes, these
                    animals emit high-pitched sounds that bounce off objects and
                    reflect back at them, allowing them to map out their
                    surroundings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their skulls and soft tissues near and within the blowhole
                    are asymmetrical, meaning that a structure on one side is
                    larger or differently shaped than its counterpart on the
                    other side. This "lopsidedness" enables the production of
                    sound. At the same time, a fat-filled lower jawbone conducts
                    sound waves to the internal ear, allowing the animals to
                    locate where sounds are coming from (directional hearing).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yet, how whales and dolphins evolved this sophisticated
                    "built-in sonar" is not fully understood.

                    The researchers analyzed a large collection of fossils that
                    included two ancient species of dolphins within the genus
                    Xenorophus, one of which is new to science. These species
                    are some of the primitive members of Odontoceti, the
                    suborder of marine mammals that includes all living
                    echolocating whales and dolphins.

                  unearthed in China, shows that neolithic people were capable
                  of complex engineering feats without the need for a

                    In a study published in <em>Nature Water</em>, the
                    archaeological team describe a network of ceramic water
                    pipes and drainage ditches at the Chinese walled site of
                    Pingliangtai dating back 4,000 years to a time known as the
                    Longshan period. The network shows cooperation amongst the
                    community to build and maintain the drainage system, though
                    no evidence of a centralised power or authority.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr Yijie Zhuang (UCL Institute of Archaeology), senior and
                    corresponding author on the paper, said: "The discovery of
                    this ceramic water pipe network is remarkable because the
                    people of Pingliangtai were able to build and maintain this
                    advanced water management system with stone age tools and
                    without the organisation of a central power structure. This
                    system would have required a significant level of
                    community-wide planning and coordination, and it was all
                    done communally."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ceramic water pipes make up a drainage system which is
                    the oldest complete system ever discovered in China. Made by
                    interconnecting individual segments, the water pipes run
                    along roads and walls to divert rainwater and show an
                    advanced level of central planning at the neolithic site.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What's surprising to researchers is that the settlement of
                    Pingliangtai shows little evidence of social hierarchy. Its
                    houses were uniformly small and show no signs of social
                    stratification or significant inequality amongst the
                    population. Excavations at the town's cemetery likewise
                    found no evidence of a social hierarchy in burials, a marked
                    difference from excavations at other nearby towns of the
                    same era.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The level of complexity associated with these pipes refutes
                    an earlier understanding in archaeological fields that holds
                    that only a centralised state power with governing elites
                    would be able to muster the organisation and resources to
                    build a complex water management system. While other ancient
                    societies with advanced water systems tended to have a
                    stronger, more centralised governance, or even despotism,
                    Pingliangtai demonstrates that was not always needed, and
                    more egalitarian and communal societies were capable of
                    these kinds of engineering feats as well.

                "When you typically see a shock diamond or a mach diamond, it
                can be from like a jet engine test, or a single rocket nozzle
                test. [When you] look at those up close... you see the same
                shock diamond effect on the smaller scale."

              <p>
                "But what was interesting, specifically about this case [the
                second Starship launch], is you had 33 engines firing together,
                which you would kind of intuitively think would make for a
                pretty messy environment. I think close up [this] is probably

                    If there's one thing most office workers can agree on, it's
                    that they tend to feel less productive toward the end of the
                    day and the end of each work week. Now, a team of
                    researchers at Texas A&amp;M University has found objective
                    evidence of this phenomenon in action.

                    used a novel method of data collection to show that
                    employees really are less active and more prone to mistakes
                    on afternoons and Fridays, with Friday afternoon
                    representing the lowest point of worker productivity.

                    use employee self-reports, supervisory evaluations or
                    wearable technology, but these can be subjective and
                    invasive," said Benden, professor and head of the Department
                    of Environmental and Occupational Health. "Instead, we used
                    computer usage metrics — things like typing speed, typing
                    errors and mouse activity — to get objective, noninvasive
                    data on computer work patterns."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team then compared computer usage patterns across
                    different days of the week and times of the day to see what
                    kinds of patterns emerged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We found that computer use increased during the week, then
                    dropped significantly on Fridays," said Roh, assistant
                    professor in the Department of Epidemiology and
                    Biostatistics. "People typed more words and had more mouse
                    movement, mouse clicks and scrolls every day from Monday
                    through Thursday, then less of this activity on Friday."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition, Roh said, computer use decreased every
                    afternoon, and especially on Friday afternoons.

                    [...] What is the takeaway for employers? To start, flexible
                    work arrangements, such as hybrid work or a four-day work
                    week, may lead to happier and more productive employees.

                    The researchers—working in close collaboration with the
                    Royal Danish Navy—first identified World War II mines near a
                    busy shipping route off the coast of Denmark, choosing the
                    sites of two intact and two corroded devices. Divers from
                    the Navy collected ocean water and ocean floor sediment
                    around the mines, and researchers then used mass
                    spectrometry to measure the samples' levels of TNT. As the
                    researchers expected, chemical contamination was higher near
                    the corroded mines than the intact ones.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, using either a low-powered detonation or a
                    high-powered detonation, the team destroyed the leaking
                    mines and assessed the TNT released from the blasts.
                    Sediment contained up to 100 million times more TNT after
                    the weaker explosion and only 250 times more TNT after the
                    stronger blast. Similarly, the TNT levels in water after the
                    weaker blast far exceeded those around the stronger one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers say that the pollution released by the
                    low-power blast meets or exceeds levels previously reported
                    to be toxic to microalgae, sea urchins, and fish. Because of
                    the potential threats to nearby marine life, the researchers
                    encourage less invasive methods to remediate submerged World
                    War II relics—like robotic techniques to open and remove
                    abandoned mines' explosive contents—to prevent unwanted
                    explosions and contamination.

                    "If traumatic memories are not stored away properly, their
                    contents will come spilling out when the closet door opens,
                    often without warning. This is why ordinary events, such as
                    fireworks, can trigger flashbacks of traumatic experiences,
                    such as surviving a bombing or gunfire," he said. "We think
                    we can deploy positive emotions, possibly using music, to
                    help people with PTSD put that original memory in a box and
                    reintegrate it, so that negative emotions don't spill over

                    described as a military reconnaissance satellite failed in

                    in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage
                    flight. It promised to tweak the system and engine

                    launch also failed, ending up in the Yellow Sea. That
                    failure was attributed to an "abnormal starting of the
                    second-stage engine after the separation of the first

                    understanding them can help mathematicians make major
                    discoveries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There's just one problem. Fano varieties are notoriously
                    difficult to categorize.

                  <p>
                    That's what scientists at the Imperial College of London
                    discovered when they set out to create a "periodic table of
                    shapes"

                    elements on the periodic table, this geometric table aims to
                    group related Fano varieties together. [More (<i>sic</i>)]

                    method were published in the journal

                    "Fano varieties are basic building blocks in geometry—they
                    are 'atomic pieces' of mathematical shapes," the study
                    reads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Fano discovered the first of these "atomic" shapes
                    back in the 1930s. More have been discovered since, but so
                    far, they lack any organizing principle. Once categorized in

                    could be discovered (much like what the periodic table does
                    for chemists and physicists).

                    "Apart from run-of-the-mill jamming (e.g., with chirp
                    jammers), we have captured GPS spoofing signals in our radio
                    trawling," he said. "But, interestingly, the spoofing
                    signals never seemed to be complete. They were either
                    missing key internal data or were not mutually consistent,
                    and so would not have fooled a GPS receiver. They seemed to
                    be aimed at denial of service rather than actual deception.
                    My students and I came to realize that spoofing is the new
                    jamming. In other words, it is being used for denial of
                    service because it's more effective for that purpose than
                    blunt jamming."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Humphreys said the new attacks were highly significant as
                    unlike GPS jamming, spoofing, which he says acts like a
                    zero-day exploit against aviation systems, also corrupts the
                    IRS and backups, posing more of a threat to an aircraft's
                    safety.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    GPS spoofing has also been used by Israel to try and protect
                    itself from Hezbollah missile strikes, potentially
                    endangering commercial aircraft. Israel has warned pilots
                    landing in the country that they shouldn't rely on GPS to
                    land, instead relying on other methods.

                    Some online comments were visible when I looked the MT
                    story--first one was clearly from a car salesperson, along
                    the lines of, "So I'm going to be giving test rides and not
                    getting a commission?"

                    Like a lot of things on Amazon these days, your submitter
                    suspects that you will be paying a premium price, and not
                    getting the same deal that you could negotiate at the dealer
                    (end of quarter sales quotas, things like that).

                    is described as a version of the MQ1C Gray Eagle drone that
                    has been adapted for short take-off and landing (STOL) from
                    "austere" runways where it would otherwise not be possible
                    to operate large unmanned aircraft like the Predator.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is how it is able to operate from the Royal Navy’s
                    Queen Elizabeth-class ships, which lack the catapults and
                    arresting gear that are normally used to launch and recover
                    fixed-wing planes from aircraft carriers. The F-35B fighters
                    that the UK's navy operates launch using a ramp at the bow
                    of the ship and typically perform a vertical landing, like
                    their Sea Harrier predecessors.

                    Mojave is 9 meters (29 ft) long and has a 16 meter (52 ft)
                    wingspan. It is claimed to be able to carry up to 1.633
                    metric tons (3,600 lb) in payload, the equivalent of 16
                    AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. Configured for a surveillance
                    mode, it is said to be capable of staying aloft for more
                    than 20 hours, which is one of the attractions of this type
                    of aircraft, as they don't need to carry any crew.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During the first trial take-off and landing, the Mojave
                    didn't carry anything, however, so further tests will be
                    required to see how easy it is to operate an aircraft like
                    this when carrying weapons or sensor payloads, and in
                    varying weather conditions. It also unclear how easy it will
                    be to land a drone safely on the Queen Elizabeth-class ships
                    when there are other aircraft such as F-35 fighters parked
                    on the deck.

                    The best heart rate for burning fat differs for each
                    individual and often does not align with the "fat burning
                    zone" on commercial exercise machines, Icahn School of
                    Medicine at Mount Sinai researchers report.

                  <p>
                    Instead, the researchers said, clinical exercise testing—a
                    diagnostic procedure to measure a person's physiological
                    response to exercise—may be a more useful tool to help
                    individuals achieve intended fat loss goals. The study,
                    which used a machine learning-based modeling approach, was
                    published online today in
                    <em

                    "People with a goal of weight or fat loss may be interested
                    in exercising at the intensity which allows for the maximal
                    rate of fat burning. Most commercial exercise machines offer
                    a 'fat-burning zone' option, depending upon age, sex, and
                    heart rate," says lead author Hannah Kittrell, MS, RD, CDN,
                    a PhD candidate at Icahn Mount Sinai in the Augmented
                    Intelligence in Medicine and Science laboratory. "However,
                    the typically recommended fat-burning zone has not been
                    validated, thus individuals may be exercising at intensities
                    that are not aligned with their personalized weight loss
                    goals."

                      >Government Surveillance Reform Act</a
                    >, was announced last week and focuses on narrowing the
                    government’s authority to collect information on US
                    citizens.

                    It would require warrants to collect Americans’ location
                    data and web browsing or search records under the program
                    and documentation that the queries were “reasonably likely
                    to retrieve foreign intelligence information.” In a hearing
                    before the House Committee on Homeland Security on
                    Wednesday, Wray
                    <a

                      >said that a warrant requirement</a
                    >
                    would be a “significant blow” to the program, calling it a
                    “de facto ban.”

                  <p>
                    Senator Ron Wyden, who cosponsored the reform bill and sits
                    on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has said
                    <a
                      href="https://www.wired.com/story/section-702-surveillance-reauthorization-privacy-letter/"
                      >he won’t vote to renew</a
                    >
                    the program unless some of its powers are curbed. “Congress
                    must have a real debate about reforming warrantless
                    government surveillance of Americans,” Wyden said in a
                    statement to MIT Technology Review. “Therefore, the
                    administration and congressional leaders should listen to
                    the overwhelming bipartisan coalition that supports adopting
                    common-sense protections for Americans’ privacy and
                    extending key national security authorities at the same
                    time.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The reform bill does not,
                    <a

                      >as some civil society groups had hoped</a
                    >, limit the government’s powers for surveillance of people
                    outside of the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While it’s not yet clear whether these reforms will pass,
                    intelligence agencies have never faced such a broad,
                    bipartisan coalition of opponents. As for what happens next,
                    we’ll have to wait and see.

                characters made from said clay. Unfortunately the factory which
                made the special clay has gone under and although Aardman
                Studios bought out their stocks as they closed, the studio is
                now running terminally low on the clay:

                    This Plasticine-like substance is an animator's dream: it's
                    easy to mould, yet keeps its shape under hot studio lights.
                    But in March this year, the only factory that made it, on
                    the outskirts of Torquay, shut up shop. When its closure was
                    announced, Aardman bought up every last block of Lewis
                    Newplast that remained in the warehouse – enough for just
                    one more film: the new Wallace &amp; Gromit, coming in 2024.
                    After that, until a suitable replacement can be found, or
                    invented, that's it.
