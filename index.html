                <div>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft knew cloud gaming would be a key concern, and
                    that's why it has spent the past couple of months preparing
                    by signing deals with Boosteroid, Ubitus, and Nvidia to
                    allow Xbox PC games to run on rival cloud gaming services.
                    These 10-year deals will also include access to
                    <em>Call of Duty</em> and other Activision Blizzard games if
                    Microsoft's deal is approved by regulators. If it's not
                    approved, then the deals are off for Activision games, with
                    only access to Microsoft's Xbox PC games being supplied.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Most of this deal now rests on the European Union's
                    shoulders. The cloud deals Microsoft has been signing are
                    also designed to appease regulators in the EU.
                    <em>Reuters</em> reported last month that the Activision
                    deal is likely to be approved by EU regulators following the
                    Nvidia and Nintendo licensing agreements. The EU is due to
                    make a decision by May 22nd, and Microsoft is once again
                    trying to get out ahead of regulators by signing a fresh
                    deal with European cloud gaming platform Nware. Nvidia and
                    Boosteroid, which both signed Microsoft's 10-year cloud
                    deal, have
                    <a
                      href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGFN/status/1651662502269165586"
                      >publicly questioned</a
                    >
                    the CMA's decision, with Microsoft hoping this kind of
                    backing will sway EU regulators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An EU approval could offer a glimmer of hope for Microsoft's
                    giant deal, as such a move would put pressure on the UK as
                    the only major market to outright block the acquisition.
                    Regulators in Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Chile, Serbia, Japan,
                    and South Africa have already approved the deal. Microsoft
                    does face trouble closer to home, though.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the US, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block
                    Microsoft and Activision Blizzard's deal late last year. The
                    FTC case is still at the document discovery stage, with an
                    evidentiary hearing scheduled for August 2nd. Microsoft and
                    Sony lawyers are already arguing over which (and how many)
                    documents should be presented as part of the legal discovery
                    process, and we're months away from knowing how the case
                    will proceed.

                    It may not work so well yet, but the experiment raises
                    ethical issues around the possible future use of brain
                    decoders for surveillance and interrogation. With this in
                    mind, the team set out to test whether you could train and
                    run a decoder without a person's cooperation. They did this
                    by trying to decode perceived speech from each participant
                    using decoder models trained on data from another person.
                    They found that they performed "barely above chance."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This, they say, suggests that a decoder couldn't be applied
                    to someone's brain activity unless that person was willing
                    and had helped train the decoder in the first place.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We think that mental privacy is really important, and that
                    nobody's brain should be decoded without their cooperation,"
                    says Jerry Tang, a PhD student at the university who worked
                    on the project. "We believe it's important to keep
                    researching the privacy implications of brain decoding, and
                    enact policies that protect each person's mental privacy."

                    Hoogland shared a story of recognizing the significance of
                    the web, and trying to interest commercial software
                    companies in the tech.
                  </p>
                  <p>All passed.</p>
                  <p>
                    He next tried to convince the European Union to promote the
                    web and make it an exemplar of local ingenuity, but came
                    away thinking that the organization would take too long to
                    make that happen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The decision to release code to the public domain was
                    therefore easy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] CERN later decided an open source licence was a better
                    idea for the web than a complete free-for-all. But that
                    doesn't diminish the significance of the anniversary.

                    MindGeek, the owner of adult platforms such as Pornhub, has
                    blocked everyone in Utah from accessing its sites in protest

                    Utah has been fighting against online pornography for years.
                    It called porn a public health crisis in 2016 and previously
                    proposed that all smartphones and tablets in the state

                    pornography. An age verification law was eventually passed
                    in March, requiring users visiting adult platforms deemed
                    "harmful to minors" to verify their age before being allowed
                    access.

                    writes that any companies that don't comply with the law
                    will be liable if they're sued over minors accessing their
                    content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now that the law has gone into effect, MindGeek has
                    responded by blocking anyone in Utah who tries to access
                    Pornhub. Those with Utah IPs will see only a video of adult
                    performer Cherie DeVille, a member of the Adult Performer
                    Advocacy Committee, explaining the reason for the block.

                  <p>
                    "As you may know, your elected officials in Utah are
                    requiring us to verify your age before allowing you access
                    to our website," DeVille says. "While safety and compliance
                    are at the forefront of our mission, giving your ID card
                    every time you want to visit an adult platform is not the
                    most effective solution for protecting our users, and in
                    fact, will put children and your privacy at risk."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    DeVille adds that "mandating age verification without proper
                    enforcement" drives users to other sites with fewer safety
                    measures in place.

                    Geoffrey Hinton, 75, announced his resignation from Google
                    in a statement to the New York Times, saying he now
                    regretted his work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He told the BBC some of the dangers of AI chatbots were
                    "quite scary". "Right now, they're not more intelligent than
                    us, as far as I can tell. But I think they soon may be."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr Hinton also accepted that his age had played into his
                    decision to leave the tech giant, telling the BBC: "I'm 75,
                    so it's time to retire." Dr Hinton's pioneering research on
                    neural networks and deep learning has paved the way for
                    current AI systems like ChatGPT.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In artificial intelligence, neural networks are systems that
                    are similar to the human brain in the way they learn and
                    process information. They enable AIs to learn from
                    experience, as a person would. This is called deep learning.
                    The British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer
                    scientist told the BBC that chatbots could soon overtake the
                    level of information that a human brain holds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Right now, what we're seeing is things like GPT-4 eclipses
                    a person in the amount of general knowledge it has and it
                    eclipses them by a long way. In terms of reasoning, it's not
                    as good, but it does already do simple reasoning," he said.
                    "And given the rate of progress, we expect things to get
                    better quite fast. So we need to worry about that."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] He added: "I've come to the conclusion that the kind
                    of intelligence we're developing is very different from the
                    intelligence we have.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We're biological systems and these are digital systems. And
                    the big difference is that with digital systems, you have
                    many copies of the same set of weights, the same model of
                    the world. "And all these copies can learn separately but
                    share their knowledge instantly. So it's as if you had
                    10,000 people and whenever one person learnt something,
                    everybody automatically knew it. And that's how these
                    chatbots can know so much more than any one person."

                    elections and wars "Look, here's one way it could all go

                    nothing more than make some noise and embarrass yourself.
                    It's all there in the Mullvad FAQ, including the fact that

                  <p>
                    This policy isn't in place because Mullvad wants to protect
                    criminals. It's in place because people all over the world
                    deserve protection from government overreach. That criminals
                    may benefit from policies like these doesn't make these
                    policies bad, it just makes it more difficult for abusive
                    governments to engage in third-party-enabled surveillance.

                According to one of the relevant laws, the government can only
                grant the police permission to search the premises if it can be
                tangibly demonstrated that there is a reasonable expectation of
                finding items subject to seizure. Given that Mullvad neither
                collects that information nor is required to collect that
                information, there was no basis for the raid except, I
                conjecture, for possible harassment.

                    [...] With Python 3.12, Snow and his cohort cleaned up
                    Python's internals enough to make subinterpreters useful,
                    and they are adding a minimal module to the Python standard
                    library called interpreters. This gives programmers a
                    rudimentary way to launch subinterpreters and execute code
                    on them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Another major set of performance improvements Shannon
                    mentioned, Python's new adaptive specializing interpreter,
                    was discussed in detail in a separate session by core Python
                    developer Brandt Bucher.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Python 3.11 introduced new bytecodes to the interpreter,
                    called <em>adaptive instructions</em>. These instructions
                    can be replaced automatically at runtime with versions
                    specialized for a given Python type, a process called
                    <em>quickening</em>. This saves the interpreter the step of
                    having to look up what types the objects are, speeding up
                    the whole process enormously. For instance, if a given
                    addition operation regularly takes in two integers, that
                    instruction can be replaced with one that assumes the
                    operands are both integers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Python objects have historically used a lot of memory.
                    A Python 3 object header, even without the data for the
                    object, occupied 208 bytes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the last several versions of Python, though, various
                    efforts took place to streamline the way Python objects were
                    designed, finding ways to share memory or represent things
                    more compactly. Shannon outlined how as of Python 3.12, the
                    object header's now a mere 96 bytes—slightly less than half
                    of what it was before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These changes don't just allow more Python objects to be
                    kept in memory, they also improve cache locality for Python
                    objects. While that by itself may not speed things up as
                    significantly as other efforts, it's still a boon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The default Python implementation, CPython, has three
                    decades of development behind it. That also means three
                    decades of cruft, legacy APIs, and design decisions that can
                    be hard to transcend—all of which make it hard to improve
                    Python in key ways.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] One key issue is the proliferation of C APIs found in
                    CPython, the reference runtime for the language. As of
                    Python 3.8,
                    <a
                      href="https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/c-api/index.html"
                      >there are a few different sets of APIs</a
                    >, each with different maintenance requirements. Over the
                    last five years, Stinner worked to make many public APIs
                    private, so programmers don't need to deal as directly with
                    sensitive CPython internals. The long-term goal is to make
                    components that use the C APIs, like Python extension
                    modules, less dependent on things that might change with
                    each version.

                I think that many people had already reached this conclusion but

                    In a Twitter audio chat on Saturday, SpaceX's founder, Elon
                    Musk, shared more details about what went awry during

                    rocket and Super Heavy booster launch in April. One of the
                    biggest revelations: The self-destruct setting took 40
                    seconds to work — a seemingly short time, except when you're
                    uncertain if the massive rocket you just launched will blow
                    up before hitting land. To recap the day's events, the
                    rocket and booster cleared the launch pad before being
                    unable to separate from each other, flipping and, finally,
                    blowing up. The automated command should have immediately
                    caused an explosion, but tumbled around for a bit first.

                    In one of many spins on the day's failures, Musk claimed it
                    was because "the vehicle's structural margins appear to be
                    better than we expected." While SpaceX previously said the

                    The delayed self-destruction wasn't the only issue following
                    the launch from SpaceX's facility in Boca Chica, Texas.
                    After the eventual explosion,

                    The latter resulted in a 3.5-acre fire. Musk's response? "To
                    the best of our knowledge there has not been any meaningful
                    damage to the environment that we're aware of."

                  <p>
                    The FAA has already announced it's investigating the events
                    and will ground Starship until "determining that any system,
                    process or procedure related to the mishap does not affect
                    public safety." Even with all of that, Musk went so far as
                    to call the launch "successful" and "maybe slightly
                    exceeding my expectations."

                    British microchip designing giant Arm has filed to sell its
                    shares in the US, setting the stage for what could be the

                    The Cambridge-based firm is reportedly aiming to raise up to
                    $10bn (£8bn). In a blow to the UK, the company said in March
                    that it did not plan to list its shares in London.

                  <p>
                    Arm was bought in 2016 by Japanese conglomerate Softbank in
                    a deal worth £23.4bn. At the time Arm was listed in London
                    and New York.

                  <p>
                    Softbank said it had "confidentially submitted a draft

                    Bhutan's Ministry of Finance did not respond to a list of
                    questions from <em>Forbes</em> about the scope of the
                    enterprise. It's unclear when mining began, where it's
                    located and whether the scheme has turned a profit. (As for
                    the start date, bitcoin was valued at $5,000 in April 2019.)
                    It's also unclear why Bhutan never disclosed the project to
                    its citizens or international partners.

                    [...] Bhutan's government appears to have considered working
                    with other miners beyond Bitdeer. Insiders at rival services
                    and pools, where miners share compute power to unlock new
                    bitcoin blocks faster, said they have held advanced talks
                    with senior government officials, including Druk, about the
                    kingdom building and operating a hydro-powered operation.
                    Consultants who advised the government on its mining
                    strategy prior to Bitdeer's announcement told
                    <em>Forbes</em> that Bhutan had previously inquired about a
                    100 MW operation hooked into one of its hydroelectric
                    plants.

                    development potential," says Isak Engquist, senior associate
                    professor at the Laboratory for Organic Electronics
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In previous trials, transistors made of wood have been able
                    to regulate ion transport only. And when the ions run out,
                    the transistor stops functioning. The transistor developed
                    by the Linköping researchers, however, can function
                    continuously and regulate electricity flow without
                    deteriorating.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers used balsa wood to create their transistor,
                    as the technology involved requires a grainless wood that is
                    evenly structured throughout. They removed the lignin,
                    leaving only long cellulose fibres with channels where the
                    lignin had been.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These channels were then filled with a conductive plastic,
                    or polymer, called PEDOT:PSS, resulting in an electrically
                    conductive wood material.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers used this to build the wood transistor and
                    could show that it is able to regulate electric current and
                    provide continuous function at a selected output level. It
                    could also switch the power on and off, albeit with a
                    certain delay – switching it off took about a second; on,
                    about five seconds.

                Hospital and university clinics have historically helped people
                post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and phobias using virtual
                reality to immerse them in simulations that help them reckon
                with the problem. It was the foundation of a US Army program
                called BraveMind (
                <a href="https://medvr.ict.usc.edu/projects/bravemind.html"

                ). It is a virtual version of the longstanding technique called
                exposure therapy, in which people confront memories or fears,
                such as fear of flying or confined spaces - done actively with a
                therapist. However, a limited number of virtual-reality
                scenarios are available, and many patients must go to a
                specialized clinic for such care. Last week in the Wall Street
                Journal, they covered that researchers are aiming to make
                immersive VR-based therapy more personal and bring it into
                people's homes.

                    >. So regular TechCrunch readers will already know that a
                    key development Meta is hoping will save its bacon in Europe
                    is the adoption of a new high level data transfer pact which
                    aims to resolve the legal uncertainty around EU data
                    exports.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In its earnings report, Meta tells investors it's
                    hopeful the new EU-US data framework will arrive soon enough
                    to be implemented before the deadline for a suspension of
                    its EU transfers — meaning, were these stars to align, it
                    could reboot its claim to have an authorized mechanism for
                    its EU transfers and flick the suspension order away —
                    however the company also warns it "cannot exclude the
                    possibility" that adoption won't happen soon enough to
                    prevent such an order.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] During a call with investors, the social networking
                    giant was asked about the potential impact on revenues if it
                    is forced to suspend EU-US data flows on regulatory order.
                    Responding, CFO Susan Li began by reiterating its hope that
                    the new high level framework will save its bacon. However,
                    if this sought for escape hatch fails to open in time, she
                    warned investors Meta is facing a hit of around a tenth of
                    its worldwide ad revenue — saying "roughly 10%" of this
                    comes from ads delivered to Facebook users in EU countries.

                    During a recent test at NASA's Johnson Space Center in
                    Houston, scientists were able to produce oxygen from the
                    soil in a vacuum environment for the first time, the space

                    Soil on the Moon contains compounds that could potentially
                    be used to produce oxygen with the help of radiation from
                    the Sun. In order to test that out, a team of scientists
                    from NASA's Carbothermal Reduction Demonstration (CaRD)
                    created fine-grained soil to simulate the material covering
                    the Moon's surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using a high-powered laser that simulated heat from a solar
                    energy concentrator (which is similar to a magnifying lens),
                    the team then melted the lunar soil simulant, NASA
                    explained. After the soil was heated, the scientists
                    detected carbon monoxide using the Mass Spectrometer
                    Observing Lunar Operations (MSolo), a device that was
                    designed to help scientists look for water on the Moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The process of heating the soil and extracting the
                    oxygen took place inside a carbothermal reactor, a device
                    that uses high temperatures to produce carbon monoxide or
                    dioxide on Earth to create items like solar panels and
                    steel, according to NASA. The test was the first time the
                    reactor was used inside the Moon-like chamber, providing
                    possible proof that it can in fact operate in the lunar
                    environment.

                    [...] The Nitrokey post goes on to claim that Qualcomm's
                    XTRA service is not part of /e/OS or Android, but operates
                    from the Qualcomm firmware known as AMSS. "This covert
                    operating system operates on the broadband processor (modem)
                    and manages the real-time communication with the cell

                    A former mobile industry executive familiar with Qualcomm
                    technology told <em>The Register</em> that characterizing
                    AMSS as "a covert operating system" is "total nonsense."

                    However, our source explained, what goes on in phones at a
                    low level isn't really understood by the general public.

                    "The way chipsets work, there's an application processor
                    family," our source explained. "Underneath there's a kernel
                    that hosts and virtualizes the operating system. And there
                    are various subsystems – the modem, the Wi-Fi, peripherals
                    like USB, the display driver, and the GPU. The vendors all
                    have large amounts of software like AMSS that runs there.
                    And they have a choice on what to compile from that image."

                  <p>
                    That's necessary, our source said, "because you can't get a
                    straight answer from the vendors. Some of these features may
                    have five or 10 switches to turn it on. There is a lot of
                    old software. There's a lot of new software. It's very
                    complex and there is a huge amount of it. And it has evolved
                    from generation to generation. It's pretty much hideous,
                    like any major operating system. The only thing I wouldn't
                    call it is 'covert,' because it's been there forever."

                    They also found that the beneficial bacteria in the
                    onggi-made kimchi proliferated 26% more than in the glass
                    counterpart. In the glass jar, the lactic acid bacteria
                    became suffocated by their own carbon dioxide in the closed
                    glass container. It turns out that, because the onggi
                    releases carbon dioxide in small rates, the lactic acid
                    bacteria are happier and reproduce more.

                    [...] "It's amazing that, for thousands of years, people
                    have been building these special containers out of dirt, but
                    in many ways, they are very high tech," Hu said. "We
                    discovered that the right amount of porosity enables kimchi
                    to ferment faster, and these onggi provide that."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kim said that some artisans still use ancient methods when
                    making onggi, but their numbers are decreasing. Now, the
                    market is flooded with inauthentic versions of the vessels.

                    "We hope this study draws attention to this traditional
                    artisan work and inspires energy-efficient methods for
                    fermenting and storing foods," he said. "Also, the onggi are
                    quite beautiful."

                    interplanetary mission, Tianwen-1. It was designed to study
                    Martian geology, mapping and analyzing the terrain while
                    looking for materials useful to support future manned
                    missions. It did that, with aplomb, for an entire year after
                    it landed in May 2021.

                    The rate at which Mars landers succumb to dust is testament
                    to the success of the two rovers currently residing on Mars:
                    NASA's Perseverance and Curiosity. Perseverance has been in
                    operation for almost two years, and Curiosity has trundled
                    around for over a decade. In fact, one of Curiosity's

                    the wear and tear on its

                    Curiosity uses a radioisotope power system to generate
                    electricity from the heat of plutonium's radioactive decay.
                    It has two lithium ion rechargeable batteries for when power
                    demand temporarily exceeds the generator's output.

                    [...] With the introduction of GPT-3, which paved the way
                    for the next-generation chatbots that have impressed us in
                    recent months, OpenAI created, seemingly all at once, a
                    significant leap forward in the study of artificial
                    intelligence. But, once we've taken the time to open up the
                    black box and poke around the springs and gears found
                    inside, we discover that programs like ChatGPT don't
                    represent an alien intelligence with which we must now learn
                    to coexist; instead, they turn out to run on the well-worn
                    digital logic of pattern-matching, pushed to a radically
                    larger scale.

                    Many of them generate power by boiling water. But some use
                    more unusual coolants, such as gas, molten salt, or liquid
                    sodium. Every one of them, however, shares a critical
                    feature: They haven't been built. All the expectations we
                    might have about their costs, electricity production, and so
                    forth are estimates. The only approved small modular design
                    will first be incorporated into a power plant at the end of
                    the decade—if everything goes well. Some other companies
                    plan to be ready to go into production sooner, but their
                    designs aren't yet approved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While these designs are unlikely to compete on cost with
                    renewables, they have a number of potential uses once the
                    low-hanging fruit of decarbonization has been picked. These
                    include helping with managing the intermittency of
                    renewables, providing heat for hard-to-decarbonize
                    industrial processes, and even desalination or the
                    production of hydrogen (either for direct use or for the
                    production of synthetic fuels).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The report acknowledges that the potential utility of
                    next-generation designs is completely up in the air, noting
                    that it will depend on "the evolution of energy policy,
                    comparative economics with other energy technologies, the
                    challenge of building plants on budget and on schedule,
                    future energy demand and the structure of the grid, societal
                    preferences, and the prospect of using nuclear energy for
                    purposes beyond electricity generation."

                      href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-boundary"
                      >is doomed</a
                    >, he can still make measurements (<em>SN: 5/16/14</em>).
                    The laws of physics behave the same just inside the horizon
                    as outside. "At the horizon, you wouldn't even know you fell
                    in," Satishchandran says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Bob observes which slit Alice's particle went through,
                    the particle's quantum state will collapse. That would also
                    let Alice know Bob is there, messing up her experiment. But
                    that's a paradox — nothing done inside a black hole should
                    affect the outside. By the laws of physics, Bob should not
                    be able to communicate with Alice at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The paradox is that black holes are a one-way street,"
                    Satishchandran says. "Nothing done in the interior of a
                    black hole can affect my experiment that I do in the
                    exterior. But we just made up a scenario in which,
                    definitely, the experiment will be affected."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team then guessed at a possible solution to that
                    paradox: The black hole itself forces the quantum state of
                    Alice's particle to collapse, whether Bob is there or not.
                    "It must be that there's an effect that no one has
                    calculated in these theories that comes to the rescue,"
                    Danielson says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rescue came from the fact that charged particles
                    radiate, or emit light, when shaken. No matter how carefully
                    Alice sets up her experiment, her particle will always emit
                    a tiny amount of radiation as she moves it, the physicists
                    showed. That radiation will have a different electromagnetic
                    field depending on which way Alice's particle went.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the radiation crosses the black hole's event horizon,
                    the black hole will register that difference, effectively
                    observing enough about the original particle to destroy its
                    quantum state.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The horizon actually 'knows' which way the particle went,"
                    mathematically speaking, Satishchandran says. Alice blames
                    the black hole for ruining her experiment, not Bob, and the
                    paradox is resolved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team took the idea a step further. If Alice's particle
                    is a graviton, a particle of gravity, the same thing happens
                    as if it were an electron. And if the horizon in question is
                    not a black hole, but the cosmic horizon marking the edge of
                    the visible universe, then Alice's particle

                Many countries are celebrating a public holiday on 1 May. In
                view of this, the weekend/holiday posting rate (5 stories/day)
                will continue through the holiday, with the usual story posting
                rate restarting on Tuesday. I realise that for the USA this is
                NOT a holiday, but we will probably celebrate your own Labor Day
                with you later on this year.

                    Given that there are several options for getting the antenna
                    unstuck and nearly eight years of voyaging left before Juice
                    reaches the Jovian system, Europe probably has a good chance
                    of resolving this issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's also worth noting that the rest of the Juice spacecraft
                    is healthy, and the remainder of the commissioning process
                    has gone smoothly. However, while this antenna is not
                    mission-critical and there are plenty of other scientific
                    instruments on board, this is one of the most important
                    ones.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This issue is reminiscent of the difficulty NASA had in
                    deploying the high-gain antenna on the Galileo spacecraft,
                    which launched to Jupiter in 1989 on the space shuttle. This
                    antenna, needed for high-rate communications between the
                    spacecraft and Earth, remained only partially deployed after
                    years of effort to resolve the issue. NASA ultimately had to
                    end up using a low-gain antenna, which resulted in a much
                    slower rate of data from Galileo.

                    DirectWrite API, now comprises approximately 152,000 lines
                    of Rust code and about 96,000 lines of C++ code. In addition
                    to enhancing security, this new code blend has reportedly
                    brought significant performance improvements (5-15%) to font
                    operations.

                    Windows 10 and 11 are written in C, C++, C#, and Assembly
                    language, with millions of lines of code that will likely
                    never undergo a complete, Rust-based overhaul. However,
                    Windows' main graphics device interface (Win32 GDI) is being
                    ported to Rust, with 36,000 lines of code already converted.
                    "There's actually a SysCall in the Windows kernel now that
                    is implemented in Rust," Weston revealed.

                    Microsoft is not the only major tech company interested in
                    adopting Rust for its primary software products. The
                    memory-safe programming language is already being used by

                    Russia had previously threatened to leave the ISS by 2024,
                    but is now the last of NASA's partners to agree to stay
                    aboard the station for a few more years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Russia has agreed to keep its cosmonauts on board the
                    International Space Station (ISS) until 2028 despite earlier
                    threats to withdraw from the orbiting lab.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA announced that its Russian counterpart "has confirmed
                    it will support continued station operations through 2028,"
                    the space agency wrote in a blog post on Thursday. Russia
                    was the last to sign on to extended operations on the ISS,
                    with Japan, Canada, and the participating countries of the
                    European Space Agency (ESA) having already agreed to support
                    space station operations until 2030, when the ISS is due to
                    retire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In light of geopolitical tensions between Russia and its
                    Western counterparts, Russia had previously threatened to
                    pull out of the ISS in a series of vague statements. The
                    Russian space agency then downplayed its threats, stating
                    that it was planning on leaving the ISS after 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We will fulfill all our obligations to our partners, but
                    the decision to leave this station after 2024 has been
                    made." Yury Borisov, the head of Russia's space agency
                    Roscosmos, told Russian President Vladimir Putin during a
                    meeting in July 2022. "I think that by this time we will
                    begin to assemble the Russian orbital station." At that
                    time, it still wasn't clear whether that meant Russia was
                    planning on staying beyond 2024, or if that was the hard
                    cutoff.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Russia is planning on building its own space station in low
                    Earth orbit. The Russian Orbital Space Station, nicknamed
                    'ROSS,' would launch in two phases. The first phase, which
                    Russia hopes to launch in 2025, would include four modules,
                    while the second phase would add two more modules and a
                    service platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA and Roscosmos have had a longstanding partnership
                    aboard the ISS for more than two decades. There has been at
                    least one NASA astronaut and one Roscosmos cosmonaut on
                    board the space station at all times since the ISS launched
                    in 1998.

                    There is strong evidence – including the detection in
                    different locations around the globe of a radioactive type
                    of iron – that supernovae occurred close to Earth between
                    about two and eight million years ago. Researchers estimate
                    these supernovae were between about 65 and 500 light-years
                    away from Earth.

                    [...] The study reports that although the Earth and the
                    solar system are currently in a safe space in terms of
                    potential supernova explosions, many other planets in the
                    Milky Way are not. These high-energy events would
                    effectively shrink the areas within the Milky Way galaxy,
                    known as the Galactic Habitable Zone, where conditions would
                    be conducive for life.

                    [...] ADAPTIV isn't trying to cancel infrared observations
                    with specialized thermal cloaking tech. Instead, it tries to
                    trick infrared sensors by making them see a different
                    object, like altering the thermal profile of a tank and
                    making it look like a huge harmless rock.

                    That infrared sorcery is achieved using a layer of hexagonal
                    plates that looks like a honeycomb pattern when plastered
                    over the surface of an object that needs to be hidden from
                    the infrared sensors of the enemy. These modules, as BAE
                    Systems describes, can be heated or cooled quickly to adapt
                    to the temperature of the surroundings. But the surface
                    heating is controlled so that the covered surface area
                    creates the infrared visage of a harmless object.

                    Do you peel bananas from the top or bottom? One elephant
                    goes with a third option.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When handed a slightly browning banana, Pang Pha, an Asian
                    elephant at Zoo Berlin, will use her trunk to break the
                    fruit, shake the pulp onto the ground,

                      mouth</a
                    >, researchers report in the April 10
                    <em>Current Biology</em>. The rare behavior, previously
                    recorded in just a few elephants, could help shed light on
                    how the animals learn complex movements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When a zookeeper first told neuroscientist Lena Kaufmann of
                    Humboldt University of Berlin that one of the elephants
                    peeled bananas, she decided to test it out for herself. For
                    weeks, Kaufmann and colleagues couldn't get Pang Pha to
                    replicate the behavior. That's because the way the elephant
                    eats bananas seems to depend on ripeness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pang Pha ate green and yellow bananas whole — peel and all.
                    It was only when Kaufmann offered the gentle giant a
                    brown-spotted banana that she revealed her peeling prowess.
                    But the fruit can't be too brown, Kaufmann's team found.
                    Pang Pha rejected completely brown bananas. Initially she
                    would place them gently on the ground in protest. Now she
                    throws them aside.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The new study shows the value of studying individual
                    animals, Kaufmann says. "There's such a rich landscape of
                    behaviors that we lose if we only look at what all elephants
                    have in common," she says. "If you look at each individual
                    elephant, you can see that they're able to do really amazing
                    things."

                    Sports Direct's parent company says live face-recognition
                    (LFR) technology has cut crime in its shops.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cameras check faces against a watch-list, using a system
                    called Facewatch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Monday, 50 MPs and peers supported a letter opposing the
                    use of LFR by Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, which owns the
                    company and other chains such as Flannels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company says it tells shoppers when the technology is
                    installed in a shop.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Frasers Group told BBC News it took its responsibilities
                    around LFR extremely seriously and stressed its
                    effectiveness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Since installing this technology, we have seen a
                    significant reduction in the number of criminal offences
                    taking place in our stores," it said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The letter criticising its use was organised by campaign
                    groups Big Brother Watch, Liberty and Privacy International.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It says research into face-recognition technology suggests;
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      87% of "matches" in Metropolitan Police trials
                      misidentified innocent people
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      women and people belonging to some ethnic minorities are
                      more likely to be misidentified than white men are
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The technology up-ends the democratic principle of suspicion
                    preceding surveillance and "treats everyone who passes the
                    camera like a potential criminal", the letter adds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Shop managers' requests to add someone to the database
                    had to be backed-up with full witness statements and
                    explanations, which a panel of former police officers
                    reviewed before accepting, Mr Gordon said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There is due process followed to ensure we only include
                    individuals reasonably suspected of crime," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shop staff and "accredited super-recognisers" - analysts
                    with an aptitude for recognising faces - checked every
                    alert, he told BBC News.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mr Gordon disputes the accuracy claims the letter makes
                    about the Met Police's LFR, saying Facewatch is more than
                    99% accurate.

                    the game in Russia) and Henk Rogers (who was instrumental in
                    bringing the game to prominence in the West) have not been
                    all that recognizable to the general public. That has
                    started to change, though, with the recent release of

                    In Ars Technica's latest Unsolved Mysteries video, Pajitnov
                    and Rogers went all the way back to the game's earliest

                    Proponents like Ticknor say VR can immerse incarcerated
                    people in the sights and sounds of modern life and help them
                    develop digital literacy in a secure corrections
                    environment. "When you're role-playing, when you're learning
                    a new skill, the closer you can bring them to doing what
                    they're actually going to have to do out in the real world,
                    the better," says Ethan Moeller, founder and managing
                    director of Virtual Training Partners, which helps
                    organizations successfully implement virtual-­reality
                    tools. "VR does that better than any other training medium."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Others are more skeptical. Like Dr. Cyndi Rickards, an
                    associate teaching professor at Drexel University who leads
                    weekly criminology courses inside Philadelphia prisons.
                    People who are incarcerated wear the "label of inmate on
                    their back. It's a dehumanizing system," she says, "so to
                    suggest that VR is going to reintegrate them into society
                    after being in a punitive system...just further objectifies
                    folks, it continues a pattern of dehumanizing folks, and
                    I've not read any compelling evidence that this is the route
                    we should use to integrate people to be members of a healthy
                    and contributing society."

                    research is based on interventions done with people who are
                    not incarcerated, however.

                    [...] While Valdosta State's Ticknor estimates that fewer
                    than 10% of corrections facilities are currently using VR
                    simulators with incarcerated individuals, she expects that
                    to change soon. "I would be very surprised within five years
                    if this is not a very regular treatment modality for this
                    particular population," she says.

                    practice for companies to only share their Scope 1 and 2
                    emissions, which can make its carbon footprint appear much
                    smaller than it actually is. Tesla's Scope 1 and 2
                    emissions, for example, only add up to 610,000 metric tons
                    of CO2 in 2022. That's minuscule in comparison to the

                    with that announcement was a stipulation that would also
                    require large companies to report their indirect Scope 3

                    doesn't really work, but let's see what happens when we
                    release it to billions of people.'"

                    If we start to see a significant number of deepfakes
                    spreading during the election, it's easy to imagine someone
                    like Donald Trump sharing this kind of content on social
                    media and claiming it's real. A deepfake of President Biden
                    saying something disqualifying could come out shortly before
                    the election, and many people might never find out it was
                    AI-generated. Research has consistently <a

                    >, after all, that fake news spreads further than real news.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even if deepfakes don't become ubiquitous before the 2024
                    election, which is still 18 months away, the mere fact that
                    this kind of content can be created could affect the
                    election. Knowing that fraudulent images, audio, and video
                    can be created relatively easily could make people distrust
                    the legitimate material they come across.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In some respects, deepfakes and generative AI don't even
                    need to be involved in the election for them to still cause
                    disruption, because now the well has been poisoned with this
                    idea that anything could be fake," says Ajder. "That
                    provides a really useful excuse if something inconvenient
                    comes out featuring you. You can dismiss it as fake."

                    However, the difficulty lay in trying to figure out how
                    these synodic periods worked in the context of the 819-day
                    count. Mercury is easy; it has a synodic period of 117 days,
                    which fits into 819 days exactly seven times. But where did
                    the rest of the planets fit?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It turns out that each of the visible planets has a synodic
                    period that exactly matches a number of cycles of the
                    819-day count. Venus' synodic period is 585 days; that
                    matches neatly with 7 counts of 819-days. Mars has a 780-day
                    synodic period; that's exactly 20 counts of 819-days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jupiter and Saturn aren't left out, either. Jupiter's
                    399-day synodic period fits exactly 39 times into 19 counts;
                    and Saturn's 378-day synodic period is a perfect match for 6
                    counts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And there's even a compelling link with the 260-day calendar
                    known as the Tzolkʼin. Twenty 819-day periods is a total of
                    16,380 days. If you multiply the Tzolk'in 63 times, you get
                    16,380 days. In fact, 16,380 is the smallest multiple that
                    260 and 819 have in common. So the two link up beautifully
                    with the 20-cycle 819-day count laid out by Linden and
                    Bricker.

                    [...] Any time historians are required to interpret
                    significant measurements of ancient origins, they run the

                    >. That's not to say Linden and Bricker's proposal is
                    numerology dressed up as academia, though it is important to
                    let science do its work and keep an eye out for critiques
                    and rebuttals.

                    Still, the Maya calendar is far from a simple system based
                    on basic astronomy. We shouldn't be at all surprised that
                    the Maya's measure of the cosmos embraced such a great
                    expanse of space and time.

                    A generation that grew up with Google is forcing professors
                    to rethink their lesson plans
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Catherine Garland, an astrophysicist, started seeing the
                    problem in 2017. She was teaching an engineering course, and
                    her students were using simulation software to model
                    turbines for jet engines. She'd laid out the assignment
                    clearly, but student after student was calling her over for
                    help. They were all getting the same error message: The
                    program couldn't find their files.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Garland thought it would be an easy fix. She asked each
                    student where they'd saved their project. Could they be on
                    the desktop? Perhaps in the shared drive? But over and over,
                    she was met with confusion. "What are you talking about?"
                    multiple students inquired. Not only did they not know where
                    their files were saved — they didn't understand the
                    question.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gradually, Garland came to the same realization that many of
                    her fellow educators have reached in the past four years:
                    the concept of file folders and directories, essential to
                    previous generations' understanding of computers, is
                    gibberish to many modern students.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Professors have varied recollections of when they first saw
                    the disconnect. But their estimates (even the most tentative
                    ones) are surprisingly similar. It's been an issue for four
                    years or so, starting — for many educators — around the fall
                    of 2017.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's approximately when Lincoln Colling, a lecturer in the
                    psychology department at the University of Sussex, told a
                    class full of research students to pull a file out of a
                    specific directory and was met with blank stares. It was the
                    same semester that Nicolás Guarín-Zapata, an applied
                    physicist and lecturer at Colombia's Universidad EAFIT,
                    noticed that students in his classes were having trouble
                    finding their documents. It's the same year that posts began
                    to pop up on STEM-educator forums asking for help explaining
                    the concept of a file.

                While some of us may find this phenomenon strange to understand
                it is becoming increasingly real for many. Are there any other
                examples of things that we take for granted becoming
                incomprehensible to those younger that ourselves? I'm not
                thinking of 'hanging up' the telephone, or why the icon for
                saving a file appears to some young people to be a vending
                machine, but things that cause difficulty for others.

                    The move was "bad for Britain" and marked Microsoft's
                    "darkest day" in its four decades of working in the country,

                    The regulator hit back saying it had to do what's best for

                    through different markets - it can't be separated for the
                    UK. So this decision blocks the deal from happening
                    globally."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If it had been approved, the $68.7bn (£55bn) deal would have
                    been the gaming industry's biggest ever takeover, and would
                    have seen Microsoft get hold of massively popular games
                    titles such as Call of Duty, Candy Crush and World of
                    Warcraft.

                    A comet-like asteroid has been flaunting a tail of material
                    as it approaches the Sun. But unlike its cometary
                    counterparts, a fresh look at asteroid Phaethon reveals,
                    this tail is made of sodium rather than dust, as was
                    previously thought.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), a joint
                    mission between NASA and the European Space Agency, recorded
                    <a
                      href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/SOHO_chases_asteroid_s_tail"
                      >new observations</a
                    >
                    of Phaethon as it passed near the Sun in May 2022. SOHO's
                    Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph imaged the
                    asteroid using different filters: one that detects dust and
                    another that detects sodium.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Phaethon's sodium tail adds even more mystery to this
                    strange object. The asteroid was discovered in 1983 and
                    named after the son of the Greek Sun god Helios for its
                    close proximity to the star. Although classified as an
                    asteroid, Phaethon has been showing some comet-like
                    behavior. The rock is the likely origin of the Geminid
                    meteor shower, which streaks across the sky in December.
                    Most meteor showers, however, are produced by comets as a
                    trail of debris left behind during their solar flyby.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The discovery of sodium in Phaethon's tail could also
                    hold clues to the origin of its meteor shower. Scientists
                    had previously thought that the asteroid's tail is what
                    crated the Geminid meteor shower, but the latest
                    observations show that the asteroid doesn't shed enough dust
                    for the shower to form. Instead, the researchers behind the
                    new study suggest that a piece of Phaethon broke off around
                    a few thousand years ago, causing the asteroid to eject a
                    stream of billions of bits that make up the Geminids.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists are set to gather more data on Phaethon through
                    an upcoming mission to the asteroid. The Japanese space
                    agency is sending the DESTINY+ mission to the celestial body
                    in 2028 in an attempt to image its surface.

                    [...] The lack of encryption means Google could in theory
                    look at the data and learn what apps and services you use,
                    which can be valuable for a number of purposes, including
                    targeted ads. "Allowing a tech giant thirsty for data like
                    Google to establish a graph of all accounts and services
                    each user has is not a good thing," Mysk said.

                  <p>
                    The issue comes as a surprise, given Google's history with
                    similar tools. Google has a vaguely similar feature that
                    lets you sync data from Google Chrome across devices. There,
                    the company gives users the option to set up a password to
                    protect that data, keeping it away from prying eyes at
                    Google and protecting it from anyone else who might
                    intercept it.

                    "2FA secrets are considered sensitive data, just like
                    passwords. Google already supports passphrases for syncing
                    Chrome data. So we expected that 2FA secrets be treated the
                    same," Mysk said.

                    [...] For some proponents of IVF automation, an even wilder
                    future awaits. By giving over conception to machines,
                    automation could speed the introduction of
                    still-controversial techniques such as genome editing, or
                    advanced methods of creating eggs from stem cells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although Munné says Overture Life has no plans to modify the
                    genetic makeup of children, he allows it would be a simple
                    matter to use the sperm-injecting robot for that purpose,
                    since it could dispense precise amounts of gene-editing
                    chemicals into an egg. "It should be very easy to add to the
                    machine," he says.

                  <p>
                    Even more speculative technology is on the horizon.
                    Fertility machines could gradually evolve into artificial
                    wombs, with children gestated in scientific centers until
                    birth. "I do believe we are going to get there," says
                    Thompson. "There is credible evidence that what we thought
                    was impossible is not so impossible."

                    Others imagine that robots could eventually be shot into
                    outer space, stocked with eggs and sperm held in a glassy
                    state of stasis. After a thousand-year journey to a distant
                    planet, such machines might boot up and create a new society
                    of humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's all part of the goal of creating more people, and not
                    just here on Earth. "There are people thinking that
                    humankind should be an interplanetary species, and human
                    lifetimes are not going to be enough to reach out to these
                    worlds," says Chavez-Badiola. "Part of the job of a
                    scientist is to keep dreaming."

                    spans domains, components and both public and private
                    organizations. As such, the solution will require a

                    stations, to the satellites, and then you've got the
                    satellites themselves," she said. "You also have space
                    innovation in the form of venture capital, and investment in
                    space. Startups get eaten up by larger companies that ...

                    The Waabi Driver is the next generation of autonomous
                    trucking technology. It can be trained as a whole, make
                    interpretable decisions, apply learned skills to unseen
                    scenarios and geographies, and adapt to any hardware
                    configuration. The Waabi Driver is a complete solution
                    designed for factory-level OEM integration, large-scale
                    commercialization, and safe deployment.

                    With prompt injection attacks, Willison said, the issue is
                    fundamentally about how large language models function.

                    of words – or you give them a sequence of tokens, which are
                    almost words – and you say, 'here's a sequence of words,
                    predict the next ones.'

                  <p>
                    "But there is no mechanism to say 'some of these words are
                    more important than others,' or 'some of these words are
                    exact instructions about what you should do and the other
                    ones are input words that you should affect with the other
                    words, but you shouldn't obey further instructions.' There
                    is no difference between the two. It's just a sequence of
                    tokens.

                    To humans, "high-quality" food might call to mind a
                    nutritious spread of fruits, veggies, and whole grains. But
                    the high-quality worm food is more like human junk food, in
                    that it packs in a lot of calories quickly.

                    that's starving goes for high fat and sugar content food,"
                    Lockery said. It's one reason why, after consuming cannabis,
                    users are more likely to reach for chocolate pudding than a
                    salad.

                    [...] The results drive home just how old the
                    endocannabinoid system is, evolutionarily speaking. Worms
                    and humans last shared a common ancestor more than 600
                    million years ago, yet cannabinoids affect our food
                    preferences in a similar way. "It's a really beautiful
                    example of what the endocannabinoid system was probably for
                    at the beginning," Lockery said.

                  <p>
                    The acquisition includes a $1.5 billion investment over
                    the next few years to upgrade TSI Semiconductors'
                    manufacturing facilities in Roseville, California. Starting
                    in 2026, the first chips will be produced on 200-millimeter

                    News of more chips being produced on U.S. soil is welcome in
                    the automotive world, one of the industries most affected by
                    the global semiconductor shortage that began with the
                    COVID-19 pandemic. The shortage started when factories shut
                    or slowed production due to lockdowns, thus disrupting
                    global supply chains. A surge in demand for electronics as
                    people stayed inside, as well as a boom in demand from an
                    automotive industry determined to go electric and build
                    smarter vehicles, only exacerbated the problem.

                    Electric vehicles on average use more chips than their
                    gas-powered counterparts, and most new EVs hitting the
                    market today promise advanced driver assistance systems and
                    high-tech infotainment systems. As a result, in 2021, the

                    SiCs, which Bosch's new factory will produce, have been a
                    hot commodity among automakers, as well. The company says
                    the market for SiCs has grown by 30% a year on average, and
                    that's in part because they offer greater range and more
                    efficient recharging for EVs. They also lose up to 50% less
                    energy, last longer and require less maintenance.

                  <p>
                    Bosch expects an average of 25 of its chips will be
                    integrated in every new vehicle by 2025.
