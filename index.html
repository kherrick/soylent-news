                    and GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards. For extra measure,
                    Gigabyte has implemented what the brand calls the "PCIe UD
                    Slot X" in some of its high-end Intel and AMD motherboards.

                    [...] While the PCIe UD Slot X feature isn't novel, this is
                    the first time we've been given a specific metric of the
                    maximum weight it can withstand. One trend we've seen is
                    that graphics cards are becoming larger and more
                    power-hungry. The transition from the

                    (Ada Lovelace) is a perfect example. Although there are
                    early whispers that the forthcoming

                    >
                    (Blackwell) likely won't be any slimmer, 128 pounds is
                    overkill.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, the initial PCB cracking was caused by the design
                    of the cutout, which didn't mitigate the weight of the
                    graphics card. So, while Gigabyte's PCIe UD Slot X supports
                    up to 128 pounds, it still won't impede PCB cracking because
                    the problem lies in the graphics card and not the expansion
                    slot. There weren't any reports of the expansion slot
                    breaking. It was always about the graphics card's warping or
                    the PCB cracking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps the 128 pounds refers to impact load, which would
                    make sense. A more sturdy expansion slot will help with
                    shipping and transportation, especially in the case of
                    pre-built machines. But then again, if the fall is high
                    enough, it won't matter if the expansion slot can
                    accommodate up to 500 pounds because the graphics card would
                    probably break. In a situation like this, many would prefer
                    that the expansion slot come off the motherboard rather than
                    fracturing the graphics card, which, in most cases, is the
                    more expensive hardware.

                    "There's scientific agreement on the science," says Jean
                    Adams, professor of dietary public health at the MRC
                    Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge. "It's how
                    to interpret that to make a policy that people aren't sure
                    of."<br />[...]<br />In 2023, PepsiCo spent millions of
                    dollars lobbying the US government. According to one
                    disclosure from last July, the Doritos and Tostitos maker
                    spent $1.27 million on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
                    Program (SNAP) purchasing restrictions, the upcoming dietary
                    guidelines, sweeteners, and food labeling, among other
                    issues.

                    Where legislation is passed that has a direct impact on food
                    multinationals, they have often fought back in the courts.
                    In Mexico, companies including Kellogg's and Nestlé have
                    sued the government over the introduction of
                    front-of-package warning labels and other restrictions
                    including the use of children's characters in marketing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The labels—black octagons that warn about excess of sugars,
                    sodium, trans fat, saturated fat, and calories in
                    products—were rolled out in 2020. A handful of the lawsuits
                    were accepted by the Mexican Supreme Court and are still
                    being fought.

                  <p>
                    Nestlé said it "supported front-of-pack labeling that helps
                    consumers make informed choices" including
                    government-endorsed labels such as Nutri-Score in some
                    European countries or the traffic light system in the UK.

                    have gained new insight on galaxies forming during an
                    earlier period of the universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These three galaxies are believed to be actively forming
                    when the universe was only 400m to 600m years old – compared
                    to the universe’s current estimated age of roughly 13.7bn
                    years. Thanks to Webb’s powerful instruments, researchers
                    can peer into this early period and learn more about how the
                    universe was formed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Webb’s data on this early period shows these three galaxies
                    are surrounded by gases. The researchers suspect these gases
                    are almost purely hydrogen and helium, the earliest elements
                    to exist in the cosmos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “We’re moving away from a picture of galaxies as
                    isolated ecosystems,” Nielsen said. “At this stage in the
                    history of the universe, galaxies are all intimately
                    connected to the intergalactic medium with its filaments and
                    structures of pristine gas.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] By combining spectra with Webb images, the team found
                    that the light from these three forming galaxies is being
                    absorbed by large amounts of neutral hydrogen gas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The gas must be very widespread and cover a very large
                    fraction of the galaxy,” said study co-author and associate
                    professor Darach Watson. “This suggests that we are seeing
                    the assembly of neutral hydrogen gas into galaxies. That gas
                    will go on to cool, clump, and form new stars.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By matching James Webb’s data to existing models of star
                    formation, the researchers also found that these galaxies
                    primarily have populations of young stars, suggesting these
                    galaxies have not had enough time to form most of their
                    stars yet.

                    Nvidia's argument likely depends on the court agreeing that
                    AI models ingesting published works in order to transform
                    those works into weights governing AI outputs is fair use.

                    Some companies, like OpenAI, have already started licensing

                    license content from News Corp. "supports the contention"
                    that "publishers should be paid when their work is used for
                    AI," MediaPost

                    Until this question is settled by courts or lawmakers,
                    companies training AI on the Books3 dataset will likely
                    continue to face lawsuits from rights holders, particularly
                    from those who see AI models as an extension of harms caused
                    by these allegedly illegal shadow libraries. A lawyer for

                    is no question" that Libgen's conduct is "massively
                    illegal."

                  <p>
                    Authors suing Nvidia have taken the next step, linking the
                    chipmaker to shadow libraries by arguing that "these shadow
                    libraries have long been of interest to the AI-training
                    community because they host and distribute vast quantities
                    of unlicensed copyrighted material. For that reason, these
                    shadow libraries also violate the US Copyright Act."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Nvidia apparently prepares to defend against copyright
                    suits by disputing what a shadow library even is, the
                    websites at the heart of Nvidia's suits may take less issue
                    with the label. Anna, the pseudonymous creator of Anna's
                    Archive, freely uses the term,
                    <a href="https://annas-blog.org/">describing</a> the site as
                    "the world's largest shadow library" while offering to train
                    other so-called pirate archivists.

                    After years of promising legislation against Big Tech firms

                    However, also in 2023, the finally active Digital Markets
                    Unit (DMU) did get going with a Digital Markets, Competition
                    and Consumers Bill. While its stated purpose is to lead to
                    establishing codes of conduct for Big Tech firms, it's a
                    step toward emulating the existing Digital Markets Act in
                    the EU.

                  <p>
                    The bill was, though, just one of very many legislative
                    bills making their way through the UK parliamentary system —
                    until this week. On May 22, 2024, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak
                    called for a General Election, and that immediately changed
                    proceedings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Bills cannot be carried over from one Parliament to
                    another, so the UK has been picking which it will rush
                    through, and which it will abandon. Consequently, on May 23,
                    Parliament debated and passed the bill.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We believe overall that this is a good Bill that
                    takes the first steps to regulating the behaviour of the big
                    tech companies, which is long overdue," said Baroness Jones
                    of Whitchurch (Labour).

                    Four zebrafish are alive and well after nearly a month in
                    space aboard China's Tiangong space station. As part of an
                    experiment testing the development of vertebrates in
                    microgravity, the fish live and swim within a small habitat
                    aboard the station.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the zebrafish have thus far survived, they are showing
                    some signs of disorientation. The taikonauts aboard
                    Tiangong—Ye Guangfu, Li Cong, and Li Guangsu—have reported
                    instances of swimming upside down, backward, and in circular
                    motions, suggesting that microgravity is having an effect on
                    their spatial awareness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The zebrafish were launched aboard Shenzhou-18, which
                    carried them, as well as a batch of hornwort, to orbit on
                    April 25, 2024. The aim of the project is to create a
                    self-sustaining ecosystem, studying the effects of both
                    microgravity and radiation on the development and growth of
                    these species.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The zebrafish genome has been fully sequenced, and for
                    these reasons zebrafish are commonly used in scientific
                    experiments on Earth. Seeing how these well-studied
                    creatures behave in such an extreme environment may have a
                    lot to tell us about the life and development of vertebrates
                    across species while exposed to microgravity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This is not the first time fish have been to space.
                    Starting in 2012, a Japanese research project brought medaka
                    and zebrafish to the International Space Station for study
                    in a similar aquatic habitat. The results of those studies
                    revealed a decrease in bone density in the fish within just
                    ten days. Human astronauts experience similar effects in
                    orbit, though not on such quick time scales, and they can be
                    mitigated somewhat through rigorous exercise routines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The health and sustainability of animal life in space
                    is a key area of research for human spaceflight efforts. If
                    humans are to travel on long-term space missions, like those
                    required to reach Mars, then understanding the biological
                    implications of space travel is vital. These zebrafish are
                    the latest in a long line of experiments undertaken in this
                    pressing area of research.

                    But one of these Russian satellites, Kosmos 2542, released a
                    smaller sub-satellite, designated Kosmos 2543, which made
                    its own passes near the USA 245 spacecraft, a KH-11 imaging
                    satellite similar to USA 314. At one point, satellite
                    trackers noticed USA 245 made a slight change to orbit. Its
                    Russian pursuer later made a similar orbit adjustment to
                    keep up.

                  <p>
                    In 2020, Kosmos 2543 backed off from USA 245. Once well away
                    from the NRO satellite, Kosmos 2543 ejected a mysterious
                    projectile into space at a speed fast enough to damage any
                    target in its sights.

                    weapon." The projectile fired from Kosmos 2543 at a relative
                    velocity of some 400 mph (700 km per hour), according to
                    McDowell's analysis of publicly available satellite tracking

                    Charles "CQ" Brown, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,
                    in an event Wednesday hosted by the Atlantic Council. "We
                    looked at it as a very benign environment, where you didn't
                    have to worry about conflicts in space. As a matter of fact,
                    naming space as a warfighting domain was kind of forbidden,
                    but that's changed, and it's been changed based what our

                    The dent got his attention the most. He ran his finger
                    across this damaged area to see if it was indeed a dent or
                    perhaps some kind of residue. As he was rubbing the damaged
                    area of the panel, he felt a sudden sharp pain and jerked
                    his hand away. Due to the angle of his arm, he apparently
                    slit his wrist open on the extremely sharp corner where the
                    side panels and the tailgate meet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Initially, he thought this was just a superficial cut. So
                    did the Tesla employees who joked, "This thing can be
                    dangerous!" Then they noticed the blood pooling on the
                    ground below him. The service team rushed to get a first aid
                    kit, with which they disinfected and bandaged his wound.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite this rather disastrous delivery, bdesign did
                    finalize the paperwork and take the truck home. But by the
                    end of the day, his wound still hadn't begun to close. So he
                    spent the evening in the emergency room.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunately, 'bdesign' isn't the first owner to get a gash
                    from the Cybertruck. Earlier this month, another owner
                    <a

                      >cut themselves on the door's edge</a
                    > when exiting the vehicle. Of course, this type of door
                    injury is not unheard of. For instance, a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.chevybolt.org/threads/drivers-door-stabs-me.51537/"

                    >
                    to them on more than one occasion. A Rivian owner injured
                    themselves in a similar manner,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/wetisl/my_rivian_broke_me/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace"

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the unusually sharp corners of the Cybertruck's exterior
                    and could prove dangerous to both owners and pedestrians.
                    This is a concern that automotive reviewers, safety
                    experts and owners have been pointing out for months. We
                    even saw this as far back as December, when
                    <a
                      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6WDq0V5oBg&amp;t=1194s"
                      >reviewer Jason Cammisa ripped his shirt and cut his

                    on the edge of the vehicle's hood.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So this is not a one-off occurrence. Hopefully, it will not
                    become more common as more trucks hit the streets, and we
                    hope 'bdesign' has an easier time with his truck from now
                    on.

                    Silica glass, known for its brittleness, weight, and
                    non-biodegradable nature, faces challenges in finding
                    suitable alternatives.

                    Transparent wood, made by infusing polymers into wood, shows
                    promise but is hindered by limited availability of wood in
                    China and fire risks associated with its use. This study
                    explores the potential of utilizing bamboo, which has a
                    shorter growth cycle, as a valuable resource for developing
                    flame-retardant, smoke-suppressing, and superhydrophobic
                    transparent bamboo. A 3-layered flame-retardant barrier,
                    composed of a top silane layer, an intermediate layer of
                    SiO2 formed through hydrolysis-condensation of Na2SiO3 on
                    the surface, and an inner layer of Na2SiO3, has been
                    confirmed to be effective in reducing heat release, slowing
                    flame spread, and inhibiting the release of combustible
                    volatiles, toxic smoke, and CO.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Compared to natural bamboo and other congeneric transparent
                    products, the transparent bamboo displays remarkable
                    superiority, with the majority of parameters being notably
                    lower by an entire order of magnitude.

                    It achieves a long ignition time of 116 s, low total heat
                    release (0.7 MJ/m2), low total smoke production (0.063 m2),
                    and low peak CO concentration (0.008 kg/kg). Moreover, when
                    used as a substrate for perovskite solar cells, the
                    transparent bamboo displays the potential to act as a light
                    management layer, leading to a marked efficiency enhancement
                    of 15.29%. The excellent features of transparent bamboo make
                    it an enticing choice for future advancements in
                    flame-retardant glasses and optical devices.

                    Bamboo, often referred to as "the second forest", boasts a
                    rapid growth and regeneration rate, allowing it to reach
                    maturity and be utilized as a building material within 4 to
                    7 years of growth. With an output 4 times higher than wood
                    per acre, bamboo is recognized for its exceptional
                    efficiency. In terms of chemical composition, bamboo shares
                    similarities with wood, mainly consisting of lignin,
                    cellulose, and hemicellulose. Furthermore, the internal
                    hierarchical structure of bamboo closely resembles that of
                    wood, featuring high porosity and permeability because of
                    neatly arranged vertical channels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This characteristic suggests the potential use of bamboo in
                    the production of transparent composite materials.
                    Transparent bamboo offers 3 distinct advantages over
                    traditional silica glass. Firstly, the abundant and
                    renewable nature of bamboo feedstock aligns with
                    environmental sustainability goals. Secondly, transparent
                    bamboo exhibits high light transmittance and haze, enabling
                    privacy while facilitating the entry of natural light
                    indoors. Lastly, the low density and excellent ability to
                    regulate temperature and humidity from a bamboo template
                    further position it as a promising alternative to
                    conventional glass.

                    The competition to produce the world's most advanced chips
                    is fierce, and TSMC's product roadmap promises that the
                    battle for supremacy will be intense. First, its
                    performance-optimized N3P node is coming, set to enter mass
                    production in the second half of 2024 and will be the
                    company's most advanced node for a while.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next year, however, TSMC will introduce two production nodes
                    that will enter high-volume manufacturing in the second half
                    of 2025, promising to accelerate the advantages of N3P.
                    These nodes are N3X, a 3nm-class process, and N2, a
                    2nm-class process.

                    compiled by AnandTech, N3X chips can either reduce power
                    consumption by 7% by lowering Vdd from 1.0V to 0.9V,
                    increase performance by 5%, or increase transistor density
                    by around 10%.

                    stacked nanosheets deliver a new level of energy efficient
                    computing for HPC, TSMC says. Backside power rail will also
                    be added to boost performance even further.

                  <p>
                    N2 technology will come with TSMC NanoFlex, a
                    design-technology co-optimization that provides designers
                    with flexibility in N2 standard cells, with short cells
                    emphasizing small area and greater power efficiency, and
                    tall cells maximizing performance. Customers are able to
                    optimize the combination of short and tall cells within the
                    same design block.

                  <p>
                    In 2026, TSMC will introduce two more nodes: N2P (2nm-class)
                    and A16 (1.6nm-class).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    N2P is expected to deliver a 5% - 10% lower power or a 5% -
                    10% higher performance compared to the original N2. However,
                    contrary to prior announcements, N2P

                    particularly ones whose uses owe a debt to traditional
                    knowledge.

                  <p>
                    After lengthy negotiations, delegates approved to cheers and
                    applause the "first WIPO Treaty to address the interface
                    between intellectual property, genetic resources and
                    traditional knowledge", the UN's World Intellectual Property
                    Organization said in a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Genetic resources are increasingly used by companies
                    in everything from cosmetics to seeds, medicines,
                    biotechnology and food supplements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They have enabled considerable progress in health, climate
                    and food security, according to the United Nations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The treaty text says patent applicants will be
                    required to disclose where the genetic resources used in an
                    invention came from, and the indigenous people who provided
                    the associated traditional knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The goal is to combat biopiracy by ensuring that an
                    invention is genuinely new, and that the countries and local
                    communities concerned agree with the use of their genetic
                    resources, such as plant species cultivated over time, and
                    the traditional knowledge surrounding them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While natural genetic resources—such as those found in
                    medicinal plants, agricultural crops and animal
                    breeds—cannot be directly protected as intellectual
                    property, inventions developed using them can be patented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As it is currently not mandatory to publish the origin of
                    innovations, many developing countries are concerned that
                    patents are being granted that circumvent the rights of
                    indigenous people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Antony Scott Taubman set up WIPO's traditional knowledge
                    division in 2001 but no longer works with the agency.

                  <p>
                    "I wouldn't go so far as to say it's revolutionary," he said
                    of the treaty.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Conceptually what we're looking at here is a recognition
                    that when I apply for a patent, it's not purely a technical
                    step... it recognizes that I have liabilities," he told AFP.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Brazilian ambassador Guilherme de Aguiar Patriota, who has
                    chaired the talks, hailed the new treaty early Friday as a
                    "very carefully balanced outcome" of the talks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It constitutes the best possible compromise and a carefully
                    calibrated solution, which seeks to bridge and to balance a
                    variety of interests, some very passionately held and
                    assiduously expressed and defended over the course of
                    decades."

                    [...] It took years of negotiations to reduce 5,000 pages of
                    documentation on the subject down to the agreement.

                    PBMD (Plant-Based Meat Diet) on cardiometabolic health

                    actor persistent access to infected devices. The malicious
                    download, planted inside an executable file that installs

                    on X (formerly Twitter) reported it. It’s unclear when the
                    backdoored version was removed from the company’s download
                    page. JAVS representatives didn’t immediately respond to

                    The installer file was titled JAVS Viewer Setup
                    8.3.7.250-1.exe. When executed, it copied the binary file
                    fffmpeg.exe to the file path C:\Program Files
                    (x86)\JAVS\Viewer 8\. To bypass security warnings, the
                    installer was digitally signed, but with a signature issued
                    to an entity called “Vanguard Tech Limited” rather than to
                    “Justice AV Solutions Inc.,” the signing entity used to

                    A five-year-old boy who was born without a left hand has
                    become the youngest in the world to get a bionic Hero Arm,
                    making him "feel like a superhero".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The custom-made, 3D printed prosthetic is produced by
                    Bristol-based Open Bionics, which was founded in 2014 and
                    launched four clinics in America in the last year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jordan, of Long Island, New York state, is now the youngest
                    ever owner of one of the firm's Hero Arms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The prosthetic uses special sensors which detect muscular
                    contractions and turn them into bionic hand movements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most children with Hero Arms are aged seven years old or
                    above, but the firm said Jordan's size for his age and his
                    high IQ – meaning he was easy to teach how to use the Hero
                    Arm – meant he could have one sooner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Open Bionics describes itself as the only company in
                    the world making multi-articulating hands small and light
                    enough for children as young as Jordan.

                    Both generative and operational AI "generate new work,"
                    Cappelli pointed out. "People have to manage databases, they
                    have to organize materials, they have to resolve these
                    problems of dueling reports, validity, and those sorts of
                    things. It's going to generate a lot of new tasks, somebody
                    is going to have to do those."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said operational AI that's been in place for some time is
                    still a work in progress. "Machine learning with numbers has
                    been markedly underused. Some part of this has been database
                    management questions. It takes a lot of effort just to put
                    the data together so you can analyze it. Data is often in
                    different silos in different organizations, which are
                    politically difficult and just technically difficult to put
                    together."  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cappelli cites several issues in the move toward generative
                    AI and LLMs that must be overcome:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cappelli suggested the most useful generative AI application
                    in the near term is sifting through data stores and
                    delivering analysis to support decision-making processes.
                    "We are washing data right now that we haven't been able to
                    analyze ourselves," he said. "It's going to be way better at
                    doing that than we are," he said. Along with database
                    management, "somebody's got to worry about guardrails and
                    data pollution issues."

                    "Like the papillae on a lotus leaf, micropillars do more
                    than decorate the surface," said Cheng. "They give the
                    surface new properties."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The micropillars designed by Cheng's team are 0.08
                    millimeters tall, roughly the same as the width of a human
                    hair. They are arranged in a regular pattern of 0.12
                    millimeters apart. A droplet of water encompasses 100 or
                    more of them. These tiny pillars press into a water droplet,
                    releasing heat into the interior of the droplet and making
                    it boil more quickly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Compared to the traditional view that the Leidenfrost effect
                    triggers at 230 degrees Celsius, the fin-array-like
                    micropillars press more heat into the water than a flat
                    surface. This causes microdroplets to levitate and jump off
                    the surface within milliseconds at lower temperatures
                    because the speed of boiling can be controlled by changing
                    the height of the pillars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the textured surface was heated, the team discovered
                    that the temperature at which the floating effect was
                    achieved was significantly lower than that of a flat
                    surface, starting at 130 degrees Celsius.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not only is this a novel discovery for the understanding of
                    the Leidenfrost effect, it is a twist on the limits
                    previously imagined. A
                    <a
                      href="https://phys.org/news/2021-09-unveils-minimum-temperature-droplets-levitating.html"
                      >2021 study</a
                    >
                    from Emory University found that the properties of water
                    actually caused the Leidenfrost effect to fail when the
                    temperature of the heated surface lowers to 140 degrees.
                    Using the micropillars created by Cheng's team, the effect
                    is sustainable even 10 degrees below that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We thought the micropillars would change the behaviors of
                    this well-known phenomenon, but our results defied even our
                    own imaginations," said Cheng. "The observed bubble-droplet
                    interactions are a big discovery for boiling heat transfer."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Leidenfrost effect is more than an intriguing phenomenon
                    to watch, it is also a critical point in heat transfer. When
                    water boils, it is most efficiently removing heat from a
                    surface. In applications such as machine cooling, this means
                    that adapting a hot surface to the textured approach
                    presented by Cheng's team gets heat out more quickly,
                    lowering the possibility of damage caused when a machine
                    gets too hot.

                    "Our research can prevent disasters such as vapor
                    explosions, which pose significant threats to industrial
                    heat transfer equipment," said Huang. "Vapor explosions
                    occur when vapor bubbles within a liquid rapidly expand due
                    to the present of intense heat source nearby. One example of
                    where this risk is particularly pertinent is in nuclear
                    plants, where the surface structure of heat exchangers can
                    influence vapor bubble growth and potentially trigger such
                    explosions. Through our theoretical exploration in the
                    paper, we investigate how surface structure affects the
                    growth mode of vapor bubbles, providing valuable insights
                    into controlling and mitigating the risk of vapor
                    explosions."

                Another day and Elon wants to do something new. Now he is going
                to build the worlds largest supercomputer, ready next fall
                (2025). His AI company is going to be the main customer, but I
                guess his other ventures from cars to rockets could use some
                computational power to.
              </p>
              <p>
                So he is apparently just not going to be bigger then the rest.
                He is going to build it massively bigger. As in at least four
                times bigger then then the top computers today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Renting supercomputing powers from other companies have
                apparently now become so expensive that it's cheaper and better
                to just build your own. A Gigafactory of Compute.
              </p>
              <p>
                The previous one for Tesla, the Tesla Dojo, was apparently not
                enough.

                    [...] The planned supercomputer would be "at least four
                    times the size of the biggest GPU clusters that exist
                    today," such as those used by Meta Platforms Inc to train
                    its AI models, Musk was quoted as saying during a
                    presentation to investors this month.

                    Since OpenAI's generative AI tool ChatGPT exploded on the
                    scene in 2022, the technology has been an area of fierce
                    competition between tech giants Microsoft Corp and Google
                    Inc, as well as Meta and start-ups like Anthropic and
                    Stability AI Inc.

                  <p>
                    Musk is one of the world's few investors with deep enough
                    pockets to compete with OpenAI, Google or Meta on AI.

                    His company xAI is developing a chatbot named Grok, which
                    can access social media platform X, also owned by Musk, in
                    real time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Earlier this year, Musk said training the Grok 2 model took
                    about 20,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, adding that the Grok 3 model
                    and beyond would require 100,000 Nvidia H100 units.

                    In related news, Tesla shareholders are being urged by a
                    major proxy advisory firm to reject a proposed US$56 billion
                    pay package for Musk, in a blow to the electric-vehicle
                    manufacturer's board.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Glass Lewis &amp; Co made its recommendation in a report
                    released on Saturday, citing the "excessive size" of the pay
                    deal and the dilutive effect upon exercise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Mr. Musk's slate of extraordinarily time-consuming projects
                    unrelated to the company was well-documented before the 2018
                    grant, and only expanded with his high-profile purchase of
                    the company now known as X," Glass Lewis said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The recommendation to large institutional investors might
                    sway their vote over Musk's pay at the vehicle
                    manufacturer's annual meeting on June 13. If the proposal is
                    rejected, the CEO might make good on threats to develop
                    products outside of Tesla.

                    And, I mean, when compared to link taxes, it is potentially
                    marginally better (but also, with some very scary potential
                    side effects). The always thoughtful Brandon Silverman (who
                    created CrowdTangle and has worked to increase transparency
                    from tech companies) also endorses the bill as “<a
                      href="https://brandonsilverman.substack.com/p/a-potential-path-forward-between"
                      >a potential path forward</a
                    >.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But I tend to agree much more with journalism professor Jeff
                    Jarvis who highlights
                    <a
                      href="https://medium.com/whither-news/news-legislation-from-bad-to-worse-c32d9fc34670"

                    >
                    and the framework it creates. As I’ve pointed out with link
                    taxes, the oft-ignored point of a tax on something is to get
                    less of it. You tax something bad because that tax decreases
                    how much of it is out there. And, as Jarvis points out here,
                    this is basically a tax on information:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, Jarvis rightly points out that Glazer’s bill is
                    positioned as something unique when users give their
                    attention to internet companies, but explicitly carves out
                    when users give their attention to other types of media
                    companies. This sets up a problematically tiered system for
                    when attention gets taxed and when it doesn’t:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Indeed, the entire framing of the bill seems to suggest that
                    data and advertising is a sort of “pollution,” that needs to
                    be taxed in order to minimize it. And that seems
                    particularly troublesome.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As Jarvis also notes, the true beneficiaries of a law like
                    this would still be those rapacious hedge funds that have
                    bought up a bunch of news orgs [...]

                  <p>
                    The method, which the researchers say is "an absolute
                    miracle," <sub>[are we taken as savages here?]</sub> uses
                    the electrically-powered arc furnaces used for steel
                    recycling to simultaneously recycle cement, the
                    carbon-hungry component of concrete.<br />...<br />The
                    Cambridge researchers found that used cement is an effective
                    substitute for lime flux, which is used in steel recycling
                    to remove impurities and normally ends up as a waste product
                    known as slag. But by replacing lime with used cement, the
                    end product is recycled cement that can be used to make new
                    concrete.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cement recycling method developed by the Cambridge
                    researchers, reported in the journal Nature, does not add
                    any significant costs to concrete or steel production and
                    significantly reduces emissions from both concrete and
                    steel, due to the reduced need for lime flux.<br />...<br />Recent
                    tests carried out by the Materials Processing Institute, a
                    partner in the project, showed that recycled cement can be
                    produced at scale in an electric arc furnace (EAF), the
                    first time this has been achieved. Eventually, this method
                    could produce zero emission cement, if the EAF was powered
                    by renewable energy.<br />...<br />"I had a vague idea from
                    previous work that if it were possible to crush old
                    concrete, taking out the sand and stones, heating the cement
                    would remove the water, and then it would form clinker
                    again," said first author Dr Cyrille Dunant, also from the
                    Department of Engineering. "A bath of liquid metal would
                    help this chemical reaction along, and an electric arc
                    furnace, used to recycle steel, felt like a strong
                    possibility. We had to try."<br />...<br />"We found the
                    combination of cement clinker and iron oxide is an excellent
                    steelmaking slag because it foams and it flows well," said
                    Dunant. "And if you get the balance right and cool the slag
                    quickly enough, you end up with reactivated cement, without
                    adding any cost to the steelmaking process."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cement made through this recycling process contains
                    higher levels of iron oxide than conventional cement, but
                    the researchers say this has little effect on performance.

                Several sites are reporting on Qualcomm's increasing Linux
                support. The tide is turning and the Microsoft monopoly on OEMs,
                at least the non-x86 ones, might be weakening as full Linux
                support is now expected on the modern hardware architectures
                these days:

                    Here's the thing. In the Linux world, ARM has had something
                    like a 15-year head start over Microsoft's own often anemic
                    ARM efforts, thanks to the Raspberry Pi and single-board
                    computers making the platform a good choice for more than
                    just basic web-surfers.

                    far from done, as there's still a lot of development work
                    needed to get the X Elite into a fully operational state in

                    Qualcomm prides itself on its Linux enablement work and has
                    prioritized Linux enablement in all of its previous
                    Snapdragon laptop CPUs, typically announcing Linux support
                    one or two days after launch. The Snapdragon X Elite
                    continues that pattern, with Linux enablement being
                    announced the very next day after its original October 23,
                    2023 debut.

                It seems that the Asahi Linux project has also done great work
                on the M-series chips despite Apple. There, Apple still has to
                get up to speed.

                    The Minnesota omnibus bill also changed a law that let
                    municipalities build broadband networks, but only if no
                    private providers offer service or will offer service "in
                    the reasonably foreseeable future." That restriction had

                    The caveat that prevented municipalities from competing

                Soylentils? Do you have municipal broadband? Does your ISP have

                    [...] President Yoon raised many solid points. The United
                    States and European Union have thrown tens of billions of
                    dollars and euros respectively at IC manufacturers, while
                    South Korea's chip champs – Samsung Electronics and SK hynix
                    – are indeed monsters of memory as they collectively hold
                    over 70 percent of the market for DRAM and NAND flash. But
                    beyond Samsung's modest Exynos SoC operation (which can't
                    even satisfy demand for its own Galaxy smartphones), South
                    Korea is not home to a notable manufacturer of high-value
                    processors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Samsung and SK hynix have also made enormous bets on
                    factories to produce more memory – some on the peninsula and
                    others stateside (where they could attract funds from Uncle
                    Sam).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    South Korea's new funding package is tiny compared to the
                    sums its chip champions are spending, so it's unlikely it
                    will divert their efforts notably. Nor will it deter them
                    continuing to target the so-hot-right-now memory market, in
                    which demand for DDR5 and related variants – plus high
                    bandwidth memory (HBM) – is currently rampant. Indeed, SK
                    hynix has already found buyers for all the HBM it can make
                    in 2024 and most of the chips it will produce in 2025.

                    Six family members caught a rare parasitic worm infection
                    after sharing a meal that included black bear meat, which
                    was initially served rare after being stored frozen for more
                    than a month.

                    Two of the people reported only eating vegetables at the
                    meal, so it's likely that the infected meat contaminated
                    these sides at some point.

                    published Thursday (May 23) by the Centers for Disease
                    Control and Prevention (CDC). Between 2016 and 2022, only 35
                    probable and confirmed cases of the disease were recorded.

                    meat was the suspected or confirmed source of infection in

                    Trichinellosis occurs when people inadvertently consume
                    larvae of a roundworm in the <em>Trichinella</em> genus. The
                    worm commonly infects bears, wild boars, wildcats, foxes,
                    wolves, seals and walruses. People typically become infected
                    after consuming raw or undercooked meat from infected
                    animals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Historically, people in the U.S. sometimes contracted the
                    infection from raw or undercooked commercial pork products,
                    but modern regulations and cooking guidelines have lowered
                    this risk.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The newly reported case took place in 2022, when a
                    29-year-old man in Minnesota was hospitalized with a fever,
                    severe muscle aches and pains and swelling around the eyes.
                    He was also found to have a high number of immune cells
                    called eosinophilia, a sign of infection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Within a span of about half a month, the man had sought
                    medical attention for his symptoms four times and was
                    hospitalized twice. During the second hospitalization, he
                    reported having consumed bear meat, and the medical team
                    started him on medication for parasitic worms, just in case.
                    They later confirmed he was carrying antibodies against
                    <em>Trichinella</em> worms, and an investigation was
                    launched to check for more cases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    About a week before he got sick, the Minnesota man had met
                    up with nine family members in South Dakota. They'd shared a
                    meal that included kabobs made with black bear (<em
                      >Ursus americanus</em
                    >) meat, which was originally harvested in Canada by one of
                    the attending family members. It had been frozen for 45 days
                    before being thawed, cooked and served with vegetables.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The hunting outfitter had recommended freezing the meat to
                    kill parasites," the CDC report notes. But some
                    <em>Trichinella</em> species can survive being frozen. (This
                    includes <em>Trichinella</em><em>nativa</em>, which turned
                    out to be the species likely involved in this case.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The meat was initially inadvertently served rare,
                    reportedly because the meat was dark in color, and it was
                    difficult for the family members to visually ascertain the
                    level of doneness," the report noted. Some family members
                    noticed the meat was underdone while eating it, and it was
                    then cooked a bit more before being served again.

                    Proteins linked to cancer can start appearing in people's
                    blood more than seven years before they're diagnosed, our
                    funded researchers have found. In the future, it's possible
                    doctors could use these early warning signs to find and
                    treat cancer much earlier than they're able to today.

                  <p>
                    Across two studies, researchers at
                    <a href="https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/"
                      >Oxford Population Health</a
                    >
                    identified 618 proteins linked to 19 different types of
                    cancer, including 107 proteins in a group of people whose
                    blood was collected at least seven years before they were
                    diagnosed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings suggest that these proteins could be involved
                    at the very earliest stages of cancer. Intercepting them
                    could give us a way to stop the disease developing
                    altogether.

                    "This research brings us closer to being able to prevent
                    cancer with targeted drugs – once thought impossible but now
                    much more attainable," explained Dr Karl Smith-Byrne, Senior
                    Molecular Epidemiologist at Oxford Population Health, who
                    worked on both papers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For now, though, we need to do further research. The team
                    want to find out more about the roles these proteins play in
                    cancer development, how we can use tests to spot the most
                    important ones, and which drugs we can use to stop them
                    driving cancer.

                      >first study</a

                    stored by UK Biobank, including over 4,900 samples from

                    Their analysis of 1,463 proteins in each sample revealed 107
                    that changed at least seven years before a cancer diagnosis
                    and 182 that changed at least three years before a cancer
                    diagnosis.

                    cancer cases to do a deep dive into which blood proteins
                    were involved in cancer development and could be targeted by
                    new treatments.

                  <p>
                    This time, they found 40 proteins in the blood that
                    influence someone's risk of getting nine different types of
                    cancer. While altering these proteins may increase or
                    decrease the chances of someone developing cancer, more
                    research is needed to make sure targeting them with drugs
                    doesn't cause unintended side effects.

                The BBC is running a podcast on "Archive on 4" called "Turning

                I remember greatly enjoying that book in the 1970s, made a real
                impression and it changed how I thought about certain things.
                This podcast was a great refresher. It even includes original
                interviews with Robert Persig (the author) and others close to
                the creation of the book.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the backstory behind the book was eye opening (but other
                parts were easy enough to work out just by reading it). For
                example, Persig flogged his original manuscript to many, many
                publishers before he got a nibble. Then he gives a lot of credit
                to a young editor who convinced him to change from (iirc) first
                to third person (via an unmamed observer) -- resulting in the
                eventual great success of the book.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, the podcast can't resist revisiting the oft-quoted
                beer can shim story...or am I confusing that with a recent post
                on a motorcycle maintenance forum (grin)?

                    The EU is concerned that Bing’s AI features could impact
                    elections, while the UK’s CMA has decided not to investigate
                    Microsoft’s partnership with Mistral AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The EU has Microsoft on its regulatory radar, as it has sent
                    the company a legally binding request for information about
                    Bing’s generative AI features.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The European Commission said this request for information is
                    based on suspicions that Bing may have breached the
                    <a

                    >
                    (DSA) due to risks linked to generative AI. These risks
                    include AI ‘hallucinations’, the viral spread of deepfakes
                    and the “automated manipulation of services that can mislead
                    voters”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Meanwhile, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority
                    (CMA) has opted to not investigate Microsoft’s partnership
                    with the start-up Mistral AI.

                    earlier this year as part of a “<a

                      >multi-year partnership</a
                    >” to boost its Azure cloud computing platform with AI. But
                    the CMA had concerns around whether the agreements between
                    the two companies qualified as a merger deal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As part of that effort, the CMA looked into the minority
                    investment deals agreed by Microsoft and Mistral. The
                    regulator had concerns that the links between the two
                    companies could impact competition within the UK.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But in a brief statement released today (17 May), the CMA
                    decided that Microsoft’s partnership with Mistral AI “does
                    not qualify for investigation” under the merger provisions
                    in the UK.

                    The wreckage of a US Navy submarine that sank the most
                    Japanese warships during World War Two has been found in the
                    South China Sea, some 80 years after it was sunk by enemy
                    forces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The USS Harder was found 3,000ft (914m) below water off the
                    Philippines' northern island of Luzon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Harder was sunk in battle on 29 August 1944, along with
                    its crew of 79 men.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In one of its final war patrols, it sank three Japanese
                    destroyers and heavily damaged two others over four days,
                    according to the US Navy's History and Heritage Command
                    (NHHC).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This forced the Japanese to change their battle plans and
                    delay their carrier force, contributing to their defeat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Harder was lost in the course of victory. We must not
                    forget that victory has a price, as does freedom," said
                    Samuel J. Cox, a retired US admiral who heads the NHHC.

                  <p>
                    The Philippines was one of the main Pacific battlegrounds of
                    World War Two, as the US fought to retake its former colony
                    from the Japanese Imperial Army.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Waters in and around the archipelago have served as the
                    resting place of famed World War Two battleships.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Harder, which sailed under the motto of "Hit 'em
                    harder', was found by the Lost 52 project, which aims to
                    find the 52 US submarines lost during World War Two. It was
                    found sitting upright on its keel or spine, and relatively
                    intact, the US Navy said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The submarine and its crew were later awarded the
                    Presidential Unit Citation for its service during the war.
                    The honour recognises extraordinary heroism in action.

                , Microsoft is introducing a new "feature" in Windows 11:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    If you haven't read about it yet, Recall is an AI feature
                    coming to Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs. It's designed to let you
                    go back in time on your computer by "taking images of your
                    active screen every few seconds" and analyzing them with AI,
                    according to Microsoft's Recall FAQs. If anyone other than
                    you gets access to that Recall data, it could be disastrous.
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    On the surface, this sounds like a cool feature, but that
                    paranoid privacy purist in the back of my mind is burying
                    his face in a pillow and screaming. Imagine if almost
                    everything you had done for the past three months was
                    recorded for anyone with access to your computer to see.
                    Well, if you use Recall, you won't have to imagine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That might seem like an overreaction, but let me explain:
                    Recall is taking screenshots every few seconds and storing
                    them on your device. Adding encryption into the mix, that's
                    an enormous amount of bloaty visual data that will show
                    almost everything you've been doing on your computer during
                    that period.
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Microsoft openly
                    admits that Recall will be taking screenshots of your
                    passwords and private data:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Note that Recall does not perform content moderation. It
                    will not hide information such as passwords or financial
                    account numbers. That data may be in snapshots that are
                    stored on your device, especially when sites do not follow
                    standard internet protocols like cloaking password entry."
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    Arguably, the worst part about this is that it will be on by
                    default once you activate your device. Microsoft states:
                  </p>
                  <p>        On by default</p>
                </div>

                    collaborations with third parties. In particular, the
                    company said it would launch its all-new 256-core AmpereOne
                    processor next year, made on TSMC's N3 process technology.
                    Also, Ampere is teaming up with Qualcomm to build AI
                    inference servers with the company's accelerators.
                    Apparently, Huawei is also looking at integrating
                    third-party UCIe-compatible chiplets into its own platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ampere has begun shipping 192-core AmpereOne processors with
                    an eight-channel DDR5 memory subsystem it introduced a year
                    ago. Later this year, the company plans to introduce
                    192-core AmpereOne CPUs with a 12-channel DDR5 memory
                    subsystem, requiring a brand-new platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next year, the company will use this platform for its
                    256-core AmpereOne CPU, which will be made using one of
                    TSMC's N3 fabrication processes. The company does not
                    disclose whether the new processor will also feature a new
                    microarchitecture, though it looks like it will continue to
                    feature 2 MB of L2 cache per core.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are extending our product family to include a new
                    256-core product that delivers 40% more performance than any
                    other CPU in the market," said Renee James, chief executive
                    of Ampere. "It is not just about cores. It is about what you
                    can do with the platform. We have several new features that
                    enable efficient performance, memory, caching, and AI
                    compute." 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company says that its 256-core CPU will use the same
                    cooling system as its existing offerings, which implies that
                    its thermal design power will remain in the 350-watt
                    ballpark.

                    cloud instances, its capabilities for AI are fairly limited.
                    The company itself says that its 128-core AmpereOne CPU with
                    its two 128-bit vector units per core (and supporting INT8,
                    INT16, FP16, and BFloat16 formats) can offer performance
                    comparable to Nvidia's A10 GPU, albeit at lower power. [...]
                    So, it teamed up with Qualcomm, and the two companies plan
                    to build platforms for LLM inferencing based on Ampere's
                    CPUs and <a

                    Neuralink, the Elon Musk-funded neuroscience startup, has
                    received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
                    to implant its next patient with its experimental brain
                    chip. This next operation will seek to fix certain issues
                    that occurred following its first implantation operation.

                    paraplegic man, Noland Arbaugh, in an operation that was
                    publicly announced this past January. Arbaugh’s identity was
                    revealed during a

                    in March, during which the patient demonstrated some of the
                    abilities the chip had given him, including the chance to
                    play computer chess with his mind. It was recently revealed,
                    however, that Arbaugh’s chip had malfunctioned and, for a
                    period of time, experienced data leakage.

                    The company has now received federal approval to continue
                    implanting patients with its chip, with the promise that it
                    will work out the kinks that caused problems with Arbaugh’s
                    chip, the Wall Street Journal

                      >originally reported</a
                    >. Arbaugh’s chip malfunctioned because some of the tiny
                    wires attached to the chip came loose and stopped channeling
                    signals from his brain to the company’s servers. In its next
                    operation, Neuralink plans to embed these tiny wires deeper
                    into the next patient’s brain. A source told the newspaper
                    that the company wants to implant as many as 10 additional
                    people with its chip by the end of this year.

                  <p>
                    Arbaugh recently opened up about his experience with the
                    company in a series of press interviews. During a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-05-16/neuralink-s-first-patient-describes-living-with-brain-implant"
                      >conversation with Bloomberg</a
                    >, Arbaugh explained the disappointment he felt when the
                    chip began malfunctioning:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “I started losing control of the cursor. I thought they’d
                    made some changes and that was the reason...But then they
                    told me that the threads were getting pulled out of my
                    brain. At first, they didn’t know how serious it would be or
                    a ton about it...It was really hard to hear. I thought I’d
                    gotten to use it for maybe a month, and then my journey was
                    coming to an end. I thought they would just keep collecting
                    some data but that they were really going to move on to the
                    next person. I cried a little bit.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, Arbaugh says that updates to the chip’s software
                    have allowed him to regain many of the abilities that he
                    previously had and that he is still very supportive of
                    Neuralink and what it’s done for him.

                    [...] SpaceX has yet to provide an update on the explosion,
                    which took place at its Boca Chica Starbase facilities in
                    southern Texas. The footage shows SpaceX's engine test pad

                  <p>
                    The footage started a little after 4:12 pm local time.
                    Roughly 14 seconds after ignition, the Raptor engine shut
                    off. As the vapor surrounding the test tower dissipated, a
                    fire appeared to start underneath the engine. These flames
                    traveled upwards, causing a second explosion to engulf the
                    entire tower.

                    Unresponsiveness in a distributed file system happened after
                    just 2.4 minutes of acoustic targeting, which also caused a
                    database's latency to increase by up to 92.7 percent. The
                    researchers say this method can completely destroy some
                    drives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The attacks were carried out 20 feet away from the
                    equipment, but Islam said some simple underwater robotics
                    could disrupt data centers from miles away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers looked at ways of mitigating the attacks:
                    sound-proof panels, but that raised the servers'
                    temperatures too much, and increasing the volume bypassed
                    this method; and active noise cancellation, which proved too
                    cumbersome and expensive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The ocean is awash in sound already. We've
                    demonstrated that these attacks can happen inadvertently
                    from something like a submarine sonar blast, which is
                    extremely loud," said co-author Kevin Butler, Ph.D., a UF
                    professor and director of the Florida Institute for
                    Cybersecurity Research. "So it's that much more important
                    that we know how to defend against these attacks. These are
                    issues that haven't been studied at all by the security
                    community."

                    "[Social Media] platforms select the content they show you,"
                    Zaman says. "They can promote anything, demote anything.
                    That means they can shift opinions any way they want."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As far as most social media users know, the most powerful
                    tool through which platforms steer public opinion is through
                    the outright removal of objectionable content or users. But
                    Zaman argues that there's a more potent means through which
                    social media platforms can control collective opinions over
                    time, called "shadow banning." Part of this tool's power
                    derives from the fact that it's currently near-impossible to
                    uncover, even by policymakers or software engineering
                    experts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For the study, the researchers built a simulation of a
                    real social network, and then succeeded in using shadow
                    banning to shift simulated users' opinions as well as
                    increasing and decreasing polarization. Even when the goal
                    was to use shadow banning to move collective sentiment to
                    the right or left, Zaman says, the content moderation policy
                    appeared neutral from an outside perspective. That's because
                    it's possible, he discovered, to shift opinions by turning
                    down the volume on accounts on both sides of a debate at the
                    same time.
                  </p>

                    "It's like a frog sitting in a pot of water; the frog's
                    relaxing, and suddenly, he's cooked," Zaman said. "A network
                    could, in fact, be driving people towards one point of view,
                    but if someone tries to call them out on it—like a
                    regulatory body—they're going to see the network censoring
                    both sides equally," Zaman says. "It looks like there's
                    nothing untoward happening, so they leave the network
                    alone—and suddenly everybody thinks the earth's flat. That's
                    what we find you could do with our technique, which is a
                    little scary."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Zaman plans to share his research with policymakers.
                    "I want to show them, 'Here's what this network can do; this
                    is the danger,'" he says. "If you're not going to ban them
                    but want to regulate them, this is how to do it—by
                    quantifying their content algorithm. This is how we should
                    be regulating all of the networks—X, Meta, Instagram,
                    YouTube, all of them.'"

                  <p>
                    May 20 (Reuters) - Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google has
                    preemptively paid damages to the U.S. government, an unusual
                    move aimed at avoiding a jury trial in the Justice
                    Department's antitrust lawsuit over its digital advertising
                    business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google disclosed the payment, but not the amount, in a court
                    filing last week that said the case should be heard and
                    decided by a judge directly. Without a monetary damages
                    claim, Google argued, the government has no right to a jury
                    trial.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Justice Department, which has not said if it will accept
                    the payment, declined to comment on the filing. Google
                    asserted that its check, which it said covered its alleged
                    overcharges for online ads, allows it to sidestep a jury
                    trial whether or not the government takes it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Justice Department filed the case last year with
                    Virginia and other states, alleging Google was stifling
                    competition for advertising technology. The government has
                    said Google should be forced to sell its ad manager suite.

                    Stanford Law School's Mark Lemley told Reuters he was
                    skeptical Google's gambit would prevail. He said a jury
                    could ultimately decide higher damages than whatever Google
                    put forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Antitrust cases regularly go to juries. I think it is a
                    sign that Google is worried about what a jury will do,"
                    Lemley said.

                  <p>
                    Another legal scholar, Herbert Hovenkamp of the University
                    of Pennsylvania's law school, called Google's move "smart"
                    in a post on X. "Juries are bad at deciding technical cases,
                    and further they do not have the authority to order a
                    breakup," he wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 2016 case that an offer
                    for "complete relief" did not wipe out a class-action claim.
                    But Google argued its payment is different, because it
                    submitted an actual check and not merely an offer.

                    not insignificant number of nuclear tipped Minuteman III
                    intercontinental ballistic missiles are housed. This,
                    according to the White House, makes MineOne a national
                    security risk.

                    MineOne acquired the property in 2022 with the goal of
                    operating a crypto mining facility on the site, the order
                    states. However, the sale wasn't registered with the
                    Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)
                    until after the government body received a tip from a member
                    of the public about the facility.

                  <p>
                    [...] "The proximity of foreign-owned real estate to a
                    strategic missile base and key element of America's Nuclear
                    triad, and the presence of specialized and foreign sourced
                    equipment, potentially capable of facilitating surveillance
                    and espionage activities, presents a national security risk
                    to the United States," the order reads.

                  <p>
                    [...] The executive order also placed limits on who MineOne
                    could sell to, presumably in an attempt to prevent the
                    datacenter from being transferred into another foreign firm.
                    If MineOne fails to comply with the order, the White House
                    has authorized the Attorney General to take any steps
                    necessary to enforce it, which presumably includes seizing
                    property and assets.

                        multitude of industries, at the expense of generally
                        unknowing US companies and persons. It impacted more
                        than 300 US companies, compromised more than 60
                        identities of US persons, caused false information to be
                        conveyed to DHS on more than 100 occasions, created
                        false tax liabilities for more than 35 US persons, and
                        resulted in at least $6.8 million of revenue to be
                        generated for the overseas IT workers. The overseas IT

                    charging a Ukrainian man with carrying out a similar
                    multiyear scheme. Oleksandr Didenko, 27, of Kyiv, Ukraine,
                    allegedly helped individuals in North Korea "market"

                    Chapman was arrested Wednesday. It wasn't immediately known
                    when she or Didenko were scheduled to make their first
                    appearance in court. If convicted, Chapman faces 97.5 years

                    Nickel monosilicide (NiSi) is widely used to connect
                    transistors in semiconductor circuits. Earlier theoretical
                    calculations had incorrectly predicted that NiSi was not
                    magnetic. As a result, researchers had never fully explored
                    magnetism in NiSi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Recently, however, scientists used neutron scattering to
                    identify an elusive form of magnetic order in NiSi. The
                    research is

                    in the journal <i>Advanced Materials</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Because NiSi is extensively used by the semiconductor
                    industry, it is already compatible with chip manufacturing.
                    Physicists used neutron scattering at the Spallation Neutron
                    Source, a Department of Energy user facility at Oak Ridge
                    National Laboratory, to uncover magnetic order in single
                    crystal NiSi that had not been previously known.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The robust magnetic structure and coupling of
                    magnetic-electronic properties of NiSi offer the opportunity
                    to use NiSi for magnetic memory applications. The research
                    team also applied density functional theory combined with
                    the self-(electron) interaction correction method (instead
                    of using the local density approximation) to identify the
                    origin of magnetism as arising from hybridization between Ni
                    3d orbitals and Si sp states.

                  <p>
                    Harnessing the newly discovered magnetism of NiSi in
                    semiconductors may lead to faster computers and computer
                    memory. The unique magnetism in NiSi is attractive because
                    electronics that use magnetism to store and process data are
                    reliable, fast, and small. The result is increased
                    capabilities at lower costs. The work also highlights the
                    need for improvements in how scientists apply conventional
                    modeling to certain materials.

                    As millions of American workers have been thrown out of work
                    by the Covid-19 pandemic and filed unemployment claims, many

                    In early April, during his daily press conference related to
                    the coronavirus crisis, New Jersey governor Phil Murphy made
                    an appeal for volunteer programmers who know COBOL, the
                    computer language on which the state's unemployment benefits
                    system operates.

                    "Literally, we have systems that are 40-plus-years-old,"
                    Murphy said. "There'll be lots of postmortems. and one of
                    them on our list will be, how did we get here where we
                    literally needed COBOL programmers?"

                    The May 2024 edition of the TIOBE Index includes a couple of
                    surprising results, placing two of the most ancient
                    programming languages among the top spots in popularity
                    among developers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Fortran, a compiled language originally created by IBM
                    in 1957, is especially suited to numeric computation and
                    scientific computing tasks. According to the index, this
                    ancient language is still the 10th most popular programming
                    technology. Fortran reentered the top 10 after more than 20
                    years, and TIOBE Software CEO Paul Jansen has provided some
                    explanations for this seemingly odd situation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The TIOBE Index simply "publishes what has been measured,"
                    and Fortran is apparently the subject of more than a
                    thousand books available on Amazon. New, "cool" languages
                    such as Kotlin and Rust barely hit 300 books for the same
                    search query, Jansen said, while Fortran is still evolving,
                    with the latest ISO definition for the language published in
                    2023.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The main reason for Fortran's resurgence, however, is
                    its aptitude for mathematical computing. Fortran has some
                    competition, but each newer language has its own issues.
                    Python is slow, MATLAB is "very easy" for math-related
                    computations but costly, and C/C++ are fast but lack native
                    support for complex math. In this jungle of languages,
                    Jansen said, Fortran still has a reason to exist.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for Cobol, its popularity is even easier to understand.
                    The English-like language was designed for business use in
                    1959 and is now the 20th most popular programming
                    technology. Cobol is still widely used in mainframe
                    computers employed in critical industries such as banking,
                    automotive, insurance, and more. IBM is proposing an

                    To do this, they allegedly deployed "bait transactions"
                    designed to catch the attention of specialized bots often
                    used to help buyers and sellers find lucrative prospects in
                    the ethereum network. When bots snatched up the bait, their
                    validators seemingly exploited a vulnerability in the
                    process commonly used to structure blocks to alter the
                    transaction by reordering the block to their advantage
                    before adding the block to the blockchain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When victims detected the theft, they tried to request the
                    funds be returned, but the DOJ alleged that the brothers
                    rejected those requests and hid the money instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The brothers' online search history showed that they studied
                    up and "took numerous steps to hide their ill-gotten gains,"
                    the DOJ alleged. These steps included "setting up shell
                    companies and using multiple private cryptocurrency
                    addresses and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges" that
                    specifically did not rely on detailed "know your customer"
                    (KYC) procedures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They also researched the "very crimes charged in the
                    indictment," the DOJ said. Among search terms found in the
                    brothers' history during the planning phase of the alleged
                    scheme were phrases like "how to wash crypto" and "exchanges
                    with no KYC." Later, seemingly attempting to prepare for any
                    legal consequences from the scheme, the brothers allegedly
                    searched for things like "top crypto lawyers," and "money
                    laundering statute of limitations," and "does the United
                    States extradite to [foreign country]."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To uncover the scheme, the special agent in charge, Thomas
                    Fattorusso of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) New
                    York Field Office, said that investigators "simply followed
                    the money."

                  <p>
                    Last month Dame Victoria Sharp and Mr Justice Johnson
                    dismissed most of Mr Assange's legal arguments but said that
                    unless assurances were given by the US he would be able to
                    bring an appeal on three grounds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These assurances were that Mr Assange would be protected by
                    and allowed to rely on the first amendment – which protects
                    freedom of speech in the US – that he is not "prejudiced at
                    trial" due to his nationality, and that the death penalty is
                    not imposed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Judges later confirmed the US had provided an assurance to
                    the court, however Ms Assange dismissed the promises as
                    "blatant weasel words".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Edward Fitzgerald KC, representing Mr Assange in the latest
                    hearing, accepted a promise that he would not face the death
                    penalty but insisted other assurances provided by the US
                    were "blatantly inadequate".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the issue of whether he would be prejudiced by reason of
                    his nationality or use the first amendment as a defence at
                    trial, Mr Fitzgerald said: "This is not an assurance at all.
                    It assures only that Mr Assange 'may seek to' raise the
                    first amendment."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He added: "What needs to be conclusively removed is the risk
                    that he will be prevented from relying on the first
                    amendment on grounds of nationality."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However James Lewis KC, for the US government, insisted
                    that Mr Assange's conduct was "simply unprotected" by the
                    first amendment.

                Made by Boeing, that might not inspire one with confidence due
                the current aircraft issues they have.

                    U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing plans to enter the flying
                    car business in Asia by 2030, looking to tap demand for the
                    fast, short-distance travel the vehicles could provide in
                    the region's traffic-choked cities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The company is developing electric vertical take-off
                    and landing (eVTOL) craft at subsidiary Wisk Aero. The
                    aircraft will adopt autonomous technology, rare among eVTOL
                    craft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The plan is to first obtain certification in the U.S. before
                    expanding into Asia. Details of the Asia business will be
                    finalized in the future, including whether Boeing will sell
                    the aircraft to companies aiming to provide eVTOL
                    transportation services or operate the services itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Boeing is currently selecting its first Asian market,
                    including Japan. In Japan, domestic startup SkyDrive and
                    Germany's Volocopter are scheduled to operate air taxi
                    services at the 2025 Osaka World Expo.

                    Boeing opened a research and development base in Nagoya on
                    Thursday. It first established R&amp;D operations in Japan
                    in 2022 but had been renting space from other companies
                    until now.

                    [...] The single-occupant aircraft was developed by a US
                    company. It measures 4.5 meters wide and 2.6 meters high.
                    [...] Officials said the craft can fly at a maximum speed of
                    about 100 kph. It can stay aloft for approximately 15
                    minutes.

                    Buried under the news from Google I/O this week is one of
                    Google Cloud's biggest blunders ever: Google's Amazon Web
                    Services competitor accidentally deleted a giant customer
                    account for no reason. UniSuper, an Australian pension fund
                    that manages $135 billion worth of funds and has 647,000
                    members, had its entire account wiped out at Google Cloud,
                    including all its backups that were stored on the service.
                    UniSuper thankfully had some backups with a different
                    provider and was able to recover its data, but according to
                    UniSuper's incident log, downtime started May 2, and a full
                    restoration of services didn't happen until May 15.

                    Peter Chun, and Google Cloud CEO, Thomas Kurian." This
                    statement reads, "Google Cloud CEO, Thomas Kurian has
                    confirmed that the disruption arose from an unprecedented
                    sequence of events whereby an inadvertent misconfiguration
                    during provisioning of UniSuper's Private Cloud services
                    ultimately resulted in the deletion of UniSuper's Private
                    Cloud subscription. This is an isolated, 'one-of-a-kind
                    occurrence' that has never before occurred with any of
                    Google Cloud's clients globally. This should not have
                    happened. Google Cloud has identified the events that led to
                    this disruption and taken measures to ensure this does not
                    happen again."

                    migration to Google, with Sam Cooper, UniSuper's Head of
                    Architecture, saying, "With Google Cloud VMware Engine,
                    migrating to the cloud is streamlined and extremely easy.
                    It's all about efficiencies that help us deliver highly

                    through this catastrophe. The first update is May 2 with the
                    ominous statement, "You may be aware of a service disruption
                    affecting UniSuper's systems." UniSuper immediately seemed
                    to have the problem nailed down, saying, "The issue
                    originated from one of our third-party service providers,
                    and we're actively partnering with them to resolve this." On
                    May 3, Google Cloud publicly entered the picture with a
                    joint statement from UniSuper and Google Cloud saying that
                    the outage was not the result of a cyberattack.

                  <p>
                    [...] The joint statement and the outage updates are still
                    not a technical post-mortem of what happened, and it's
                    unclear if we'll get one. Google PR

                      >Daniel Compton</a
                    >
                    points out that the statement is not just vague, it's also
                    full of terminology that doesn't align with Google Cloud
                    products. The imprecise language makes it seem like the
                    statement was written entirely by UniSuper. It would be nice
                    to see a real breakdown of what happened from Google Cloud's
                    perspective, especially when other current or potential
                    customers are going to keep a watchful eye on how Google
                    handles the fallout from this.

                underlying question being about how the tracking is occurring.
                The context is that many libraries use DRM'd mobile phone apps
                to allow limited, temporary access to e-books to the subset of
                patrons willing to install the app to the subset of patrons
                willing to agree to the app's terms of service to the subset of
                patrons with smart phones.

                    In December, 2023, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
                    information sciences professor Masooda Bashir led a study
                    titled "Patron Privacy Protections in Public Libraries" that
                    was published in The Library Quarterly. The study found that
                    while libraries generally have basic privacy protections,
                    there are often gaps in staff training and in privacy
                    disclosures made available to patrons.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It also found that some libraries rely exclusively on social
                    media for their online presence. "That is very troubling,"
                    said Bashir in
                    <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/1957463911"
                      >a statement</a
                    >. "Facebook collects a lot of data – everything that
                    someone might be reading and looking at. That is not a good
                    practice for public libraries."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Salo said that the amount of visitor-tracking scripts on
                    many library websites is just beyond the pale.

                  <p>
                    "I have been watching actually the situation with healthcare
                    organizations getting absolutely nailed to the wall for
                    Google pixels and Facebook pixels and what have you, as
                    potential HIPAA violations," she said.

                The assertion is that this level of tracking is not supposed to
                happen with library services, as per professional decisions by
                earlier generations of librarians. The terms of service and
                licensing which both the libraries and their patrons gave the
                nod to may even explicitly allow the surveillance and warn of it
                buried in scores of pages of legalese. Be that as it may, the
                apps creators (and the purchasers, the libraries) may even be
                unknowingly affected by
                <a

                patrons have become so unversed in mobile ICT as to buy and
                deploy such DRMed software-as-a-service, which contain two kinds
                of violations of basic rights: digital restrictions and
                tracking. Academic librarian, Dorothea Salo, is off to a good
                start in mitigating the problems but there is a lot to catch up
                on.

                    Personal computing has changed a lot in the past four
                    decades, and one of the biggest changes, perhaps the most
                    unheralded, comes down to compatibility. These days, you
                    generally can't fry a computer by plugging in a joystick
                    that the computer doesn't support. Simply put,
                    standardization slowly fixed this. One of the best examples
                    of a bedrock standard is the peripheral component
                    interconnect, or PCI, which came about in the early 1990s
                    and appeared in some of the decade's earliest consumer
                    machines three decades ago this year. To this day, PCI slots
                    are used to connect network cards, sound cards, disc
                    controllers, and other peripherals to computer motherboards
                    via a bus that carries data and control signals. PCI's
                    lessons gradually shaped other standards, like USB, and
                    ultimately made computers less frustrating. So how did we
                    get it? Through a moment of canny deception.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] So how did we end up with the standards that we have
                    today, and the PCI expansion card standard specifically? PCI
                    wasn't the only game in town—you could argue, for example,
                    that if things played out differently,

                    architecture. But it was a standard seemingly for the long
                    haul, far beyond other competing standards of its era.

                  <p>
                    Who's responsible for spearheading this standard? Intel.
                    While PCI was a cross-platform technology, it proved to be
                    an important strategy for the chipmaker to consolidate its
                    power over the PC market at a time when IBM had taken its
                    foot off the gas, choosing to focus on

                    North Korea laundered $147.5 million through virtual
                    currency platform Tornado Cash in March after stealing it
                    last year from a cryptocurrency exchange, according to
                    confidential work by United Nations sanctions monitors seen
                    by Reuters on Tuesday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The monitors told a U.N. Security Council sanctions
                    committee in a document submitted on Friday that they had
                    been investigating 97 suspected North Korean cyberattacks on
                    cryptocurrency companies between 2017 and 2024, valued at
                    some $3.6 billion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That included an attack late last year where $147.5 million
                    was stolen from HTX cryptocurrency exchange before being
                    laundered in March this year, the monitors told the
                    committee, citing information from crypto analytics firm
                    PeckShield and blockchain research firm Elliptic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2024 alone, the monitors said they had been looking at
                    "11 cryptocurrency thefts ... valued at $54.7 million,"
                    adding that many of those "may have been conducted by DPRK
                    IT workers inadvertently hired by small crypto-related
                    companies."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The monitors said that according to U.N. member states and
                    private companies, North Korean IT workers operating abroad
                    generate "substantial income for the country."

                    the annual renewal of their mandate. Some of the monitors
                    submitted unfinished work, which was shared with the
                    council's North Korea sanctions committee on Friday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Traditionally, reports by the sanctions monitors are first
                    agreed by all eight members. The unfinished work submitted
                    to the committee did not go through that process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The monitors said they had been investigating a Feb. 6 New
                    York Times report that Russia released $9 million out of $30
                    million in frozen North Korean assets and allowed Pyongyang
                    to open an account at a Russian bank in South Ossetia so it
                    could better obtain access to international banking
                    networks.
