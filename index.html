                <div>
                  <p>
                    The amended ISA also states the co-located load "is not
                    intended to consume capacity and/or energy from the PJM
                    transmission system [the grid]," but it is "possible that it
                    will."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Exelon and AEP expressed concern that it was unclear what
                    steps have been taken to ensure any such withdrawal of power
                    from the grid would be properly metered and accurately
                    billed when it does occur, and who would be financially
                    responsible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In its summary, FERC said PJM had not demonstrated that its
                    proposed "non-conforming" provisions in the amended ISA are
                    necessary deviations from the existing agreement, and
                    therefore rejected it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One dissenting voice was FERC Chairman Willie L Phillips,
                    who claimed the order was "a step backward for both electric
                    reliability and national security." He said he believed that
                    PJM had addressed reliability issues comprehensively in its
                    filing, and the ruling risks America's leadership in AI
                    because "reliable electricity is the lifeblood" of the
                    datacenters required for developing AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, Commissioner Mark C Christie explained that
                    co-location arrangements of this type present "an array of
                    complicated, nuanced, and multifaceted issues, which
                    collectively could have huge ramifications for both grid
                    reliability and consumer costs," and it was being rejected
                    because PJM had failed to meet its burden of proof.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the proposed amendment were approved at this time, he
                    warned: "we would be setting a precedent that would be used
                    to justify identical or similar arrangements in future
                    cases."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The move highlights the difficulties datacenter operators
                    face in expanding their facilities to keep pace with the
                    booming demand for training and operating the latest AI
                    models, and the challenges that power companies face in
                    delivering the energy required.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, thanks to the efforts of a team of scientists from
                    Scandinavia, Iceland, and Ireland, we have direct, tangible
                    evidence that the Well Man really existed – in the form of
                    bones, freshly analyzed, discovered at the bottom of the
                    very well described.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Well Man is barely a throwaway line describing a
                    conflict that took place in 1197 CE – a corpse thrown into a
                    castle well by an invading force, probably to make any water
                    therein undrinkable by decaying in it. But that throwaway
                    line has suddenly become one of the most significant in the
                    <em>saga</em> – by being the first incident in such a
                    document ever to be linked to real, historical remains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This is the first time that a person described in
                    these historical texts has actually been found," Martin
                    says. "There are a lot of these medieval and ancient remains
                    all around Europe, and they're increasingly being studied
                    using genomic methods."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The event was a stealth attack carried out by the
                    Roman Catholic enemies of King Sverre (known as Baglers, or
                    <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bagal">Bagal</a>,
                    for the crosiers carried by bishops). While he wintered
                    elsewhere, the Baglers invaded his castle in his absence.

                      >saga reads</a
                    >. "The Bagals seized all the property in the castle, and
                    then they burnt every building of it. They took a dead man
                    and cast him into the well, and then filled it up with
                    stones. Before they left the castle they called upon the
                    townsmen to break down all the stone walls; and before they
                    marched from the town they burnt all the King's long-ships.
                    After this they returned to the Uplands, well pleased with
                    the booty they had gained in their journey."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the saga, the Baglers spared the people within,
                    leaving them nothing but their clothes – but fresh corpses
                    don't fall from the sky, and it's plausible that the event
                    wasn't completely bloodless. The Well Man may even have been
                    a Bagler himself, slain by the castle's defenders.

                    In 2022, three companies with strange names and no clear
                    business purpose beyond patent litigation filed dozens of
                    lawsuits in Delaware federal court, accusing businesses of
                    all sizes of patent infringement. Some of these complaints
                    claimed patent rights over basic aspects of modern life;
                    one, for example, involved a
                    <a

                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These companies–named Mellaconic IP, Backertop Licensing,
                    and Nimitz Technologies–seemed to be typical examples of
                    "patent trolls," companies whose primary business is suing
                    others over patents or demanding licensing fees rather than
                    providing actual products or services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the cases soon took an unusual turn. The Delaware
                    federal judge overseeing the cases, U.S. District Judge Colm
                    Connolly, sought more information about the patents and
                    their ownership. One of the alleged owners was a food-truck
                    operator who had been promised "passive income," but was
                    entitled to only a small portion of any revenue generated
                    from the lawsuits. Another owner was the spouse of an
                    attorney at IP Edge, the patent-assertion company linked to
                    all three LLCs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Following an extensive investigation, the judge determined
                    that attorneys associated with these shell companies had
                    violated legal ethics rules. He pointed out that the
                    attorneys may have misled Han Bui, the food-truck owner,
                    about his potential liability in the case. Judge Connolly
                    wrote:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>

                        and the IP Edge and Mavexar actors who dealt with him
                        underscore that counsel's failures to comply with the
                        Model Rules of Professional Conduct while representing
                        Mr. Bui and his LLC in the Mellaconic cases are not
                        merely technical or academic.

                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Judge Connolly also concluded that IP Edge, the
                    patent-assertion company behind hundreds of patent lawsuits
                    and linked to the three LLCs, was the "de facto owner" of
                    the patents asserted in his court, but that it attempted to
                    hide its involvement. He wrote, "IP Edge, however, has gone
                    to great lengths to hide the 'we' from the world," with "we"
                    referring to IP Edge. Connolly further noted, "IP Edge
                    arranged for the patents to be assigned to LLCs it formed
                    under the names of relatively unsophisticated individuals
                    recruited by [IP Edge office manager] Linh Deitz."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The judge referred three IP Edge attorneys to the Supreme
                    Court of Texas' Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee for
                    engaging in "unauthorized practices of law in Texas." Judge
                    Connolly also sent a letter to the Department of Justice,
                    suggesting an investigation into "individuals associated
                    with IP Edge LLC and its affiliate Maxevar LLC."

                Reaction Engines was the company of Alan Bond, of HOTOL (1980s
                space plane) fame, which he founded to develop new air-breathing
                rocket engine technology. Their flagship project was the Skylon
                Single Stage to Orbit space plane, which would use Synergistic
                Air-Breathing Ram-jet Engines (SABRE) to capture oxygen from the
                atmosphere, cool and compress it and burn it with on-board
                liquid hydrogen up to about Mach 5. Then, at speed and altitude,
                the spacecraft would switch to on-board oxygen stores. In this
                way, more mass fraction could be dedicated to payload, making
                SSTO economically feasible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, based on similar technology was LAPCAT, a hypersonic
                airliner.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet another great British Engineering vision finds its way onto
                the scrapheap for lack of vision among investors. Still, we
                export a lot of cheese.

                    like Delphi, Free Pascal, Lazarus, and others that have
                    developed over the years. And regardless of which version

                    unique to the table. Together, they keep Pascal relevant and

                    Tactile controls are back in vogue. Apple added two new
                    buttons to the iPhone 16, home appliances like stoves and
                    washing machines are returning to knobs, and several car
                    manufacturers are reintroducing buttons and dials to
                    dashboards and steering wheels.

                    With this "re-buttonization," as The Wall Street Journal
                    describes it, demand for Rachel Plotnick's expertise has
                    grown. Plotnick, an associate professor of Cinema and Media
                    Studies at Indiana University in Bloomington, is the leading
                    expert on buttons and how people interact with them. She
                    studies the relationship between technology and society with
                    a focus on everyday or overlooked technologies, and wrote
                    the 2018 book Power Button: A History of Pleasure, Panic,
                    and the Politics of Pushing. Now, companies are reaching out
                    to her to help improve their tactile controls.

                  <p>
                    UCLA chemists have discovered a major flaw in a fundamental
                    rule of organic chemistry that has held for 100 years. They
                    say it's time to rewrite the textbooks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Organic molecules, which are primarily made of carbon, have
                    specific shapes and arrangements of atoms. Molecules called
                    olefins contain double bonds, or alkenes, between two carbon
                    atoms. Typically, these atoms and their attached groups lie
                    in the same 3D plane, and deviations from this structure are
                    rare.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rule being questioned, known as Bredt's rule, was
                    established in 1924. It asserts that molecules cannot have a
                    double bond at the "bridgehead" position—the junction of a
                    bridged bicyclic molecule—because this position would
                    distort the geometry of the double bond. Bredt's rule has
                    constrained the design of synthetic molecules by preventing
                    chemists from creating certain structures. Since olefins
                    play a critical role in pharmaceutical research, Bredt's
                    rule has limited the types of molecules that scientists
                    could envision, potentially holding back innovations in drug
                    discovery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A new paper published on November 1 by UCLA scientists in
                    the journal Science has invalidated that idea. They show how
                    to make several kinds of molecules that violate Bredt's
                    rule, called anti-Bredt olefins, or ABOs, allowing chemists
                    to find practical ways to make and use them in reactions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "People aren't exploring anti-Bredt olefins because they
                    think they can't," said corresponding author Neil Garg, the
                    Kenneth N. Trueblood Distinguished Professor of Chemistry
                    and Biochemistry at UCLA. "We shouldn't have rules like this
                    — or if we have them, they should only exist with the
                    constant reminder that they're guidelines, not rules. It
                    destroys creativity when we have rules that supposedly can't
                    be overcome."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "There's a big push in the pharmaceutical industry to
                    develop chemical reactions that give three-dimensional
                    structures like ours because they can be used to discover
                    new medicines," Garg said. "What this study shows is that
                    contrary to one hundred years of conventional wisdom,
                    chemists can make and use anti-Bredt olefins to make
                    value-added products."

                    Now its satellite provider GlobalStar has announced a new
                    expansion of its Apple deal, which comes in two parts. The
                    first has Apple paying up to $1.1 billion in upfront
                    payments specifically so GlobalStar can add what it
                    describes as a new satellite constellation.

                  <p>
                    The second is that Apple has now taken a 20% stake in
                    GlobalStar. According to <em>Street Insider</em>, this is an

                  <p>
                    This announcement is a financial one from GlobalStar, rather
                    than specific news of new features from either it or Apple.
                    But it will result in greater capacity for expanded features
                    on the iPhone.

                Nvidia will replace Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
                indicating the massive impact of the AI boom on the
                semiconductor and tech industries and the entire market.
                According to
                <a
                  href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/nvidia-to-join-dow-jones-industrial-average-replacing-intel.html?s=31"
                  >CNBC</a
                >, this change will happen on November 8, about three months
                after news of Intel's financial woes broke out.
              </p>
              <p>
                The move was sparked by Intel's massive stock price drop—over
                30% overnight—following the disastrous financial results
                released last August. The company has been bleeding cash through
                its data center and foundry divisions, resulting in a $1.6
                billion loss for the second quarter of 2024. This was soon
                followed by news of massive layoffs, with over 15,000 employees
                affected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nvidia shares, on the other hand, have climbed over 170% so far
                in 2024 after jumping roughly 240% last year, as investors have
                rushed to get a piece of the AI chipmaker. Nvidia's market cap
                has swelled to $3.3 trillion, second only to Apple among
                publicly traded companies.

                    Scientists in Virginia are looking for mysterious dark
                    matter - and have turned to really old rocks.

                    in the universe, shapes and affects the cosmos. But it is
                    entirely invisible and remains undetectable by normal
                    sensors and techniques.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Analyzing billion-year-old rocks, researchers at Virginia
                    Tech hope to find traces of dark matter. The idea was first
                    proposed in the 1980s. Technological advances since then led
                    them to revisit the idea. What if there were traces in
                    Earth's minerals?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's crazy. When I first heard about this idea, I was like
                    — this is insane. I want to do it," physics professor
                    Patrick Huber said in a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Using new imaging, Huber and his colleagues hope to
                    uncover trails of destruction from long-ago dark matter
                    interactions inside crystal lattice structures - a pattern
                    of atoms found in a mineral crystal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dark matter's interactions with other matter is impossible
                    to perceive except when it collides with the nucleus of a
                    visible matter atom. The nucleus recoils from the collision
                    and releases energy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Vsevolod Ivanov, who is collaborating with Huber, explained
                    that when a high-energy particle inside a rock bounces off
                    of the charged core of an atom – the basic building block of
                    matter – inside a rock, backward movement can pop that core,
                    or nucleus, out of place. The gap the nucleus leaves behind
                    marks structural changes within the crystal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We'll take a crystal that's been exposed to different
                    particles for millions of years and subtract the
                    distributions that correspond to things we do know," Ivanov
                    said. "Whatever is left must be something new, and that
                    could be the dark matter."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers are working to identify and locate potential
                    candidates that could be dark matter detectors.

                    unfair to be enforceable.

                    As my Reuters colleague Mike Scarcella

                      >reported</a
                    >, the appeals court concluded that the mass arbitration
                    protocol offered by Live Nation's arbitration provider, New
                    Era, featured rules that were "so dense, convoluted and
                    internally contradictory to be borderline unintelligible."
                    (New Era disputed that characterization, insisting that its
                    rules are "objective [and] easy to understand.")
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    In a concurrence, VanDyke said flatly, "The Federal
                    Arbitration Act just does not apply to the type of mass
                    'arbitration' contemplated by Live Nation's agreements."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That has to be a chilling sentence for companies relying on
                    batch-and-bellwether protocols to mitigate the time and
                    expense of defending thousands of arbitration demands.

                    First, take a 15-kilogram bar of beryllium (or some similar
                    material) and cool it almost all the way to absolute zero,
                    the minimum possible temperature. Sapped of all heat, the
                    bar will sit in its minimum-energy “ground” state. All the
                    atoms of the bar will act together as one quantum system,
                    akin to one hulking atom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, wait until a gravitational wave from deep space passes
                    by. The odds that any particular graviton will interact with
                    the beryllium bar are low, but the wave will contain so many
                    gravitons that the overall odds of at least one interaction
                    are high. The group calculated that approximately one in
                    three gravitational waves of the right sort (neutron star
                    collisions work best since their mergers last longer than
                    black hole mergers) would make the bar ring with one quantum
                    unit of energy. If your bar reverberates in concert with a
                    gravitational wave confirmed by LIGO, you will have
                    witnessed a quantized event caused by gravity.

                    Among a handful of engineering hurdles involved in opening
                    that window, the highest would be putting a heavy object
                    into its ground state and sensing it jumping to its
                    next-lowest-energy state. One of the groups pushing the
                    state of the art on this front is at ETH Zurich, where Fadel
                    and his collaborators cool tiny sapphire crystals until they
                    display quantum properties. In 2023, the team succeeded in
                    putting a crystal into

                    — another hallmark of a quantum system. Its mass was 16
                    millionths of a gram — heavy for a quantum object, but still
                    half a billion times lighter than Pikovski’s bar.
                    Nevertheless, Fadel considers the proposal to be achievable.
                    “It wouldn’t be too crazy,” he said.

                    [...] Now graviton chasers find themselves in a peculiar
                    position. On the main facts, everyone is in agreement. One,
                    detecting a quantum event sparked by a gravitational wave is
                    — surprisingly — possible. And two, doing so would not
                    explicitly prove that the gravitational wave is quantized.
                    “Could you make a classical gravitational wave that would
                    produce the same signal? The answer is yes,” said Carney,

                    It might motivate subsequent experiments that would take
                    physicists deeper into the quantum gravity era, just as
                    scattering experiments once took them deeper into the era of
                    the photon. Physicists now know that quantum mechanics is
                    much more than quantization. Quantum systems can take on
                    combinations of states known as superpositions, for
                    instance, and their parts can become “entangled” in such a
                    way that measuring one reveals information about the other.
                    Experiments establishing that gravity exhibits these
                    phenomena would provide

                    for quantum gravity, and researchers are already exploring
                    what it would take to carry them out.

                    None of these tests of gravity’s quantum side are completely
                    ironclad, but each would contribute some hard data regarding
                    the finest features of the universe’s weakest force. Now a
                    frigid quantum bar of beryllium appears to be a prime
                    candidate for an experiment that will mark the first step
                    down that long and winding road.

                    Fisker had begun deliveries of its Ocean battery-electric
                    crossover SUV in 2023 to compete with Tesla, but by February
                    2024 the vehicle began having various problems. Some of the
                    problems included suddenly losing power, loss of brake
                    power, defective key fobs, and front hoods opening at high
                    speeds. The vehicle also had difficulties with gear
                    shifting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fisker warned that it may not have enough money to survive
                    the next 12 months in its fourth-quarter earnings report on
                    Feb. 29. Other problems arose as in June, former Fisker
                    employees revealed the company had no plan to stockpile
                    spare parts for Ocean vehicle repairs.

                  <p>
                    The spare parts problem led technicians and employees to
                    dismantle perfectly good cars to provide spare parts.

                    interested in making money, but the social media platform's
                    drive to reach profitability intensified with its API rule
                    changes, which was followed by it

                    and other big moves. With Reddit reporting this week that it
                    has finally turned its first profit, we can expect further
                    evolution from Reddit, whether old-time Redditors like it or
                    not.

                      >PDF</a
                    >], Reddit said that in the quarter ending on September 30,
                    it made a profit of $29.9 million. This is significant
                    growth from fiscal Q3 2024, when Reddit lost $7.4 million.
                    Revenue, meanwhile, was up 68 percent year over year, going
                    from $207.5 million to $384.4 million. Reddit is expecting
                    $385 to $400 million in revenue for fiscal Q4.

                    [...] Of course, more users give ads sold on Reddit the
                    chance to gain more eyeballs, something that can help drive
                    ad sales. Reddit's ad revenue has grown alongside its daily
                    user base. In Q3 2024, Reddit made $315.1 million in ad
                    revenue, a 56 percent year-over-year increase.

                    Reddit has historically made the majority of its revenue
                    from ad sales. Huffman has long claimed that Reddit started

                    training. However, the high pricing killing third-party apps
                    also fed Reddit's goals of getting users onto its native
                    website and apps—where Reddit sells ads.

                  <p>
                    Reddit is expected to continue its aggressive ads push,
                    including by exploring new ways to incorporate ads into the
                    user experience. For example, Reddit has previously
                    discussed exploring the addition of

                    Much of mathematics is driven by intuition, by a deep-rooted
                    sense of what should be true. But sometimes instinct can
                    lead a mathematician astray. Early evidence might not
                    represent the bigger picture; a statement might seem
                    obvious, only for some hidden subtlety to reveal itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unexpectedly, three mathematicians have now shown that a
                    well-known hypothesis in probability theory called the
                    bunkbed conjecture falls into this category. The conjecture
                    — which is about the different ways you can navigate the
                    mathematical mazes called graphs when they’re stacked on top
                    of each other like bunk beds — seemed natural, even
                    self-evident. “Anything our brain tells us suggests the
                    conjecture should be true,” said
                    <a href="https://web.math.princeton.edu/~mchudnov/"
                      >Maria Chudnovsky</a
                    >, a graph theorist at Princeton University who was not
                    involved in the new work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the mid-1980s, a Dutch physicist named Pieter
                    Kasteleyn wanted to mathematically prove an assertion about
                    how liquids flow throughout porous solids. His work led him
                    to pose the bunkbed conjecture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The bunkbed conjecture says that the probability of
                    finding the path on the bottom bunk is always greater than
                    or equal to the probability of finding the path that jumps
                    to the top bunk. It doesn’t matter what graph you start
                    with, or how many vertical posts you draw between the bunks,
                    or which starting and ending vertices you choose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For decades, mathematicians thought this had to be true.
                    Their intuition told them that moving around on just one
                    bunk should be easier than moving between two — that the
                    extra vertical jump required to get from the lower to the
                    upper bunk should significantly limit the number of
                    available paths.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In June,
                    <a href="https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/lh569"
                      >Lawrence Hollom</a
                    >
                    of the University of Cambridge disproved a version of the
                    bunkbed problem in a different context. Instead of dealing
                    with graphs, this formulation of the conjecture asked about
                    objects called hypergraphs. In a hypergraph, an edge is no
                    longer defined as the connection between a pair of vertices,
                    but rather as the connection between any number of vertices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the meantime, Pak says, it’s clear that
                    mathematicians need to engage in a more active discussion
                    about the nature of mathematical proof. He and his
                    colleagues ultimately didn’t have to rely on controversial
                    computational methods; they were able to disprove the
                    conjecture with total certainty. But as computer- and
                    AI-based lines of attack become more common in mathematics
                    research, some mathematicians are debating whether the
                    field’s norms will eventually have to change. “It’s a
                    philosophical question,” Alon said. “How do we view proofs
                    that are only true with high probability?”

                    Chipzilla also faced $3.1 billion of impaired charges
                    related to Intel 7 manufacturing equipment – which cannot be
                    used for more advanced process nodes like Intel 18A that
                    rely on more modern extreme ultraviolet lithography
                    equipment.

                  <p>
                    Intel also booked a $2.9 billion charge associated with the

                    largely attributed to autonomous driving tech unit Mobileye.

                    Combined, these factors contributed to a $16.6 billion

                    Ever the optimist, Gelsinger couldn't help but put a
                    positive spin on the ordeal. He declared that that Intel is
                    well on its way to "completing what will be one of the most
                    seminal restructurings in the history [of the company]. The
                    steps that we took in our financial restructuring this
                    quarter was very critical to be able to bring us to a point
                    where we can say we have capacity to drive long-term
                    shareholder return."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During the third quarter, Intel saw modest revenue growth
                    across its various divisions – at least on a sequential
                    basis. Intel Products – which includes Client, Datacenter,
                    and Networking – grew 3.3 percent as a whole while Intel
                    foundry was up 2.2 percent compared to last quarter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, compared to this time last year, revenues remain
                    depressed with Product and Foundry down 2 percent and 8
                    percent respectively – showing that the chipmaker is still a
                    long way from recovery
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Digging a little deeper we see that this decline isn't
                    entirely uniform. While client computing revenues were down
                    seven percent year over year to $7.3 billion in Q3,
                    datacenter sales grew by nine percent compared to last year,
                    bringing in $3.3 billion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Intel's networking group also saw modest gains during the
                    quarter, with revenues up four percent year on year to $1.5
                    billion.

                    When Microsoft launched its Copilot+ AI PC initiative over
                    the summer, one of the flagship features was Recall, a
                    feature that would log months' worth of your PC usage, with
                    the stated goal of helping you remember things you did and
                    find them again. But if you've heard of Recall, it's
                    probably because of the problems that surfaced in preview
                    builds of Windows before the feature could launch: It

                      >stored all of its data in plaintext</a
                    >, and it was relatively trivial for other users on the PC
                    (or for malicious software) to access the database and
                    screenshots, potentially exposing huge amounts of user data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Microsoft has officially announced that the Recall
                    preview is being delayed yet again and that it will begin
                    rolling out to testers in December.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are committed to delivering a secure and trusted
                    experience with Recall. To ensure we deliver on these
                    important updates, we're taking additional time to refine
                    the experience before previewing it with Windows Insiders,"
                    said Microsoft Windows Insider Senior Program Manager
                    Brandon LeBlanc in
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284572/microsoft-recall-delay-december-windows-insider-testing"

                  <p>
                    [...] When it does start to roll out, Recall will still
                    require a Copilot+ PC, which gets some AI-related features
                    not available to typical Windows 11 PCs. To meet the
                    Copilot+ requirements, PCs must have at least 16GB of RAM
                    and 256GB of storage, plus a neural processing unit (NPU)
                    that can perform at least 40 trillion operations per second
                    (TOPS).

                    A former jockey who was left paralyzed from the waist down
                    after a horse riding accident was able to walk again thanks
                    to a cutting-edge piece of robotic tech: a $100,000 ReWalk
                    Personal exoskeleton.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When one of its small parts malfunctioned, however, the
                    entire device stopped working. Desperate to gain his
                    mobility back, he reached out to the manufacturer, Lifeward,
                    for repairs. But it turned him away, claiming his
                    exoskeleton was too old,

                    "After 371,091 steps my exoskeleton is being retired after
                    10 years of unbelievable physical therapy," Michael Straight
                    posted on Facebook earlier this month. "The reasons why it
                    has stopped is a pathetic excuse for a bad company to try
                    and make more money."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Straight, the issue was caused by a piece of
                    wiring that had come loose from the battery that powered a
                    wristwatch used to control the exoskeleton. This would cost
                    peanuts for Lifeward to fix up, but it refused to service
                    anything more than five years old, Straight said.

                    [...] As this infuriating case shows, advanced medical
                    devices can change the lives of people living with severe
                    disabilities — but the flipside is that they also make their
                    owners dependent on the whims of the devices' manufacturers,
                    who often operate in ruthless self-interest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] That some of these manufacturers can come and go isn't
                    the point, though. As <em>404</em> notes, the issue is the
                    nefarious practices that many of them use to make their
                    devices difficult to fix without their help.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This is the dystopian nightmare that we've kind of
                    entered in, where the manufacturer perspective on products
                    is that their responsibility completely ends when it hands
                    it over to a customer," Nathan Proctor, head of the right to
                    repair project at the US Public Interest Research Group,
                    told <em>404</em>. "That's not good enough for a device like
                    this, but it's also the same thing we see up and down with
                    every single product."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "People need to be able to fix things, there needs to be a
                    plan in place," he added. "A $100,000 product you can only
                    use as long as the battery lasts, that's enraging."

                    In December, the verified Facebook page of Adam Klotz, a Fox
                    News meteorologist, started running strange video ads.

                  <p>
                    Some featured the distinctive voice of former President
                    Donald Trump promising "$6,400 with your name on it, no
                    payback required" just for clicking the ad and filling out a
                    form.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In other ads with the same offer, President Joe Biden's
                    well-known cadence assured viewers that "this isn't a loan
                    with strings attached."

                  <p>
                    There was no free cash. The audio was generated by AI.
                    People who clicked were taken to a form asking for their
                    personal information, which was sold to telemarketers who
                    could target them for legitimate offers — or scams.<br />[...]<br />Klotz's
                    page had been co-opted by a sprawling ad account network

                    The network, which uses the name Patriot Democracy on many
                    of its ad accounts, is one of eight deceptive Meta
                    advertising operations identified by ProPublica and Tow.
                    These networks have collectively controlled more than 340
                    Facebook pages, as well as associated Instagram and
                    Messenger accounts. Most were created by the advertising
                    networks, with some pages masquerading as government
                    entities. Others were verified pages of people with public
                    roles, like Klotz, who had been hacked. The networks have
                    placed more than 160,000 election and social issues ads on
                    these pages in English and Spanish. Meta showed the ads to
                    users nearly 900 million times across Facebook and
                    Instagram.<br />[..]<br />Most of these networks are run by
                    lead-generation companies, which gather and sell people's

                    ads were unwittingly signed up for monthly credit card
                    charges, among many other schemes. Some, for example, were
                    conned by an unscrupulous insurance agent into changing
                    their Affordable Care Act health plans. While the agent
                    earns a commission, the people who are scammed can lose
                    their health insurance or face unexpected tax bills because
                    of the switch.

                    The ads run by the networks employ tactics that Meta has

                    video of national political figures and promoting misleading
                    claims about government programs to bait people into sharing
                    personal information. Thousands of ads illegally displayed
                    copies of state and county seals and the images of governors
                    to trick users. "The State has recently approved that

                    up to $35,000 of Funeral Expense Insurance to cover any and

                    >. With seven-year update commitments from some Android
                    phone manufacturers, the onus is now on us to stop our
                    batteries from degrading too far.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What was most striking to us about the results of this poll
                    was that less than 12% of you don’t use any battery
                    management tricks at all. With battery degradation being a
                    slow and subtle process, we assumed that many more people
                    wouldn’t consider it. But hey, we should have given our
                    tech-savvy readers more credit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While it’s clear that you do indeed take battery health
                    seriously, there isn’t a consensus amongst the responses on
                    the best way to address it. Almost 33% of you follow the
                    advice to only charge the battery to 80% full, while
                    slightly more of you use adaptive charging. The latter
                    approach intelligently slows the charging process based on
                    usage patterns to reduce battery wear and extend its overall
                    lifespan. This could include fast charging to around 80%,
                    then slowly topping up from there when you’re not in a hurry
                    to unplug. 7.6% of you suggest you use two or more of these
                    tricks, which is a real dedication to getting the most out
                    of your battery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you don’t use any battery management tricks and you’re
                    keen to start now, it’s worth checking out the battery
                    settings in your device. It only takes 30 seconds and could
                    keep your battery healthy for another six months.

                janrinok: I charge my 'phone when the battery is getting low,
                usually overnight, and in the morning it is 100%. I purchased my
                'phone in 2016 and it is still using the original battery. It
                might (and I am not certain) just be beginning to lose a
                fraction of its charge over a 2 day period. Do you use a special
                charging cycle? How long does a battery normally last you? And
                do you replace the battery or just upgrade to the latest and
                greatest on the market?

                    Instead, SDOs are asking Congress to rewrite the
                    Constitution and affirm that SDOs retain copyright in their
                    standards no matter what a federal regulator does, as long
                    as they make them available online. We know what that means
                    because the SDOs have already created "reading rooms" for
                    some of their standards, and they show us that the SDOs'
                    idea of "making available" is "making available as if it was
                    1999." The texts are not searchable, cannot be printed,
                    downloaded, highlighted, or bookmarked for later viewing,
                    and cannot be magnified without becoming blurry.
                    Cross-referencing and comparison is virtually impossible.
                    Often, a reader can view only a portion of each page at a
                    time and, upon zooming in, must scroll from right to left to
                    read a single line of text. As if that wasn't bad enough,
                    these reading rooms are inaccessible to print-disabled
                    people altogether..

                  <p>
                    It's a bad bargain that would trade our fundamental due
                    process rights in exchange for a pinky promise of highly
                    restricted access to the law. But if Congress takes that
                    step, it's a comfort to know that we can take the fight back
                    to the courts and trust that judges, if not legislators,
                    understand why laws are facts, not property, and should be
                    free for all to access, read, and share.

                    [...] This is the promise of the Fediverse: You use whatever
                    social network you want to use and connect with people on
                    whatever social network they want to use. And there are a
                    few other perks. When I quit using Twitter a couple years
                    ago (before it became X), I left all of my followers behind.
                    That's not how it works with the Fediverse: You can switch
                    from one service to another and take your followers with
                    you. That's the kind of freedom you can't get from a
                    centralized system.

                  <p>
                    [...] All of this is possible because the Fediverse is based
                    on an open protocol that anyone can build on. The hope is
                    that, over time, more services will offer integrations and
                    social networking will become as open as email. Is that what
                    will happen for sure? I don't know. And the Fediverse, like
                    anything that exists on the internet, has its share of
                    problems. Moderation, for example, is a huge challenge, and
                    bigger platforms moving into the space could make it harder.

                    I'm only scratching the service with this
                    explanation—there's so much more I could dig into. For the
                    most part, though, when you hear "the Fediverse" you'll now
                    know what it means: a series of social networks and
                    platforms that are connected to each other. You'll hopefully
                    hear a lot more about it in the years to come.

                kicked the bucket (who?), and nary a mention in the press. But
                then, perhaps most Linux followers today where not alive or old
                enough to have experienced Mr. McBride's assault on Linux that
                could have very well ended it's life as Open Source. Of course
                I'm talking about way back in the Stone Age when

                for ownership of the Linux kernel. Those of us who were around
                followed the now defuncted Groklaw for the latest dirt on this
                legal entanglement that is now for the most part forgotten.
              </p>
              <p>From the wikipedia link:</p>

                    McBride has been controversial in the information technology
                    industry for his role as the CEO of SCO in asserting broad
                    claims of intellectual property ownership of the various
                    UNIX operating systems derivatives developed by IBM under a
                    license originally granted by AT&amp;T Corporation. Open
                    source, free software and Linux developers and supporters,
                    and the computer industry at large have been outspoken and
                    highly critical and skeptical of McBride and SCO's claims in
                    these areas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ty Mattingly, a former Novell Executive Vice President and
                    co-worker of McBride was quoted as saying, "Congratulations.
                    In a few short months you've dethroned Bill Gates as the
                    most hated man in the industry."[6] McBride claimed he
                    received death threats as a result of the SCO-IBM lawsuits,
                    and had a package of worms mailed to his home, prompting him
                    to carry a firearm and to employ multiple bodyguards.[4]
                    During an interview, when asked about the popularity of the
                    lawsuit against IBM, McBride answered: "We're either right
                    or we're not. If we're wrong, we deserve people throwing
                    rocks at us."[7]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under McBride's leadership, SCO saw a surge in stock price
                    from under $2 in March 2003 to over $20 just six months
                    later. Following several adverse rulings issued by the
                    United States District Court in Utah, SCO's stock value
                    dropped to under $1. On April 27, 2007, NASDAQ served notice
                    that the company would be delisted if SCO's stock price did
                    not increase above $1 for a minimum of 10 consecutive days
                    over the course of 180 business days, ending October 22,
                    2007.[8]

                    [...] The other, and potentially bigger, problem is the

                    It's easy to laugh and think this is just Google being
                    Google again, but this is a serious problem. By pricing
                    these phones so high, people aren't going to buy them.
                    Google isn't going to keep them forever, and in the end,
                    they end up being stripped of any material that's easy to
                    get while the rest goes into a landfill.

                    [...] Google can afford to sell these refurbs dirt cheap and
                    it gets even more eyeballs on Google's services so Google
                    makes even more money selling ads. I don't know why the

                    The main contribution in the September paper is the process
                    the researchers used to find integral distinguishers in up
                    to nine rounds of the three previously mentioned algorithms.

                    [...] The paper makes no reference to AES or RSA and never
                    claims to break anything. Instead, it describes a way to use
                    D-Wave-enabled quantum annealing to find the integral
                    distinguisher. Classical attacks have had the optimized
                    capability to find the same integral distinguishers for
                    years. David Jao, a professor specializing in PQC at the
                    University of Waterloo in Canada, likened the research to
                    finding a new lock-picking technique. The end result is the
                    same, but the method is new.

                    used encryption algorithms.

                    coverage by the same publication that claimed researchers
                    found a factorization method that could break a 2,048-bit
                    RSA key using a quantum system with just 372 qubits. People
                    who follow PQC should be especially wary when seeking news
                    there.

                  <p>
                    The coverage of the September paper is especially overblown
                    because symmetric encryption, unlike RSA and other
                    asymmetric siblings, is are widely belived to be safe from
                    quantum computing, as long as bit sizes are sufficient. PQC
                    experts are confident that AES-256 will resist all known
                    quantum attacks.

                  <p>
                    [...] As a reminder, current estimates are that quantum
                    cracking of a single 2048-bit RSA key would require a
                    computer with 20 million qubits running in superposition for
                    about eight hours. For context, quantum computers maxed out
                    at 433 qubits in 2022 and 1,000 qubits last year. (A qubit
                    is a basic unit of quantum computing, analogous to the
                    binary bit in classical computing. Comparisons between
                    qubits in true quantum systems and quantum annealers aren't
                    uniform.) So even when quantum computing matures
                    sufficiently to break vulnerable algorithms, it could take
                    decades or longer before the majority of keys are cracked.

                    The upshot of this latest episode is that while quantum
                    computing will almost undoubtedly topple many of the most
                    widely used forms of encryption used today, that calamitous
                    event won't happen anytime soon. It's important that
                    industries and researchers move swiftly to devise
                    quantum-resistant algorithms and implement them widely. At
                    the same time, people should take steps not to get
                    steamrolled by the PQC hype train.

                    AT&amp;T improperly obtained money from a government-run
                    broadband discount program by submitting duplicate requests
                    and by claiming subsidies for thousands of subscribers who
                    weren't using AT&amp;T's service. AT&amp;T obtained funding
                    based on false certifications it made under penalty of

                    The settlement fully resolves the FCC investigation into

                    formed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to the
                    EBB's successor program, the Affordable Connectivity Program

                    We contacted AT&amp;T today and asked for an explanation of
                    what caused the violations. Instead, AT&amp;T provided Ars
                    with a statement that praised itself for participating in
                    the federal discount programs.

                    quickly implemented both programs to provide more low-cost

                A Russia court claims that Google currently owes them 2000000
                0000000000 0000000000 0000000000, or 2 undecillion if you will
                -- a number with 36 trailing zeros, rubles.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is due to a fine of 100 000 rubles per day exponentially
                growing since sometimes in 2021 due to Google blocking various
                Russian sites from Youtube.
              </p>
              <p>
                The slight problem is that the fine is now so large that it is
                many, many, times the entire worlds combined GDP. I don't think
                they should expect to get paid anytime soon.

                    arrest. So the researchers, based primarily at Sun Yat-Sen
                    University, decided to test whether keeping the livers of
                    Tibetan minipigs functionally alive could have a positive
                    effect on their brains’ survivability after resuscitation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All of the pigs had blood flow to their brains stopped, but
                    some were hooked up to a life support system that kept their
                    liver’s circulation going. The scientists then tried to
                    revive the pigs’ brains after a certain period of time using
                    the same life support system. Afterward, the pigs were
                    euthanized and compared to a control group of pigs that had
                    their blood flow left alone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the pigs had blood flow to both organs shut down, their
                    brains were substantially more damaged following
                    resuscitation, the researchers found. But the brains of pigs
                    that had their livers supported tended to fare much better,
                    with fewer signs of injury and a restoration of electrical
                    activity that lasted up to six hours. The researchers were
                    also able to restore brain activity in these pigs up to 50
                    minutes after blood flow to the brain was stopped.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Of course, this doesn’t mean that scientists can now
                    return anyone back from the dead perfectly intact with just
                    a little boost to their liver. There are many damaging
                    bodily changes that occur soon after a cardiac arrest, not
                    just those in the brain and liver. And certainly more
                    research will have to be done to confirm the team’s
                    conclusions that the liver is critical to restored brain
                    function. But if this work does continue to pay off, it
                    could someday lead to practical interventions that improve
                    the odds of successful resuscitation in people.

                    [...] That's not to say all the big-name AI companies are
                    lying about their open source street cred. For example,
                    <a

                    really are open source under the Apache 2 license.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Why is this important? Why do people like me insist that we
                    properly use the term open source? It's not like, after all,
                    the OSI is a government or regulatory organization. It's
                    not. It's just a nonprofit that has created some very useful
                    guidelines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] If we need to check every license for every bit of
                    code, "developers are going to go to legal reviews every
                    time you want to use a new library. Companies are going to
                    be scared to publish things on the internet if they're not
                    clear about the liabilities they're encountering when that
                    source code becomes public."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lorenc continued: "You might think this is only a big
                    company problem, but it's not. It's a shared problem.
                    Everybody who uses open source is going to be affected by
                    this. It could cause entire projects to stop working.
                    Security bugs aren't going to get fixed. Maintenance is
                    going to get a lot harder. We must act together to preserve
                    and defend the definition of open source. Otherwise, the
                    lawyers are going to have to come back. No one wants the
                    lawyers to come back."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I must add that I know a lot of IP lawyers. They do not need
                    or want these headaches. Real open source licenses make life
                    easier for everyone: businesses, programmers, and lawyers.
                    Introducing "open except for someone who might compete with
                    us" or "open except for someone who might deploy the code on
                    a cloud" is just asking for trouble.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the end, open washing will dirty the legal, business, and
                    development work for everyone. Including, ironically, the
                    shortsighted companies now supporting this approach. After
                    all, almost all their work, especially in

                    The other thing is that in order to learn, children need to
                    have fun. But they have fun by really being pushed to
                    explore and create and make new things that are personally
                    meaningful. So you need open-ended environments that allow
                    children to explore and express themselves.

                Being able to code is a new literacy, remarks Professor Bers,
                and like with reading and writing, we need to adapt our learning
                tools to children's developmental ages. One idea here is that of
                a "coding playground" where it's not about following
                step-by-step plans, but about inventing games, pretend play and
                creating anything children can imagine. She is currently working
                on
                <a href="https://sites.bc.edu/devtech/smart-playgrounds/"
                  >a project</a
                >
                to bring such a playground <i>outside</i>: integrating motors,
                sensors and other devices in physical playgrounds, "to bolster
                computational thinking through play".
              </p>
              <p>
                Given how fast complicated toys are being thrown aside by young
                children, in contrast to a simple ball -- or a meccano set, for
                the engineering types -- I have my doubts.
              </p>
              <p>
                At least one of the tools mentioned above is aimed at toddlers.
                So put aside your model steam locomotive, oh fellow 'lentil, and
                advice me: from what age do you think we should try to steer
                kids into "coding" or "developing", and which tools should or
                could be used for this?
              </p>

                    A new study reveals it would take far longer than the
                    lifespan of our universe for a typing monkey to randomly
                    produce Shakespeare. So, while the Infinite Monkey Theorem
                    is true, it is also somewhat misleading.

                    A monkey randomly pressing keys on a typewriter for an
                    infinite amount of time would eventually type out the
                    complete works of Shakespeare purely by chance, according to
                    the Infinite Monkey Theorem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This widely known thought experiment is used to help us
                    understand the principles of probability and randomness, and
                    how chance can lead to unexpected outcomes. The idea has
                    been referenced in pop culture from "The Simpsons" to "The
                    Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and on TikTok.

                    However, a new study reveals it would take an unbelievably
                    huge amount of time—far longer than the lifespan of our
                    universe, for a typing monkey to randomly produce
                    Shakespeare. So, while the theorem is true, it is also
                    somewhat misleading.

                    Voyager 1 can't seem to catch a break. The interstellar
                    traveler recently recovered from a thruster glitch that
                    nearly ended its mission, and now NASA's aging probe stopped
                    sending data to ground control due to an unknown issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Monday, NASA
                    <a
                      href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/voyager/2024/10/28/after-pause-nasas-voyager-1-communicating-with-mission-team/"

                    that Voyager 1 recently experienced a brief pause in
                    communication after turning off one of its radio
                    transmitters. The space agency is now relying on a second
                    radio transmitter that hasn't been used since 1981 to
                    communicate with Voyager 1 until engineers can figure out
                    the underlying issue behind the glitch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The flight team behind the mission first realized something
                    was amiss with Voyager 1's communication when the spacecraft
                    failed to respond to a command. On October 16, the team used
                    NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN)—a global array of giant
                    radio antennas—to beam instructions to Voyager 1, directing
                    it to turn on one of its heaters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Voyager 1 should've sent back engineering data for the team
                    to determine how the spacecraft responded to the command.
                    This process normally takes a couple of days, as the command
                    takes about 23 hours to travel more than 15 billion miles
                    (24 billion kilometers) to the spacecraft and another 23
                    hours for the flight team to receive a signal back. Instead,
                    the command seems to have triggered the spacecraft's fault
                    protection system, which autonomously responds to onboard
                    issues affecting the mission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spacecraft's fault protection system lowered the rate at
                    which its radio transmitter was sending back data to use
                    less power, according to NASA. However, while conserving the
                    spacecraft's power, this mode also changes the X-band radio
                    signal, a frequency range within the electromagnetic
                    spectrum that the DSN's antennas listen for.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The flight team was able to locate the signal a day later
                    but then, on October 19, communication with Voyager 1
                    stopped entirely. Voyager 1's fault protection system
                    appeared to have been triggered twice more, and it turned
                    off the X-band transmitter altogether. The spacecraft
                    switched to a second radio transmitter called the S-band,
                    which uses less power but transmits a significantly fainter
                    signal. Voyager 1's S-band transmitter hadn't been used
                    since 1981, and the flight team was not sure its signal
                    could be detected due to the spacecraft being much farther
                    away today than it was 43 years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the team of engineers didn't want to risk sending
                    another signal to the X-band transmitter, and decided to
                    give it a shot. On October 22, the team sent a command to
                    confirm whether the S-band transmitter is working and was
                    finally able to reconnect with Voyager 1 two days later.
                    NASA engineers are currently working to determine what may
                    have triggered the spacecraft's fault protection system in
                    its attempt to resolve the issue.

                    Voyager 1 launched in 1977, less than a month after its twin
                    probe, Voyager 2, began its journey to space. The spacecraft
                    took a faster route, exiting the asteroid belt earlier than
                    its twin and making close encounters with Jupiter and
                    Saturn. Along the way, it discovered two Jovian moons, Thebe
                    and Metis, as well as five new moons and a new ring called
                    the G-ring around Saturn. Voyager 1 ventured into
                    interstellar space in August 2012, becoming the first
                    spacecraft to cross the boundary of our solar system.

                    The spacecraft has been flying for 47 years, and all that
                    time in deep space has taken a toll on the interstellar
                    probe. NASA engineers have had to come up with creative ways
                    to keep the iconic mission alive. The team recently

                    using a delicate procedure to preserve Voyager 1's power.

                  <p>
                    Voyager 1 is no spring chicken, and its upkeep has not been
                    an easy task over the years, especially from billions of
                    miles away. But all-in-all, humanity's long-standing
                    interstellar probe is well worth the effort.

                    As far as regulatory efforts go, it’s not the worst idea.
                    Transparency is lacking in broadband land, and U.S.
                    broadband and cable companies have a 30+ year history of
                    ripping off consumers with an absolute cavalcade of weird
                    restrictions, fees, surcharges, and connection limitations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here’s the thing though:
                    <em
                      >transparently knowing you’re being ripped off doesn’t
                      necessarily stop you from being ripped off</em
                    >. A huge number of Americans live under a broadband
                    monopoly or duopoly, meaning they have no other choice in
                    broadband access. As such, Comcast or AT&amp;T or Verizon
                    can rip you off, and you have absolutely no alternative
                    options that allow you to vote with your wallet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That wouldn’t be as much of a problem if U.S. federal
                    regulators had any interest in reining in regional telecom
                    monopoly power, but they don’t. In fact, members of both
                    parties are historically incapable of even admitting
                    monopoly harm exists. Democrats are notably better at at
                    least trying to do something, even if that something often
                    winds up being decorative regulatory theater.

                    The other problem: with the help of a corrupt Supreme Court,
                    telecoms and their Republican and libertarian besties are
                    currently engaged in an effort to

                    >
                    under the pretense this unleashes “free market innovation.”
                    It, of course, doesn’t; regional monopolies like Comcast
                    just double down on all of their worst impulses, unchecked.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If successful, even fairly basic efforts like this one won’t
                    be spared, as the FCC won’t have the authority to enforce
                    much of anything.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It’s all very demonstrative of a U.S. telecom industry
                    that’s been broken by monopoly power, a lack of competition,
                    and regulatory capture. As a result, even the most basic
                    attempts at consumer protection are constantly undermined by
                    folks who’ve dressed up greed as some
                    <em>elaborate and intellectual ethos</em>.

                Rich countries are countries which have accumulated superior
                knowledge for producing highly-complex leading edge
                technologies. With that go successful enterprises and high pay,
                high quality jobs, and a more diversified economy. Diverting
                money into manufacturing does not need to harm other sectors of
                the economy: look at Silicon Valley. Now the global software
                powerhouse, it started with manufacturing transistors.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Acts passed during this Administration do help: the private
                sector invested approximately $80bn into manufacturing
                construction in 2019; in 2024 that has increased to an
                annualized $220bn.
              </p>
              <p>
                The other two witnesses -- both connected to the Cato Institute
                -- have a different outlook though. Policies where you target
                specific sectors of the economy rarely work, they claim. They
                are bound to stimulate waste and corruption, and direct funds
                away from companies who really could use them: and that's
                without even talking about fiscal deficits and such. Better turn
                those funds towards generalized tax reductions, which will
                ultimately stimulate more investment into the broader economy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, one should take into account the reaction of the outside
                world here: the EU is already working on its own industrial
                policies, largely in response to the Biden Administration's
                Acts. We might very well end-up in a zero-sum game, where the
                only benefactors are a range of companies which are artificially
                kept alive with grant money.
              </p>

                Now, dear reader, it may come as a surprise to you, but you have
                just been urgently asked -- by a prominent US Presidential
                Candidate -- to give your advice on a

                    A group of researchers in the UK affiliated with the BSS
                    (British Sleep Society) published a
                    <a
                      href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsr.14352"

                    >
                    this week calling for the permanent abolition of Daylight
                    Saving Time (DST) and adherence to Greenwich Mean Time
                    (GMT), in large part because modern evidence suggests having
                    that extra hour of sunlight in the evenings is worse for our
                    health than we thought back in the 1970s when the concept
                    was all the rage in Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not only does GMT more closely align with the natural
                    day/light cycle in the UK, the boffins assert, but decades
                    of research into sleep and circadian rhythms have been
                    produced since DST was enacted that have yet to be
                    considered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The human circadian rhythm, the 24-hour cycle our bodies go
                    through, drives a lot about our health beyond sleep. It
                    regulates hormone release, gene expression, metabolism, mood
                    (who isn't grumpier when waking up in January?), and the
                    like. In short, it's important. Messing with that rhythm by
                    forcing ourselves out of bed earlier for several months out
                    of the year can have lasting effects, the researchers said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to their review of recent research, having light
                    trigger our circadian rhythms in the mornings to wake us up
                    is far more important than an extra hour of light in the
                    evenings. In fact, contrary to the belief that an extra hour
                    of light in the evenings is beneficial, it might actually
                    cause health problems by, again, mucking about with the
                    human body's understanding of what time it is and how we
                    ought to feel about it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Disruption of the daily synchronization of our body clocks
                    causes disturbances in our physiology and behavior … which
                    leads to negative short and long-term physical and mental
                    health outcomes," the authors said.

                  <p>
                    That, and we've just plain fooled ourselves into thinking it
                    benefits us in any real way.

                    The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has
                    finalized a rule that requires banks, credit card issuers,
                    and most other financial firms to provide consumers with
                    access to their personal financial data - and to help them
                    transfer it, generally at no cost.

                    The rule also outlines required privacy protections for

                    Despite an official ban on Russian government workers using

                    government staff from using iPhones. Purportedly, it was
                    because the FSB believed the US was using the iPhone for
                    eavesdropping.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now according to <em>Reuters</em>, local Russian sources

                    the ban rather failed. While the figures have yet to be
                    confirmed by any other source, the
                    <em>Vedomosti</em> business daily claims that purchases of
                    iPhones from January 2024 to September would four times
                    higher year over year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] That rather dispels any idea that Russian officials
                    are rebelling against the ban en masse. But it also points
                    to how the original ban was seemingly far from a blanket
                    one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Equally, that destroys the idea that the FSB can be serious
                    in its allegations of iPhone wiretapping. It's always been
                    more likely that any ban is a retaliation for how Apple

                    a new type of optical memory that stores data by
                    transferring light from rare-earth element atoms embedded in
                    a solid material to nearby quantum defects. They

                      >published</a

                    their study in Physical Review Research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem that the researchers aim to solve is the
                    diffraction limit of light in standard CDs and DVDs. Current
                    optical storage has a hard cap on data density because each
                    single bit can't be smaller than the wavelength of the
                    reading/writing laser.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers propose bypassing this limit by stuffing the
                    material with rare-earth emitters, such as magnesium oxide
                    (MgO) crystals. The trick, called wavelength multiplexing,
                    involves having each emitter use a slightly different
                    wavelength of light. They theorized that this would allow
                    cramming far more data into the same storage footprint.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers first had to tackle the physics and model
                    all the requirements to build a proof of concept. They
                    simulated a theoretical solid material filled with
                    rare-earth atoms that absorb and re-emit light. The models
                    then showed how the nearby quantum defects could capture and
                    store the returned light.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the fundamental discoveries was that when a defect
                    absorbs the narrow wavelength energy from those nearby
                    atoms, it doesn't just get excited – its spin state flips.
                    Once it flips, it is nearly impossible to revert, meaning
                    those defects could legitimately store data for a long time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While it's a promising first step, some crucial questions
                    still need answers. For example, verifying how long those
                    excited states persist is essential. Details were also light
                    on capacity estimates – the scientists touted
                    "ultra-high-density" but didn't provide any projections
                    against current disc capacities. Yet, despite the remaining
                    hurdles, the researchers are hyped, calling it a "huge first
                    step."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, turning all this into an actual commercial
                    storage product will likely take years of additional
                    research and development.

                    [...] As of this writing, asking Google for the best steak,
                    steakhouse, or steak sandwich in London (or similar) isn't
                    generating an AI Overview result for me. But when I searched
                    for the best steak sandwich in London, the top result is
                    from Reddit, including a thread from four days ago titled
                    "Which Angus Steakhouse do you recommend for their steak
                    sandwich?" and one from two days ago titled "Had to see what

                    dangerous attempt to manipulate search results or AI
                    algorithms, it does highlight the pitfalls of Google results
                    becoming dependent on content generated by users who could

                    online users, including on platforms outside of Reddit, have
                    publicly declared plans to make inaccurate or misleading
                    posts in an effort to thwart AI scrapers.

                    This also presents an interesting position for Reddit, which
                    is banking heavily on AI deals to help it become profitable.

                    Steve Huffman said that he believes Reddit has some of the
                    world's best AI training data.

                  <p>
                    When asked if he fears "low quality, shallow content
                    generated by AI" will make its way onto Reddit, Huffman
                    answered, in part, that the source of AI is "actual
                    intelligence," and that "there's a general lowering of
                    quality on the internet because more content is written by
                    AI. But I think that actually makes Reddit stand out more as
                    the place where there's all of this human content. What
                    people want is to hear from other people."

                    Not all winged dinosaurs were necessarily capable of full
                    flight, but this anatomical feature may have enabled them to
                    travel further by flapping or gliding

                    Tiny tracks in South Korea symbolise a moment 120 million
                    years ago when a dinosaur took advantage of its wings to
                    cover ground in large leaps – the oldest track evidence of
                    wing-assisted movement in these extinct

                    Whether the creature, which was a raptor and not part of the
                    lineage that led to birds, took full flight is uncertain.
                    But the tracks support previous ideas that aerodynamics
                    evolved multiple times across prehistoric lines, says

                    “It’s pretty rare to find these kinds of [pre-flight]
                    tracks, and then to find them in an animal that’s not even a
                    bird – that’s pretty special,” he says.

                    Velociraptors and other raptors (dromaeosaurids) are the
                    ancestors of modern birds, but their lineage split into
                    avian and non-avian, or “paravian”, lines about 170 million
                    years ago. Despite having feathers and wings, paravian
                    dinosaurs generally seemed to lack the wingspan needed to
                    offset their body weight, says team member

                      >suspected that some paravian dinosaurs could fly</a
                    >, or at least glide, before full flight evolved in birds,
                    based on muscles in their upper bodies. That suspicion grew
                    stronger as they investigated more than 2600 rows of
                    dinosaur tracks around the world.

                  <p>
                    One set of tracks, discovered during the construction of a
                    shopping centre in south-eastern South Korea, showed
                    surprisingly long spacing

                    [...] Further calculations and comparisons with fossil
                    anatomy suggested he was right: the animal could not have
                    made that stride with its legs alone. It was clearly
                    flapping or gliding, possibly while launching or landing,
                    says Pittman.

                    “I think the vast majority of feathered dinosaurs were
                    probably doing what this guy was doing – using the wings to
                    augment running, jumping, braking and turning,” says
                    Pittman.

                    [...] In September, Ono and two collaborators — William
                    Craig and Jan-Willem van Ittersum — published
                    <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2409417121"

                    for partition identities. Rather than looking for a new
                    source from which these identities would spring, they were
                    able to use them for an entirely different purpose: to
                    detect prime numbers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They took functions that counted partitions and used them to
                    build a special formula. When you plug any prime number into
                    this equation, it spits out zero. When you plug in any other
                    number, it instead spits out a positive number. In this way,
                    the partition identities can give you a way to pick out the
                    entire set of primes from the integers, Ono said. “Isn’t
                    that crazy?”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Partitions are about adding and counting,” he said. “Why
                    would they be able to detect which numbers are prime or not,
                    on the nose, which is a multiplication thing?”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By tapping into the rich mathematical theory of
                    <a
                      href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/behold-modular-forms-the-fifth-fundamental-operation-of-math-20230921/"
                      >modular forms</a
                    >, he and his colleagues found that this formula was just a
                    glimpse of a much larger class of prime-detecting functions
                    — infinitely many, in fact. “That’s mind-blowing to me,” Ono
                    said. “I hope people find it beautiful.” It indicates a
                    deeper relation between the partitions and multiplicative
                    number theory that mathematicians are now hoping to explore.

                    In some ways, it makes sense that partitions keep
                    infiltrating every corner of mathematics. “The theory of
                    partitions is so basic,” Andrews said. “Counting stuff and
                    adding stuff up happens in almost every branch of
                    mathematics.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the precise nature of those connections is hard to
                    work out. “It’s really about getting the perspective right,”
                    Ono said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “This is the great thing about Ramanujan’s work,” Kanade
                    said. “It’s not just one identity he discovered, and a dead
                    end. It’s always the tip of an iceberg. You just have to
                    follow it through.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Ramanujan is someone who can imagine things that someone
                    like me cannot,” Mourtada said. But the development of new
                    fields of mathematics has “given us the possibility to find
                    new partition identities that Ramanujan could probably have
                    found just by imagination.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “That’s why mathematics is so important,” he added. “It
                    allows ordinary people like me to find these miracles, too.”

                    to require unlocking of phones within 60 days of activation,
                    claiming that locking phones to a carrier's network makes it
                    possible to provide cheaper handsets to consumers. "If the

                    "consumers risk losing access to the benefits of free or
                    heavily subsidized handsets because the proposal would force

                    after a consumer's handset is activated with the provider,

                    Scientists in China have created a mind-bogglingly powerful
                    resistive magnet that has officially broken the world record
                    by sustaining an incredible 42.02 tesla. That is over
                    800,000 times stronger than the magnetic field produced by
                    Earth itself, which has a flux density of about 50
                    microtesla.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new record was set on September 22 at the Steady High
                    Magnetic Field Facility (SHMFF) in Hefei, narrowly edging
                    out the previous record of 41.4 tesla held by another
                    resistive magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Lab in
                    Florida since 2017.

                    As for why scientists are so determined to push the limits
                    of magnetism, physicist Joachim Wosnitza from Germany's
                    Dresden lab
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03382-6"

                    that it opens up all kinds of bizarre new realms of physics
                    to explore. Essentially, the stronger the magnetism, the
                    greater the chances of discovering new states of matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another physicist noted that high magnetism allows
                    scientists to engineer and manipulate entirely new phases of
                    matter that simply don't exist under normal conditions. Each
                    additional tesla achieved also makes instruments
                    exponentially more sensitive for detecting faint phenomena.

                  <p>
                    The SHMFF's new champion is available for international
                    researchers to test on advanced materials like
                    superconductors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The only drawback of such resistive magnetic systems is that
                    they are real power hogs. The SHMFF's creation consumed a
                    staggering 32.3 megawatts to achieve that record. However,
                    scientists continue to use them because they can sustain
                    high magnetic fields much longer than their newer
                    superconducting counterparts, which eventually reach their
                    limits. The older magnets can also be ramped up quickly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nonetheless, the enormous power requirements are a
                    significant problem. Therefore, teams like those at the
                    SHMFF are also working on hybrid and fully superconducting
                    designs that could achieve extreme strengths while consuming
                    much less energy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is not to say that hybrid or superconducting designs
                    are less powerful than resistive magnetic systems. In fact,
                    China debuted a hybrid resistive/superconducting magnet in
                    2022 that achieved a 45.22 tesla field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the other side of the world, the US National Lab's mini
                    superconducting prototype managed a brief 45.5 tesla burst
                    back in 2019. However, making these new low-power systems
                    reliable and affordable – while also keeping them cool –
                    remains a major technical challenge, underscoring the
                    continued need for resistive magnets.

                Over the coming days and weeks we will be switching servers from
                Linode to our own hardware. The first switch will take place
                tomorrow. This will also require some DNS changes but you just
                keep using the same URLs that you are using today. Other than
                that services should look and behave exactly as they do now.
                There may well be minor disruptions to connections and we ask
                you to please bear with us if they occur. There will be pauses
                of a day or more in between each service being switched over,
                while we continue to monitor that everything is working as
                expected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moving the data from a live server to a new server means that
                there will be a finite time between making a backup and
                installing it on the new server. The site will indicate that
                maintenance is being carried out. That implies that posts made
                during this interval will be lost. The process will begin around
                1600 UTC on Monday 28 October. We will attempt to make the
                switch over as quickly as possible and there should always be a
                live server online. If you lose access to the site completely
                remember that you can still contact us via email ('nickname' [@]
                soylentnews.org), on IRC, or by shouting VERY loudly.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your comment is lost please do not believe those in the
                community who will no doubt claim that comments are being
                intentionally deleted. They are not (unless you are one of our
                small number of persistent spammers).
              </p>
              <p>
                Once each switch is completed I would hope that we can inform
                you immediately. However, that might not always be possible -
                everyone has to sleep sometime! Please make any observations
                regarding problems, or even compliments if the system is
                responding better than before, in the comments for this Meta.
                However, our testing so far indicates that the new servers are
                more responsive than the existing servers but of course they
                have not yet been placed under quite the same load.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>UPDATE</b>: You should all be accessing the new server.
                Please let us know if you experience any problems. A big
                thank-you to kolie!.

                    For the first time ever, a well-known auction house is
                    selling an artwork that was painted by a robot. Sotheby's
                    will be auctioning off the portrait of scientist Alan Turing
                    and it could fetch as much as £150,000.

                    works by deploying AI algorithms and has cameras in its

                Ultra-realistic? Looks more like someone got lost in the uncanny
                valley, or got very poor taste in women. It's apparently
                important to note that it is a (or resembles) human female. Not
                one of those disgusting manbots artistic AI fueled robots. How
                does female robots differ from male robots anyway? 0s or 1s ?
