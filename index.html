                Long story short this adds an 2D barcode to product labels
                alongside the existing 1D barcode. The 2D barcode gives extra
                info to the retailer (assuming the manufacturer adds it to the
                barcode) like batch/lot #, expiry date etc and can also provide
                a URL for the product to the consumer where they can find out
                more info about the product. There's even a complete fake brand
                set up to show off the concept -
                <a href="https://dalgiardino.com/">https://dalgiardino.com/</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                Since most POS apps are likely going to be confused by 2
                barcodes on 1 product and potentially double-charge you for your
                favourite box of cornflakes the scanner vendors are implementing
                a feature where they'll only send 1 barcode to the POS system;
                for legacy scanners that'll be the 1D barcode (like now), for
                new scanners that can read 2D barcodes it can either be specific
                GS1 tags or the entire barcode depending on what the POS
                application wants.

                Note that this is already live for some manufacturers and
                geographies, 2027 is just when it's intended to be deployed
                globally.

                    The relevance of a quiet aircraft to the DOD is likely
                    obvious. Whisper has validated that it can fly a 55-pound
                    drone with its electric-ducted fan at an altitude of 200
                    feet that is completely undetectable, at least by noise,
                    from the ground. To put that in context, Moore said Boeing's
                    popular military drone, the Insitu ScanEagle, would need to
                    fly at least 3,000 feet above to not be heard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's sort of a breakthrough in terms of what surveillance
                    drones are capable of doing in terms of missions, by being
                    able to get so close and not be detected," Moore said.
                    "Especially at night, where you won't be able to see it. It
                    can be flying and loitering right overhead and you would
                    have no idea that's there."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The company is quick to point out that the benefits
                    don't just lie in decreased noise, but also in the
                    efficiency gains – a metric that's all the more important as
                    more of the world's technologies switch to electric, and
                    must depend on the limited lifespan of batteries. The
                    company also says that many aircraft have speeds that are
                    limited by open rotors (or open propellors), as opposed to
                    ducted. Instead of operating at 150 miles per hour, an eVTOL
                    could potentially fly as fast as 300-400 miles per hour.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We are this future Pratt &amp; Whitney mashed up with
                    a Dyson," Moore said, referring to the giant aircraft engine
                    maker and the consumer tech company best known for its
                    vacuums and hair dryers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We're very anxious to take this technology to people's
                    everyday life."

                    Camp says the discovery was a far cry from the malware he
                    typically studies, and a lot less work for an attacker who
                    happened upon one of these unwiped routers. "I don't need a
                    zero day, I have your router," quips Camp.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Meanwhile, one of the unwiped routers contained what
                    Camp describes as a "creepy" remote administration
                    interface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I was never sure if it was on purpose, but it was creepy,
                    very low-level access, and from one of the countries with
                    flags that we're [the US] not happy with right now," he
                    says. "It could be totally legit or that could be really
                    bad. It was a little edgy to me."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] So how do you wipe a router that you want to retire?
                    The good news is most routers are fairly easy to securely
                    decommission, and the big three Cisco, Fortinet, and Juniper
                    on their websites provide detailed guidelines for restoring
                    devices to their factory default settings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And if your organization already had disposed of
                    routers that weren't properly wiped, Eset recommends
                    rotating cryptographic keys in case an attacker were to get
                    their hands on your old router and attempt to gain trusted
                    access to your network. Zero trust can help here as well,
                    they say.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] If you buy a secondhand core router, and like the
                    researchers find that it still contains the previous owner's
                    information, Eset recommends disconnecting the router and
                    moving it to a secured area and contact your regional CISA
                    office. They also say it's best to document your purchase
                    process as a precaution for insurance or legal purposes.

                    A retired NASA spacecraft will reenter Earth's atmosphere on
                    Wednesday, with some parts of the vehicle expected to crash
                    to the planet's surface.

                    While most of the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar
                    Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) spacecraft is expected to burn
                    up as it enters the atmosphere at high speed, some parts of
                    the 660-pound (300-kilogram) machine are likely to survive
                    the descent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The good news is that

                    that the risk of harm coming to folks on terra firma is low
                    at "approximately 1 in 2,467." Still, for anyone wishing to
                    don a hard hat just in case, RHESSI is expected to reenter
                    the atmosphere at about 9:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday, April 19,
                    though the forecast comes with an uncertainty of plus/minus
                    16 hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] RHESSI entered service in 2002 and, until its
                    retirement in 2018, it observed solar flares and coronal
                    mass ejections from its low-Earth orbit. Its work enabled
                    scientists to learn more about the underlying physics of how
                    these powerful bursts of energy occur.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spacecraft's activities included imaging the high-energy
                    electrons that carry a large part of the energy released in
                    solar flares. Using its imaging spectrometer, RHESSI became
                    the first-ever mission to record gamma-ray images and
                    high-energy X-ray images of solar flares.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The mission also helped to improve measurements of the
                    sun's shape, and demonstrated that terrestrial gamma ray
                    flashes — described by NASA as "bursts of gamma rays emitted
                    from high in Earth's atmosphere" and which occur above some
                    thunderstorms — happen more frequently than first thought.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA said it retired RHESSI in 2018 after maintaining
                    communications with it became difficult. After retaining its
                    low-Earth orbit for the last five years, the spacecraft is
                    about to meet a fiery end.

                    NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter was designed to fly just

                    "When we first flew, we thought we would be incredibly lucky
                    to eke out five flights," said Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity
                    team lead at JPL, in a blog post celebrating the 50th flight
                    . "We have exceeded our expected cumulative flight time
                    since our technology demonstration wrapped by 1,250 percent

                    The Ingenuity team is now planning a 51st flight to bring
                    the 'copter close to the "Fall River Pass" region of Jezero
                    Crater. Future flights will head towards "Mount Julian,"
                    from where the craft will enjoy panoramic views of the
                    nearby Belva Crater, an 800-metre dent in Mars' surface.

                    Between 2019 and 2020, data that Cybersixgill collected
                    reflected a massive surge in use of encrypted messaging
                    platforms, with the total number of collected items
                    increasing by 730%. In the firm's 2020-2021 analysis, this
                    number increased by 338%, and then just 23% in 2022 to some
                    1.9 billion items collected from messaging platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When considering workflow activity, it's quicker and easier
                    to browse through channels on the messaging platforms rather
                    than needing to log in to various forums, and read through
                    posts, etc.," said Liggett.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Across the dark web onion sites, the total number of forum
                    posts and replies decreased by 13% between 2021 and 2022,
                    dropping from over 91.7 million to around 79.1 million. The
                    number of threat actors actively participating in top forums
                    also declined slightly, according to the report.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 10 largest cybercrime forums averaged 165,390 monthly
                    users in 2021, which dropped by 4% to 158,813 in 2022.
                    However, posts on those 10 sites grew by nearly 28%, meaning
                    the forums' participants became more active.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study said that, in the past, most threat actors
                    conducted their operations on the dark web alone, while in
                    recent years there's been migration to deep-web encrypted
                    messaging platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cybercriminals favor deep web platforms because of their
                    relative ease of use versus Tor, which requires more
                    technical skills. "Across easily-accessible platforms, chats
                    and channels, threat actors collaborate and communicate,
                    trading tools, stolen data and services in an illicit
                    network that operates in parallel to its dark web
                    equivalent," said the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "People tend to communicate in real-time across these
                    platforms," said Liggett. "Forums and marketplaces in the
                    dark web are notorious for not always having a high level of
                    uptime. They sometimes end up going offline after a period
                    of time, or as we've seen recently have been seized by law
                    enforcement and government agencies," he said, noting that
                    one such platform, RaidForums, was taken down in 2022, and
                    BreachedForums just a couple weeks ago.

                    Speaking to <em>The Register</em>, MariaDB CMO Franz Aman
                    said the company was still hiring, but a number of job
                    losses had also been necessary. "It's absolutely no secret
                    that, like companies in tech, we need to be super prudent,
                    and we need to be fiscal responsive. We also had a look at
                    our headcount plan, and we had to make sure that we were
                    doing the right things. We had a reduction in workforce...
                    so have most other tech companies: everyone's concerned
                    about profitability, cash position."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Aman argued that a "going concern" notice in regulatory
                    filings was far from unusual.

                    Elon Musk's stated goal of putting humans on Mars relies
                    heavily on the development of a next-generation reusable
                    spacecraft, and Starship (formerly known as Big Falcon
                    Rocket or BFR) is ready for its first orbital test flight.
                    It's not the "six months" goal Musk projected in 2019, but
                    after a number of suborbital tests that included some

                    With just over five minutes to go before its first scheduled
                    launch attempt Monday morning, SpaceX announced that due to
                    a pressurization issue with the first stage, the attempt
                    became a "wet dress rehearsal," and the countdown ended with
                    10 seconds to go. SpaceX

                    (things are actually slightly more complicated than this -
                    your password is used to generate a key that is then used to
                    encrypt and decrypt the <em>actual</em> encryption key. This
                    is necessary in order to allow you to change your password
                    without having to re-encrypt the entire drive - instead you
                    simply re-encrypt the encryption key with the new
                    password-derived key. This also allows you to have multiple
                    passwords or unlock mechanisms per drive)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Good KDFs reduce this risk by being what's technically
                    referred to as "expensive". Rather than performing one
                    simple calculation to turn a password into a key, they
                    perform a <em>lot</em> of calculations. The number of
                    calculations performed is generally configurable, in order
                    to let you trade off between the amount of security (the
                    number of calculations you'll force an attacker to perform
                    when attempting to generate a key from a potential password)
                    and performance (the amount of time you're willing to wait
                    for your laptop to generate the key after you type in your
                    password so it can actually boot). But, obviously, this
                    tradeoff changes over time - defaults that made sense 10
                    years ago are not necessarily good defaults now. If you set
                    up your encrypted partition some time ago, the number of
                    calculations required may no longer be considered up to
                    scratch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And, well, some of these assumptions are kind of bad in the
                    first place! Just making things computationally expensive
                    doesn't help a lot if your adversary has the ability to test
                    a large number of passwords in parallel. GPUs are extremely
                    good at performing the sort of calculations that KDFs
                    generally use, so an attacker can "just" get a whole pile of
                    GPUs and throw them at the problem. KDFs that are
                    computationally expensive don't do a great deal to protect
                    against this. However, there's another axis of expense that
                    can be considered - memory. If the KDF algorithm requires a
                    significant amount of RAM, the degree to which it can be
                    performed in parallel on a GPU is massively reduced. A
                    Geforce 4090 may have 16,384 execution units, but if each
                    password attempt requires 1GB of RAM and the card only has
                    24GB on board, the attacker is restricted to running 24
                    attempts in parallel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, in these days of attackers with access to a pile of
                    GPUs, a purely computationally expensive KDF is just not a
                    good choice. And, unfortunately, the subject of this story
                    was almost certainly using one of those. Ubuntu 18.04 used
                    the LUKS1 header format, and the only KDF supported in this
                    format is
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a>.
                    This is not a memory expensive KDF, and so is vulnerable to
                    GPU-based attacks. But even so, systems using the LUKS2
                    header format used to default to
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2">argon2i</a>,
                    again not a memory expensive KDF. New versions default to
                    argon2id, which is. You want to be using argon2id.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What makes this worse is that distributions generally don't
                    update this in any way. If you installed your system and it
                    gave you pbkdf2 as your KDF, you're probably still using
                    pbkdf2 even if you've upgraded to a system that would use
                    argon2id on a fresh install. Thankfully, this can all be
                    fixed-up in place. But note that if anything goes wrong here
                    you could lose access to all your encrypted data, so before
                    doing anything make sure it's all backed up (and figure out
                    how to keep said backup secure so you don't just have your
                    data seized that way).

                    However, the language as it stands has prompted concerns
                    from the open source world. While the text does seem to
                    exempt non-commercial open source software from its scope,
                    trying to define what is meant by "non-commercial" is not a
                    straight forward endeavor. As GitHub policy director Mike

                    the time being. Starboard, the owner of pro-conservative

                    temporary but indefinite basis after completing its
                    acquisition of the social network from Parlement
                    Technologies. The buyer says it will conduct a "strategic
                    assessment" of the platform during the downtime, and hopes
                    to integrate Parler's audience into all its existing

                    Starboard isn't shy about its strategy. While it still sees
                    a market for communities that believe they've been censored
                    or marginalized, it considers a Parler revamp virtually
                    necessary. "No reasonable person believes that a Twitter
                    clone just for conservatives is a viable business any more,"
                    the company says.

                    in January, the Great Salt Lake will likely also disappear
                    within five years if residents continue their current rate
                    of "unsustainable" water consumption.

                    The good news is Utahans still have time to halt or even
                    reverse the Great Salt Lake's decline by using less water.
                    Cutting agricultural and other outdoor water use by a third
                    to half through a combination of voluntary conservation
                    measures and policy changes would allow the lake to refill
                    enough to support the region's economy, ecology and quality
                    of life, the report says. If Utahans succeed, the Great Salt
                    Lake can be a model for how to save other saline lakes
                    around the world.

                    The folks at Peto's Travel Center and Casino in Roanoke,
                    Louisiana see all kinds of vehicles pull up, but Tuesday
                    night was different. What ended up in their parking lot is
                    certainly something of a mystery, to say the least.

                    Someone left a Russian T-90A tank, which open source
                    intelligence (OSINT) trackers say was captured by Ukraine
                    last fall, on a trailer after the truck hauling it broke
                    down and pulled into this truck stop off U.S. Interstate 10.
                    An employee at Peto's, and the individual who first posted
                    the images on Reddit, shared them with The War Zone.

                    In March, <em>Tristan Harris</em>, Co-Founder of the Center
                    for Humane Technology, invited leaders to a lecture on how
                    AI could wipe out humanity. To begin his doomsday
                    presentation, he stated: "What nukes are to the physical
                    world ... AI is to everything else."

                    [...] To further escalate the AI panic,
                    <em>Tristan Harris</em>published an OpEd in
                    <em>The New York Times</em> with
                    <em>Yuval Noah Harari</em> and <em>Aza Raskin</em>. Among
                    their overdramatic claims: "We have summoned an alien
                    intelligence," "A.I. could rapidly eat the whole human
                    culture," and AI's "godlike powers" will "master us."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This is what happens when you bring together two of
                    the worst thinkers on new technologies," added
                    <em>Lee Vinsel</em>. "Among other shared tendencies,

                    on minimizing the potential damage by reducing the height of
                    the geysers, the volume of expelled water, or the resulting

                    NASA is clearly unable to install new hardware equipment on
                    Curiosity, but the latest software update makes image
                    processing faster so that the rover needs to stop "for just
                    a moment or two" instead of the full minute needed before.
                    This way, Curiosity will consume less energy and extend its
                    mission even further.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second major improvement brought by the R13 update is
                    for the rover's aluminum wheels, which started to show signs
                    of wear within the mission's first year. The patches
                    installed before provided the rover with an algorithm to
                    improve traction, now R13 "goes further" in that direction
                    by introducing "two new mobility commands" that can reduce
                    the amount of steering Curiosity needs to do "while driving
                    in an arc toward a specific waypoint," NASA said. The
                    driving process will be simpler, thus wear should be further
                    reduced.

                    There's some controversy in the photography world as an
                    AI-generated image won a major prize at a prestigious
                    competition,

                    by Boris Eldagsen took first prize in the Creative category
                    at the World Photography Organization's Sony World
                    Photography Awards — despite not being taken by a camera.
                    Eldagsen subsequently refused the award, saying "AI is not
                    photography. I applied [...] to find out if the competitions
                    are prepared for AI images to enter. They are not."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eldagsen's image is part of a series called
                    <em>PSEUDOMNESIA: Fake Memories</em>, designed to evoke a
                    photographic style of the 1940s. However, they are in
                    reality "fake memories of a past, that never existed, that
                    no one photographed. These images were imagined by language
                    and re-edited more between 20 to 40 times through AI image
                    generators, combining 'inpainting', 'outpainting', and
                    'prompt whispering' techniques."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a blog, Eldagsen explained that he used his experience as
                    a photographer to create the prize-winning image, acting as
                    a director of the process with the AI generators as
                    "co-creators." Although the work is inspired by photography,
                    he said that the point of the submission is that it is
                    <em>not</em> photography. "Participating in open calls, I
                    want to speed up the process of the Award organizers to
                    become aware of this difference and create separate
                    competitions for AI-generated images," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eldagsen subsequently declined the prize. "Thank you for
                    selecting my image and making this a historic moment, as it
                    is the first AI-generated image to win in a prestigious
                    international photography competition," he

                    >. "How many of you knew or suspected that it was AI
                    generated? Something about this doesn't feel right, does it?
                    AI images and photography should not compete with each other
                    in an award like this. They are different entities. AI is
                    not photography. Therefore I will not accept the award.

                When does the processing of a 'photograph' become unacceptable?
                Techniques such as burning and dodging, plus various types of
                film processing, can all change the image that is finally
                produced. Digital photographs can be even more easily modified.
                At what point does it become an entirely new genre. Does the
                method of production really matter? [JR]

                    In Switzerland, one in three employees suffers from
                    workplace stress. Those affected often don't realise that
                    their physical and mental resources are dwindling until it's
                    too late. This makes it all the more important to identify
                    work-related stress as early as possible where it arises: in
                    the workplace.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at ETH Zurich are now taking a crucial step in
                    this direction. Using new data and machine learning, they
                    have developed a model that can tell how stressed we are
                    just from the way we type and use our mouse.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And there's more: "How we type on our keyboard and move our
                    mouse seems to be a better predictor of how stressed we feel
                    in an office environment than our heart rate," explains
                    study author Mara Nägelin, a mathematician who conducts
                    research at the Chair of Technology Marketing and the
                    Mobiliar Lab for Analytics at ETH Zurich. Applied correctly,
                    these findings could be used in future to prevent increased
                    stress in the workplace early on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers are currently testing their model with
                    data from Swiss employees who have agreed to have their
                    mouse and keyboard behaviour as well as their heart data
                    recorded directly at their workplace using an app. The same
                    app also regularly asks the employees about their subjective
                    stress levels. Results should be available by the end of the
                    year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, workplace stress detection also raises some thorny
                    issues: "The only way people will accept and use our
                    technology is if we can guarantee that we will anonymise and
                    protect their data. We want to help workers to identify
                    stress early, not create a monitoring tool for companies,"
                    Kerr says. In another study involving employees and
                    ethicists, the researchers are investigating which features
                    an app needs to have to meet these requirements and ensure
                    responsible handling of sensitive data.

                    As the world wakes up to exactly what a Tesla's onboard
                    cameras can capture and beam back to their makers, a wider
                    fear has arisen: is your car spying on you?

                    Systems such as telematics black boxes that record a
                    vehicle's location and how it is driven are commonplace
                    today. Complaints about how that data is fed back to Big
                    Brother seem old-fashioned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From Tesla's Model Y to the humble Mini, around two million
                    of these data-gathering cars have been registered in the UK
                    over the past five years.

                The question is, when will it be impossible to buy a car that
                can't spy on you.

                    If Intel wants larger subsidies for its Magdeburg mega-fab,

                    "It's logical that if the scale of the investment is

                    The EELS initiative comes in the backdrop of discoveries
                    made by the Cassini probe, which explored Saturn, its rings,
                    and moons for nearly 13 years. The iconic mission ended in
                    September 2017 when the spacecraft crashed into Saturn's
                    atmosphere.

                    The remarkable discovery of plumes of water vapor ejected
                    into space by Saturn's tiny icy moon Enceladus prompted the
                    development of this EELS snake robot. This raised the
                    possibility of a habitable liquid ocean beneath the moon's
                    frozen crust and piqued the space community's interest in

                    Retroviruses have the nifty trick of slipping a copy of
                    their genetic instructions inside our own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, chaos dominates inside a cancerous cell when it is
                    growing uncontrollably and the once tight control of these
                    ancient viruses is lost.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These ancient genetic instructions are no longer able to
                    resurrect whole viruses but they can create fragments of
                    viruses that are enough for the immune system to spot a
                    viral threat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The immune system is tricked into believing that the tumour
                    cells are infected and it tries to eliminate the virus, so
                    it's sort of an alarm system," Prof George Kassiotis, head
                    of retroviral immunology at the biomedical research centre,
                    told me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The antibodies summon other parts of the immune system that
                    kill off the "infected" cells - the immune system is trying
                    to stop a virus but in this case is taking out cancerous
                    cells.

                    after the vote, the LIBE committee rapporteur Juan Fernando
                    López Aguilar said:

                        The new framework is certainly an improvement compared
                        to previous mechanisms. However, we are not there yet.
                        We are not convinced that this new framework
                        sufficiently protects personal data of our citizens, and
                        therefore we doubt it will survive the test of the CJEU.
                        The Commission must continue working to address the
                        concerns raised by the European Data Protection Board

                    The Starship Orbital Flight Test is the planned first
                    spaceflight of the SpaceX Starship launch vehicle. The
                    planned launch site is Boca Chica, Texas. SpaceX plans on
                    using Starship prototypes Ship 24 (second stage) and Booster
                    7 (first stage). The Starship second stage will enter a
                    transatmospheric Earth orbit with a negative Earth perigee,
                    allowing Ship 24 to reenter the atmosphere after completing
                    most of one orbit without having to restart its engines for
                    a deorbit maneuver. The earliest launch opportunity is
                    currently scheduled for April 17, 2023 at 08:00 CDT (13:00
                    UTC).

                    To improve security, the cybersecurity industry needs to
                    follow the aviation industry's shift from a blame culture to
                    a "just" culture, according to director of the Information
                    Systems Audit and Control Association Serge Christiaans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Speaking at Singapore's
                    <a
                      href="https://www.singaporetechnologyweek.com/smart-cybersecurity-summit-singapore-2023/smart-cybersecurity-summit-conference-programme"

                    >
                    this week, Christiaans explained that until around 1990, the
                    number of fatal commercial jet accidents was
                    <a
                      href="https://accidentstats.airbus.com/statistics/fatal-accidents"
                      >growing</a
                    >
                    alongside a steady increase of commercial flights. But
                    around the turn of the decade, the number of flights
                    continued to rise while the number of fatalities began to
                    drop.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While acknowledging that improved technology, more
                    mature processes and improved leadership all helped to
                    improve aviation safety, the former pilot and field CISO at
                    tech consultancy Sopra Steria said the biggest improvements
                    came from a change to a "just culture" that accepts people
                    will make mistakes and by doing so makes it more likely
                    errors will be reported.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a just culture, errors are viewed as learning
                    opportunities instead of moral failing, creating
                    transparency and enabling constant improvement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Christiaans said he is yet to come across a company
                    that had implemented open reporting without punishment in
                    cybersecurity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He attributed this to the industry working from the top
                    down. The people at the top worked hard to get to leadership
                    roles and become resistant to change. Shifting culture
                    therefore needs to start with new recruits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Furthermore, not all of the aviation industry has been
                    a beacon of transparent culture. For example, whistleblowers
                    have
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/business/boeing-737-max-crashes.html"
                      >alleged</a
                    >
                    that culture at Boeing emphasized profit over safety,
                    ultimately leading to engineering decisions that caused the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/15/boeing_737_max_senate_report/"
                      >crash</a
                    >
                    of two 737 MAX airplanes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But Christiaan's analysis may be true at least when it
                    comes to pilots and airlines, especially when culture is
                    changed with small steps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "So you plant the seeds, some airlines adapt, some don't,"
                    said Christiaans. "The ones who adapt, succeed."

                    [...] NovoNutrients relies on bacteria to do the dirty work.
                    The company has surveyed the scientific literature to find
                    species that can use carbon dioxide in their metabolic
                    pathways, allowing them to use the waste gas as energy. Its
                    scientists have also discovered strains not otherwise known
                    to science.

                    "Our technology is about how do you industrialize this
                    naturally occurring metabolism?" CEO David Tze told
                    TechCrunch+.

                  <p>
                    [...] The company's approach has several advantages over
                    other methods of using carbon dioxide. For one thing, it
                    does not require large amounts of land or water, which are
                    both in short supply in many parts of the world. It also
                    does not require the use of fossil fuels, which are a major
                    contributor to climate change.

                    NovoNutrients is not the only company working on using
                    carbon dioxide to create protein. Other companies, such as
                    Calysta and Deep Branch Biotechnology, are also developing
                    similar technologies. However, NovoNutrients believes that
                    its approach is unique because it uses bacteria to create
                    protein products that are high in quality and can be sold at
                    a competitive price.

                    The company's pilot-scale plant will be located in
                    California and is expected to be operational by the end of
                    2021 [sic]. If successful, NovoNutrients plans to build a
                    larger commercial-scale plant that could produce up to 1,000
                    metric tons of protein per year.

                  <p>
                    Despite criticism by UN members, she said, "by April 2022,
                    many democratic countries that had strongly opposed the
                    draft treaty were actively engaging in the negotiations and
                    pursuing compromise through amendments."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What concerns Rodriguez and other representatives of
                    advocacy groups at the briefing is that the treaty
                    negotiators will compromise on surveillance, privacy, and
                    human rights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Part of the problem lies in the vague language of the
                    proposed chapters. Rodriguez cited the chapters on
                    international cooperation, which could open the door to bulk
                    data sharing rather than investigations related to specific
                    evidence. Another problem, she said, is the dual criminality
                    provision which could bring state authorities into
                    investigating activities that they do not consider crimes in
                    their own country.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Unfortunately, instead of progressing towards a human
                    rights-based approach in the negotiation of the treaty, as
                    of now, the current draft is moving away from them," said
                    Rodriguez. "Countries such as India, Russia, China, Iran,
                    Syria, Egypt, and Tonga have even proposed to delete
                    references to international human rights obligations."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another problematic section, she said, endorses "special
                    investigative techniques." It would make any form of
                    surveillance acceptable, whether it exists currently, like
                    facial recognition, or has yet to be developed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This provision also has a very problematic clause, which
                    allows the removal or replacement of data being transmitted
                    over networks," said Rodriguez.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Barbora Bukovská, senior director for law and policy with
                    ARTICLE 19, a UK-based human rights organization, said many
                    of the proposed new crimes are speech-based offenses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Those are offenses when you're punished for speaking or
                    doing something online, because this peripherally involves
                    using computer or digital technology," said Bukovská. "And
                    there are extremely vague and overbroad provisions which the
                    states would have to then replicate their national
                    legislation."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One consequence of this, she said, would be to restrict
                    freedom of expression.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It should be a concern to journalists, human rights
                    defenders, and activists in general because you might be
                    prosecuted under these provisions if adopted in national
                    legislation," she said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "It must be ensured that government hacking must not
                    be justified in any way," said Fachathaler. "Government
                    hacking is unlike any other form of existing surveillance
                    techniques. It is far more intrusive. It permits remote and
                    secret access to personal devices and data stored on them.
                    It can conduct various forms of real time surveillance. It
                    can manipulate data on devices without leaving any trace."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fachathaler said the current proposals also lack any remedy
                    for privacy violations and any power to audit investigations
                    to ensure compliance with applicable law.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We're not against more modern law enforcement techniques
                    because we understand modern law enforcement in response to
                    new developments in this field of cybercrime is of course
                    important and necessary," she said. "But the present draft
                    goes far beyond that simple goal."

                    Intel introduced the 8086 microprocessor in 1978, and its
                    influence still remains through the popular x86
                    architecture. The 8086 was a fairly complex microprocessor
                    for its time, implementing instructions in microcode with
                    pipelining to improve performance. This blog post explains
                    the microcode operations for a particular instruction, "ADD
                    immediate". As the 8086 documentation will tell you, this
                    instruction takes four clock cycles to execute. But looking
                    internally shows seven clock cycles of activity. How does

                    [...] The alternative is microcode: instead of building the
                    control circuitry from complex logic gates, the control
                    logic is largely replaced with code. To execute a machine
                    instruction, the computer internally executes several
                    simpler micro-instructions, specified by the microcode. In
                    other words, microcode forms another layer between the
                    machine instructions and the hardware. The main advantage of
                    microcode is that it turns the processor's control logic
                    into a programming task instead of a difficult logic design
                    task.

                    "Hello, I just committed a crime and I want to confess," a
                    panicked sounding man said in a call to a police department
                    in February. "I've placed explosives inside a local school,'
                    the man continued.
                  </p>
                  <p>"You did what?!" the operator responded.</p>
                  <p>
                    "I've placed explosives inside a local school," the man said
                    again, before specifying Hempstead High School in Dubuque,
                    Iowa, and providing its address. In response to the threat,
                    the school went on lockdown, and police searched the school
                    but found nothing, according to a local media report.

                    The bombs weren't real. But, crucially, neither was the
                    man's voice. The panicked man's lines sound artificially
                    generated, according to recordings of the swatting calls
                    reviewed by Motherboard. It is unclear how exactly the
                    caller generated the voice, be that some form of artificial
                    intelligence tool or another speech synthesis program. The
                    result, though, is a voice that sounds very consistent
                    across multiple calls.

                    [...] Known as "Torswats" on the messaging app Telegram, the
                    swatter has been calling in bomb and mass shooting threats
                    against highschools and other locations across the country.
                    Torswat's connection to these wide ranging swatting
                    incidents has not been previously reported. The further
                    automation of swatting techniques threatens to make an
                    already dangerous harassment technique more prevalent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Torswats carries out these threatening calls as part
                    of a paid service they offer. For $75, Torswats says they
                    will close down a school. For $50, Torswats says customers
                    can buy "extreme swattings," in which authorities will
                    handcuff the victim and search the house. Torswats says they
                    offer discounts to returning customers, and can negotiate
                    prices for "famous people and targets such as Twitch
                    streamers." Torswats says on their Telegram channel that
                    they take payment in cryptocurrency.

                    PRIMO (principal-component interferometric modeling) was
                    used to study over 30,000 simulated images of black holes in
                    the process of accreting gas. It's the accretion of such
                    superheated material that gives imaged black holes their
                    eerie silhouettes. The patterns in the simulations were then
                    used to boost the resolution of the fuzzy image released in
                    2019.

                    True fans are not interested in the flood of AI-generated
                    material: they want authenticity from the writers they know
                    and whose works they love. True fans don't care if LLMs can
                    churn out pale imitations of their favourite creators for
                    almost zero cost. They are happy to support the future work
                    of traditional creators by paying a decent price for
                    material. They understand that LLMs may be able to produce
                    at an ever-cheaper cost, but that humans can't.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There's a place for publishers (and literary magazines) in
                    this world, helping writers connect with their readers, and
                    turning writing that fans support into publications offered
                    in a variety of formats, both digital and physical. But for
                    that to happen publishers must accept that they serve
                    creators. That's unlike today, where many writers are little
                    more than hired labourers churning out work for the larger
                    publishing houses to exploit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In today's new world of slick, practically cost-free LLMs,
                    even the pittance of royalties will no longer be on offer to
                    most creators. It's time for the latter to move on to where
                    they are deeply appreciated, fairly paid, and really belong:
                    among their true fans.

                    It's timing, however, that animates Spectre. Spectre v2 –
                    the variant implicated in this particular vulnerability –
                    relies on timing side-channels to measure the misprediction
                    rates of indirect branch prediction in order to infer the
                    contents of protected memory. That's far from optimal in a
                    cloud environment with shared hardware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The bug hunters who identified the issue found that
                    Linux userspace processes to defend against Spectre v2
                    didn't work on VMs of "at least one major cloud provider."

                  <p>
                    As the disclosure describes it, under basic IBRS (Indirect
                    Branch Restricted Speculation, the

                    that opted out of STIBP (Single Thread Indirect Branch
                    Predictors), a defense against the sharing of branch
                    prediction between logical processors on a core.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread
                    branch target injection," the bug report explains. "However,
                    with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to
                    userspace, due to performance reasons, which disabled the
                    implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to
                    cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP
                    protects."

                    The experts made clear that an "increase in the number of
                    reported contents does not necessarily lead to a
                    corresponding increase in investigations and prosecutions
                    leading to better protection of children. As long as the
                    capacity of law enforcement agencies is limited to its
                    current size, an increase in reports will make effective
                    prosecution of depictions of abuse more difficult."

                  <p>
                    In addition, the study finds: "It is undisputed that
                    children need to be protected from becoming victims of child
                    abuse and depictions of abuse online... but they also need
                    to be able to enjoy the protection of fundamental rights as
                    a basis for their development and transition into
                    adulthood." It warns: „With regards to adult users with no
                    malicious intentions, chilling effects are likely to occur."

                    The Kodi Foundation has disclosed a data breach after
                    hackers stole the organization's MyBB forum database
                    containing user data and private messages and attempted to
                    sell it online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kodi is a cross-platform open-source media player,
                    organizer, and streaming suite, that supports a vast array
                    of third-party add-ons enabling the users to access content
                    from various sources or customize their experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The now-shut down Kodi forum has roughly 401,000 members who
                    used it to discuss media streaming, exchange tips, offer
                    support, share new add-ons, and more in 3 million posts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to an announcement published by the platform on
                    Saturday, hackers stole the forum database by logging into
                    the Admin console using an inactive staff member's
                    credentials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once they gained access to the admin panel, they created and
                    downloaded
                    <a href="https://docs.mybb.com/1.8/administration/backups/"

                    multiple times in 2023.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "MyBB admin logs show the account of a trusted but currently
                    inactive member of the forum admin team was used to access
                    the web-based MyBB admin console twice: on 16 February and
                    again on 21 February," explains Kodi in a message to its
                    users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The account was used to create database backups which were
                    then downloaded and deleted. It also downloaded existing
                    nightly full-backups of the database."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Kodi team confirmed that the actual account owner did
                    not perform these actions on the admin console, indicating
                    that the staff member's credentials were likely stolen.

                    "If you have used the same username and password on any

                    The law requires social media companies that earn more than
                    $100 million in annual revenue to work with third-party
                    services to verify new account holders' personal
                    information. This is done using "any commercially reasonable
                    age verification method" or government-issued IDs such as
                    photo IDs or driver's licenses. Current account holders
                    won't be affected.

                    The law states that social media companies are defined as
                    any online forum that lets users create public profiles and
                    interact with each other through digital content.

                    that in the final days of negotiations over the bill,
                    Arkansas lawmakers approved an amendment that appears to
                    exempt some of the world's biggest social media companies.
                    Given all the concern over TikTok's influence and its links
                    with China, it's surprising to see that social media
                    platforms that permit users to "generate short video clips
                    of dancing, voice overs, or other acts of entertainment in
                    which the primary purpose is not educational or informative"
                    are exempt. That would also seem to cover Facebook,
                    Instagram, Snapchat, as well as TikTok - but apparently not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Other exemptions include social media companies that
                    "exclusively" offer subscription content, and those focused
                    on "professional networking" and "career development" (i.e.,
                    LinkedIn). Companies that "exclusively offer" video
                    gaming-focused social networking features aren't covered,
                    either, which could include Twitch despite it not really
                    being a social media platform.

                    Transitioning from the traditional five-day, 40-hour work
                    week to a four-day week has the potential to reduce burnout
                    and boost performance among workers without negatively
                    affecting employer productivity, according to Cutler. "They
                    could also bring a competitive edge for employers who are
                    able to attract and retain talent," he said.

                    Gartner is seeing "a high amount of interest" in four-day
                    workweeks from its clients, according to Emily Rose McRae, a
                    senior director with the research firm's HR practice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Many organizations, and their HR leaders, see a four-day
                    workweek as the next step in their flexibility offerings for
                    employees — offering flexibility on when and how much people
                    work, in addition to where," she said. "For organizations
                    that haven't been able to successfully implement remote or
                    hybrid work, or that fundamentally can't for at least part
                    of their workforce, a four-day workweek offers an
                    opportunity to remain competitive in a still very tight
                    talent market by offering a different kind of flexibility."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In general, four-day work week pilots have shown that
                    productivity increases with reduced hours, so reducing pay
                    may not be necessary — but it is an option for organizations
                    that have regulatory or legal limits on reducing hours
                    without reducing pay, McRae said.

                      of the trial.

                      37% of employees saw improvements in physical health.

                    While both men and women benefit from the UK's four-day
                    week, women's experience is generally better, the study
                    said.

                    mental health, and reduced commuting time," Dale Whelehan,
                    Ph.D., a behavioral scientist and CEO of 4 Day Week Global,
                    said in an earlier interview. "Encouragingly, the burden of
                    non-work duties appears to be balancing out, with more men
                    taking on a greater share of housework and childcare."

                    [...] "Through our research and our models, we contrast
                    three varieties of retailers, relevant when consumers are
                    initially uncertain as to which is the best fit," says
                    Bar-Isaac. "The first is a retailer that offers more choice
                    through a deeper selection. The second is the retailer that
                    offers less choice, or a more shallow selection.
                    Alternatively, an online channel may provide little
                    opportunity to assess fit, even if there is a deep
                    selection."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers found that the first type of retailers,
                    those with deeper selections, tend to hold to higher prices
                    because they know that once a consumer enters the store,
                    they will likely find the best fit and make a purchase.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This means that the one consumer most likely to actually
                    influence price is the not-so-choosy consumer who starts off
                    by visiting a shallow store and expect that they will make a
                    purchase once they get there, as long as they can find a

                    "This group of consumers is the only one in the economy that
                    compares prices," adds Bar-Isaac. "The size of this group is
                    large enough that it plays a key role in price
                    determination."

                    more than one store to look for the perfect match and a
                    lower price," says Bar-Isaac. "This helps ensure that stores
                    we have dubbed 'shallow' are more likely to sell a higher
                    volume of a given product at a more competitive price, while
                    stores we've dubbed 'deep' are more likely to sell their
                    products at a higher price, oftentimes to more selective

                    Elon Musk gave a rare interview to an actual reporter late
                    on Tuesday, speaking to BBC reporter James Clayton on
                    Twitter Spaces. During the
                    <a
                      href="https://twitter.com/TexasLindsay_/status/1646006232484913153"
                      >interview</a
                    >, Clayton pressed Musk on whether his purchase of Twitter
                    was, in the end, something he went through with willingly,
                    or whether it was something he did because the active court
                    case at the time in which Twitter was trying to force him to
                    go through with the sale was going badly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The answer (which we all suspected anyway) was that Musk did
                    indeed only do the deal because he believed legally, he was
                    going to be forced to do so anyway. Here's the relevant
                    transcript from the Twitter Spaces audio:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        Clayton: So then you change your mind again, and decided
                        to buy it – did you do that? Did you do that?
                      </p>
                      <p>Musk: Well, I kind of had to.</p>
                      <p>
                        Clayton: Right. Did you do that, because you thought
                        that a court would make you do that?
                      </p>
                      <p>Musk: Yes.</p>
                      <p>Clayton: Right.</p>
                      <p>Musk: Yes, that is the reason.</p>
                      <p>
                        Clayton: So you were still trying to get out of it. And
                        then you just were advised by lawyers, "Look, you're
                        going to buy this?"
                      </p>
                      <p>Musk: Yes.</p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    In case you don't recall (it was all the way back in
                    September/October last year which is basically an eternity
                    ago in current Twitter time), Twitter took Musk to trial to
                    force him to honor his signed obligation to acquire the
                    company for the agreed-upon price of $44 billion, or $54.20
                    per share. Musk was contending that his obligation was void
                    because Twitter had, he claimed, inflated its real user
                    numbers and understated the number of bots on the platform.
                  </p>

                      company</a
                    >, a move most agreed at the time was made because his legal
                    case was weak and the trial was clearly not going his way.

                    approach that
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.00440"
                      >debuted in 2017</a
                    >. It uses machine learning algorithms running on a neural
                    network in place of conventional methods devised by humans.
                    These GANs generate password guesses after autonomously
                    learning the distribution of passwords by processing the
                    spoils of previous real-world breaches. These guesses are
                    used in offline attacks made possible when a database of
                    password hashes leaks as a result of a security breach.

                  <p>
                    Conventional password guessing uses lists of words numbering
                    in the billions taken from previous breaches. Popular
                    password-cracking applications like
                    <a href="https://www.hashcat.net/">Hashcat</a> and

                    [...] It's true that with the sources that are currently
                    available, human interpretation is needed to provide
                    context, says Kaplan, though he thinks this could change
                    once a sufficient number of historical documents are made
                    machine readable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But he imagines an application of machine learning that's
                    more transformational—and potentially more problematic.
                    Generative AI could be used to make predictions that flesh
                    out blank spots in the historical record—for instance, about
                    the number of apprentices in a Venetian artisan's
                    workshop—based not on individual records, which could be
                    inaccurate or incomplete, but on aggregated data. This may
                    bring more non-elite perspectives into the picture but runs
                    counter to standard historical practice, in which
                    conclusions are based on available evidence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, a more immediate concern is posed by neural networks
                    that create false records.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In other words, there's a risk that artificial
                    intelligence, from historical chatbots to models that make
                    predictions based on historical records, will get things
                    very wrong. Some of these mistakes are benign anachronisms:
                    a query to Aristotle on the chatbot Character.ai about his
                    views on women (whom he saw as inferior) returned an answer
                    that they should "have no social media." But others could be
                    more consequential—especially when they're mixed into a
                    collection of documents too large for a historian to be
                    checking individually, or if they're circulated by someone
                    with an interest in a particular interpretation of history.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even if there's no deliberate deception, some scholars have
                    concerns that historians may use tools they're not trained
                    to understand. "I think there's great risk in it, because we
                    as humanists or historians are effectively outsourcing
                    analysis to another field, or perhaps a machine," says
                    Abraham Gibson, a history professor at the University of
                    Texas at San Antonio. Gibson says until very recently,
                    fellow historians he spoke to didn't see the relevance of
                    artificial intelligence to their work, but they're
                    increasingly waking up to the possibility that they could
                    eventually yield some of the interpretation of history to a
                    black box.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While skepticism toward such new technology persists,
                    the field is gradually embracing it, and Valleriani thinks
                    that in time, the number of historians who reject
                    computational methods will dwindle. Scholars' concerns about
                    the ethics of AI are less a reason not to use machine
                    learning, he says, than an opportunity for the humanities to
                    contribute to its development.

                    killed at least four of the animals.

                  <p>
                    "We wanted to get the word out. We're seeing something we
                    haven't seen before, we want people to know about it and we
                    want people working on marine mammals to be aware of these
                    weird findings," said Miller, a wildlife veterinarian
                    specialist with the California Department of Fish and
                    Wildlife (DFW). "Take extra precautions."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In March, a study from the DFW and the University of
                    California, Davis, revealed that a rare strain of the
                    parasite, never before reported in aquatic animals, was tied
                    to the deaths of four sea otters. The strain, first seen in
                    Canadian mountain lions in 1995, had not been previously
                    detected on the California coast."This was a complete
                    surprise," Karen Shapiro, with the UC Davis School of
                    Veterinary Medicine, said in a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/health/news/sea-otters-killed-unusual-parasite-strain"
                      >statement</a
                    >. "The COUG [toxoplasma strain] genotype has never before
                    been described in sea otters, nor anywhere in the California
                    coastal environment or in any other aquatic mammal or bird."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Toxoplasma is often found in cat feces. Otters, which
                    live along the shoreline, can be exposed to the parasite in
                    rainwater runoff—all four cases scientists studied came in
                    during the heavy rainfall season.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Toxoplasmosis infection is common in sea otters—which have a
                    roughly 60 percent chance of being infected in their
                    lifetimes, Miller said—and can be fatal, but this strain is
                    of particular concern.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, Miller warned against unfairly demonizing cats.

                  <p>
                    "I don't want this to be a war on cats," she said. "I have
                    two cats. What I try to do is practice what I preach and
                    what I know as a scientist: I keep my cats indoors all the
                    time and I make sure to dispose of their litter into
                    something that will not leak into the environment."

                Many people believe that any and all opposition to the Covid
                vaccine comes from "far-right" Republican conspiracy theorists
                in the flyover states. I guess the Swiss government will now be
                branded with those labels as their Federal Office of Public
                Health is now recommending that a Covid vaccination is
                <b>not needed</b>, even for people at especially high risk. They
                list pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems
                as an exception. They further state that those who wish to
                receive a Covid vaccine must pay for it out of their own
                pockets.

                    In principle, no COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for
                    spring/summer 2023. Nearly everyone in Switzerland has been
                    vaccinated and/or contracted and recovered from COVID-19.
                    Their immune system has therefore been exposed to the
                    coronavirus. In spring/summer 2023, the virus will likely
                    circulate less. The current virus variants also cause rather
                    mild illness. For autumn 2023, the vaccination
                    recommendation will be evaluated again and adjusted
                    accordingly.

                    Gaming hardware manufacturer MSI confirmed today that it was
                    the victim of a cyberattack. In a
                    <a

                      >brief statement on its website</a
                    >, the company said that the attack hit "part of its
                    information systems," which have since returned to regular
                    operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company advises its customers only to get BIOS and
                    firmware updates from the MSI website and no other sources.
                    It's light on details, saying that after "detecting network
                    anomalies," MSI implemented "defense mechanisms and carried
                    out recovery measures," and then informed the the government
                    and law enforcement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The post doesn't mention if customer data was stolen
                    or affected. Tom's Hardware reached out to MSI but did not
                    hear back in time for publication. In addition, emails to
                    official spokesperson addresses listed on the company's
                    website bounced.
