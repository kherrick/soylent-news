                    To Shelby Mustang fans, the Original Venice Crew (OVC) is
                    the stuff of legends. This was the actual team that designed
                    and built the original GT350s, Cobras, Daytona Coupes, and
                    GT40s that introduced Carroll Shelby's name to the masses.
                    Today, OVC builds modern Mustang recreations so accurate
                    that one was approved for last year's Le Mans Classic, which
                    celebrated 100 years of the world's most famous endurance
                    race.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But OVC also offers updated versions of those classics,
                    bringing to life ideas that bounced around the shop back in
                    the day but that Shelby never built in series production.
                    Want a 1965 GT350 with independent rear suspension? OVC can
                    do that, after dialing in a design that Ford originally
                    believed would be too expensive as a replacement for the
                    first-gen Mustang's solid rear axle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These projects don't quite fit under the "restomod"
                    umbrella, instead falling more along the lines of the ideas
                    that OVC founder and boss Jim Marietta remembers from his
                    days back at
                    <a

                    machined or updated fiberglass front fascias to provide
                    additional airflow.<br />[...]<br />In the 1960s,
                    aerodynamicists struggled with a big gap between common
                    sense design and today's highly refined computational fluid
                    dynamics modeling. LaViolette arrived at Willow Springs
                    fresh off working on the aero packages for some of Shelby
                    American's forthcoming 2024 and '25 Mustangs and told me he
                    looked forward to seeing how the classic methods worked in
                    comparison.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Back in the day, it was one of those things where everybody
                    looked at it and went, 'Why would you do that? The air comes
                    in from the front!'" he laughed before climbing into the
                    driver's seat. "So what we're here today to do is put wool
                    tufts on the car and we're gonna do it old-school and we're
                    gonna see which way the wool flows, see if it starts sucking
                    into the scoop at the back."<br />[...]<br />"It works
                    perfect," he says. "Works just like everybody thought it
                    would... A lot of this is fly by the pants. 'Well, let's try
                    this, try that. OK, how does it seal? You have to move this
                    a little bit, shift it around, do a little bit of different
                    seal rubber.'"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's what you call American engineering," he chuckles.
                    "What nobody seems to do anymore these days."

                    provides new insight into what may have been motivating the

                    that Unity received some significant pushback from
                    senior-level managers before rolling out its initial
                    fee-restructuring plans. "Half of the people in that meeting
                    said that this model is too complicated, it's not going to
                    be well-received, and we should talk to people before we do
                    this," one anonymous source told the site. "It felt very
                    rushed. We had this meeting and were told it was happening,
                    but we were not told a date. And then before we knew it, it
                    was out there."

                  <p>
                    After the negative reaction to that initial plan, Unity
                    reportedly considered a modification that would take up to 4
                    percent of revenue from the largest Unity
                    publishers—slightly under

                    only after the extent of the backlash became clear.<br />[...]<br />Despite
                    bringing in over $1.8 billion in revenue in the 12 months
                    ending in June 2023, Unity was

                    tumultuous stock price, which grew from a 2020 IPO price of
                    $68 a share to a peak of nearly $200 a share in late 2021,

                    An international team of interdisciplinary researchers has
                    successfully created a method for better 3D modeling of
                    complex cancers. The University of Waterloo-based team
                    combined cutting-edge bioprinting techniques with synthetic
                    structures or microfluidic chips. The method will help lab
                    researchers more accurately understand heterogeneous tumors:
                    tumors with more than one kind of cancer cell, often
                    dispersed in unpredictable patterns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Traditionally, medical practitioners would biopsy a
                    patient's tumor, extract cells, and then grow them in flat
                    petri dishes in a lab. "For 50 years, this was how
                    biologists understood tumors," said Nafiseh Moghimi, an
                    applied mathematics post-doctoral researcher and the lead
                    author of the study. "But a decade ago, repeated treatment
                    failures in human trials made scientists realize that a 2D
                    model does not capture the real tumor structure inside the
                    body."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team's research addresses this problem by creating a 3D
                    model that not only reflects the complexity of a tumor but
                    also simulates its surrounding environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] First, the team created polymer "microfluidic chips":
                    tiny structures etched with channels that mimic blood flow
                    and other fluids surrounding a patient's tumor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, the team grew multiple types of cancer cells and
                    suspended these cell cultures in their own customized
                    bioink: a cocktail of gelatin, alginate, and other nutrients
                    designed to keep the cells cultures alive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, they used an extrusion bioprinter—a device that
                    resembles a 3D printer but for organic material—to layer the
                    different types of cancer cells onto the prepared
                    microfluidic chips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The result is a living, three-dimensional model of complex
                    cancers that scientists can then use to test different modes
                    of treatment, such as various chemotherapy drugs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The 3D-printed tumor models exemplify how new
                    technology enables faster, less expensive and less painful
                    treatments for serious conditions like late-stage breast
                    cancer.

                    New research from Asana shows that although UK workers are
                    open to the opportunities that AI can bring to the
                    workplace, a disconnect exists between organizational plans
                    for the technology and the current employee experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The data is derived from a survey of 2,741 UK workers,
                    carried out by
                    <a href="https://asana.com/work-innovation-lab"
                      >Asana’s Work Innovation Lab</a
                    >, a think tank that carries out research to help businesses
                    meet the demands of the evolving workplace.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the findings, AI’s role in helping companies
                    meet objectives is recognized by workers, with 49% of
                    surveyed employees confident that AI will help their
                    companies reach their objectives more effectively than
                    traditional methods of working.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With 40% of workers stating their organizations are
                    currently experiencing high levels of burnout, 92% of those
                    surveyed said they want AI to be used to enhance parts of
                    their job. Notably, 61% of respondents approve of AI being
                    used for development and training. Employees also
                    highlighted AI usage for customer service interactions,
                    decision making processes, and hiring processes, which had
                    approval rates of 50%, 32%, and 26%, respectively.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, there is a clear disconnect between what employees
                    would like to see AI used for in the workplace and how it is
                    currently being deployed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Instead of asking ourselves how AI will change our
                    work, we should be asking ourselves how we as humans can
                    positively shape that change, said Rebecca Hinds, head of
                    the Work Innovation Lab, at a roundtable event last week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “AI holds enormous power because of its complexity and
                    sophistication, but in order to harness the promise and the
                    potential of AI in our workplace we need to adopt a deeply
                    human approach,” Hinds said. “Decades of research show that
                    the implementation of new technology fails in most cases not
                    because the technology isn’t efficient, but because humans
                    naturally resist change.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When it comes to making a success of AI in the workplace,
                    Hinds said the organizations need to prioritize change
                    management, upskilling and reskilling, and experimentation
                    and allow their workers to commit time to familiarize
                    themselves with these news tools.

                    In 2014, NASA narrowed the crew competition to just two
                    companies, Boeing and SpaceX. At that time, the space agency
                    awarded Boeing $4.2 billion in funding for development of
                    the Starliner spacecraft and six operational crew flights.
                    Later, in an award that NASA's own inspector general
                    described as "unnecessary," NASA paid Boeing an additional
                    $287.2 million. This brings Boeing's total to $4.49 billion

                    to passengers in San Francisco, the California Department of
                    Motor Vehicles (DMV) has shut down Cruise's driverless
                    operations in the state.

                  <p>
                    Yesterday, the California DMV suspended Cruise's permits for
                    autonomous vehicle deployment and driverless testing
                    "effective immediately" over pedestrian safety concerns.<br />[...]<br />The
                    suspension followed two notable accidents involving Cruise's
                    robotaxis. In August, one person was injured after a Cruise
                    vehicle crashed into a fire truck,
                    <a

                      >CNBC reported</a
                    >. And earlier this month, a pedestrian using a crosswalk
                    was found in critical condition after a driver of another
                    vehicle struck the pedestrian and threw her into the path of
                    an oncoming Cruise robotaxi.

                  <p>
                    This hit-and-run incident is still being investigated.

                    >, its autonomous vehicle (AV) detected the collision and
                    stopped on top of the pedestrian, then veered off the road,
                    dragging the pedestrian about 20 feet. When the AV finally
                    stopped, it appeared to pin the pedestrian's leg beneath a
                    tire while videos showed the pedestrian was screaming for
                    help.

                    A few weeks after the October incident, the National Highway
                    Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into
                    Cruise, examining whether Cruise had taken enough
                    precautions to keep pedestrians safe,

                    "Examples of such willful ignorance abound in everyday life,
                    such as when consumers ignore information about the
                    problematic origins of the products they buy," said lead
                    author Linh Vu, MS, a doctoral candidate at the University
                    of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We wanted to know just how prevalent and how harmful
                    willful ignorance is, as well as why people engage in it."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Across the studies, the researchers found that when
                    given an option, 40% of people chose not to learn the
                    consequences of their actions. That willful ignorance was
                    correlated with less altruism: People were 15.6 percentage
                    points more likely to be generous to someone else when they
                    were told the consequences of their choice compared with
                    when they were allowed to remain ignorant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers hypothesized that one reason for willful
                    ignorance might be that some people behave altruistically
                    because they want to maintain a positive self-image of being
                    an altruistic person. In those cases, willful ignorance can
                    allow them to maintain that self-image without having to act
                    in an altruistic way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "While most people are willing to do the right thing
                    when they are fully informed of the consequences of their
                    actions, this willingness is not always because people care
                    for others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "A part of the reasons why people act altruistically is due
                    to societal pressures as well as their desire to view
                    themselves in a good light. Since being righteous is often
                    costly, demanding people to give up their time, money and
                    effort, ignorance offers an easy way out."

                    [...] In addition to promising to honor California's right
                    to repair provisions across the nation, Naumann also talked
                    about what an ideal federal law should have. "We believe
                    that a uniform federal repair law should do the following:
                    Maintain privacy, data and device security features which
                    help to thwart theft; Ensure transparency for consumers
                    about the type of parts used in a repair; Apply
                    prospectively, to allow manufacturers to focus on building
                    new products that can comply with the proposals; And
                    finally, create a strong national standard that benefits
                    consumers across the US and reduces the confusion created by
                    potentially conflicting state approaches," he said.

                    In other words, at least 7.4 million Americans over 65 have
                    no idea they’re living with mild cognitive impairment, with
                    the authors further estimating that as many as 10 million
                    Americans are undiagnosed if you include those over age 50.

                    Many, if not most, people will experience some degree of
                    cognitive decline as they age, and not every case will lead
                    to significant issues. But oftentimes, mild cognitive
                    impairment is the first stage of a more serious
                    neurodegenerative disorder, particularly Alzheimer’s
                    disease, the most common form of dementia. About 10% to 15%
                    of these cases in people over 65 will progress to full-blown
                    dementia annually, according to the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia/related_conditions/mild-cognitive-impairment"
                      >Alzheimer’s Association</a
                    >, while one-third of people with mild cognitive impairment
                    due to Alzheimer’s will develop dementia within five years.

                    “With MCI, there are actually a chunk of cases that have
                    their easy fixes—some might be caused by medication side
                    effects or vitamin deficiencies, and all kinds of things we
                    can address if cases are detected,” Mattke said. “And we are
                    starting to see disease-modifying treatments that might be
                    able to change the trajectory of degenerative conditions
                    like Alzheimer’s.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There are readily available tests for cognitive
                    decline, Mattke notes, though they take time (10 or more
                    minutes) to conduct. Many doctors might not feel compelled
                    to screen for it in their older patients, or may be too
                    busy, and patients might not think to ask for such screening
                    until they’re much further along in their impairment. So
                    Mattke hopes his team’s research can start to make both
                    groups more aware and willing to get ahead of this growing
                    health issue.

                    As it turns out, there’s also a not-so-good problem. So far,
                    the curation team has managed to remove some of the material
                    from inside the canister with tweezers or a scoop while
                    holding down the TAGSAM head’s mylar flap. Over the next few
                    weeks, the team will try to come up with new ways to extract
                    the rest of the sample.

                    “The tools for any proposed solution to extract the

                    have proven to be quite promising so hopefully the remaining
                    bits of the space rock make it out of that canister soon.

                    The lawsuit claims Meta has designed and deployed “harmful
                    features” on Instagram and Facebook, which get younger
                    people addicted to these platforms. The coalition of
                    attorneys general are seeking “injunctive and monetary
                    relief” to address the alleged misconduct.

                  <p>
                    New York attorney general Letitia James said nine additional
                    attorneys general are filing lawsuits in their respective
                    state courts, which means 42 attorneys general are taking
                    action against Meta.

                  <p>
                    [...] California attorney general Rob Bonta said the
                    complaints are the result of a nationwide investigation that
                    he announced in 2021. He claims this bipartisan
                    investigation found that Meta has been “cultivating
                    addiction to boost corporate profits”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The lawsuit also claims that Meta refused to address
                    issues relating to the negative effects its sites were
                    causing, despite overwhelming evidence.

                    [...] What's causing collapse? "It's an objective
                    phenomenon," insists Penrose. He's convinced this objective
                    phenomenon has to be the fundamental force: gravity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For Penrose, the relationship between gravity and
                    consciousness was inspired by a revolutionary mathematical
                    discovery nearly a century ago. In 1931, mathematician Kurt
                    Gödel revealed his incompleteness theorems—theorems of
                    mathematical logic that show there are statements in
                    mathematics that must be true even though they can't be
                    proven. Gödel's incompleteness theorems, and Goodstein's
                    theorem sometime later, made an indelible imprint on
                    Penrose. He took from these theorems that there's a unique
                    property of the physical universe giving rise to conscious
                    understanding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The ability to understand Gödel and Goodstein's
                    theorems means there's something about our conscious
                    understanding that is not confined to computational
                    boundaries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When it comes to the suddenly salient question of
                    whether or not AI could be conscious, Penrose draws again
                    from Gödel and Goodstein's theorems. Computer science is
                    built on formalized systems. They're confined by
                    computation. For Penrose, AI built on classical computers
                    today isn't capable of true understanding or consciousness.
                    After some consideration, he adds a caveat when it comes to
                    quantum computers: "You put wave function collapse into its
                    process somehow..."

                    When we're confronting a vexing problem, we often gather a
                    group to brain­storm. We're looking to get the best ideas as
                    quickly as possible. I love seeing it happen—except for one
                    tiny wrinkle. Group brainstorming usually backfires.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In brainstorming meetings, many good ideas are lost— and few
                    are gained. Extensive
                    <a

                    shows that when we generate ideas together, we fail to
                    maximize collective intelligence. Brainstorming groups fall
                    so far short of their potential that we get more ideas—and
                    better ideas—if we all work alone. As the humorist Dave
                    Barry quipped, "If you had to identify, in one word, the
                    reason why the human race has not achieved, and never will
                    achieve, its full potential, that word would be: 'meetings.'
                    " But the problem isn't meetings themselves—it's how we run
                    them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Collective intelligence begins with individual
                    creativity. But it doesn't end there. Individuals produce a
                    greater volume and variety of novel ideas when they work
                    alone. That means that they come up with more brilliant
                    ideas than groups—but also more terrible ideas than groups.
                    It takes collective judgment to find the signal in the noise
                    and bring the best ideas to fruition.

                    [...] 'The new sound decomposition method opens many
                    exciting possibilities in sound processing,' says professor
                    Välimäki. 'The slowing down of sound is currently our main
                    interest. It is striking that for example in sports news,
                    the slow-motion videos are always silent. The reason is
                    probably that the sound quality in current slow-down audio
                    tools is not good enough. We have already started developing
                    better time-scale modification methods, which use a deep
                    neural network to help stretch some components.'
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The high-quality sound decomposition also enables novel
                    types of music remixing techniques. One of them leads to
                    distortion-free dynamic range compression. Namely, the
                    transient component often contains the loudest peaks in the
                    sound waveform, so simply reducing the level of the
                    transient component and mixing it back with the others can
                    limit the peak-to-peak value of audio.

                    Striking design, bold font, and the punchy name Release. But
                    inside, each bottle was filled with urine allegedly
                    discarded by Amazon delivery drivers and collected from
                    plastic bottles by the side of the road.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That didn't stop Amazon from listing it for sale, though.
                    Release even attained No. 1 bestseller status in the "Bitter
                    Lemon" category. It was created by Oobah Butler for a new
                    documentary, The Great Amazon Heist, which airs on Channel 4
                    in the UK today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Butler is a journalist, presenter, and renowned puller of
                    stunts—he's probably most famous for turning his shed in a
                    London garden into the

                      >number one ranked restaurant on Tripadvisor</a
                    >.<br />[...]<br />Drummond [Amazon spokesperson] says this
                    was a "crude stunt" and that the company has
                    "industry-leading tools to prevent genuinely unsafe products
                    being listed."<br />[...]<br />The Great Amazon Heist
                    doesn't tell us anything particularly new. (Drummond says
                    the documentary is a "heavily distorted picture of our
                    processes and operations that do not reflect the realities
                    of shopping with or working for Amazon.") But placing all of
                    these elements alongside each other in an hour of television
                    paints a stark picture. Drivers and warehouse workers put up

                    The Great Amazon Heist portrays a company that simply
                    doesn't seem to care.

                    At first glance, the spotted lanternfly looks like an
                    elegant butterfly, speckled with black spots on white wings
                    with a splash of bright red.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the insect native to parts of Asia (<em
                      >Lycorma delicatula</em
                    >) is attacking plants and trees in the United States, and
                    officials are moving quickly to try to contain its spread.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The only good spotted lanternfly is a dead one," said Amy
                    Korman, an entomologist at Penn State Extension, a part of
                    the university that provides training and education in
                    everything from farming to food safety to landscaping.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The insect was first detected in the United States in 2014,
                    in Berks County, Pennsylvania. An egg mass was found in a
                    shipment of stone from China, according to experts who have
                    tracked its progress.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The SLF—as experts call it—poses no threat to humans or
                    animals, but it has caused hundreds of millions of dollars
                    in damage in the US agricultural sector, even though it has
                    only been found in 14 states.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Spotted lanternflies have a particular affinity for
                    grape vines. Scientists have observed dozens, even hundreds
                    of them on a single vine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Several US states have tasked scientists with finding
                    a way to eradicate the SLF—a true race against the clock, as
                    entomologists predict the pest will reach the US West
                    Coast—and its storied vineyards—by 2027-2030.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] On the grassroots level, residents have organized
                    makeshift patrols to kill the bugs—because they don't fly
                    far, they are relatively easy to smash, but their relatively
                    large size makes the task rather unappetizing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Westchester County, in the northern suburbs of New York
                    City, sniffer dogs are being deployed to find SLF egg
                    masses—and giant vacuums are being used to suck up older
                    specimens.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some have gone so far as to poison the sap of the tree of
                    heaven, one of the insect's favorite trees that also comes
                    from Asia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the spotted lanternfly does not have a natural predator
                    in North America.

                    Amazon on Thursday released photos of its newest delivery
                    drone, the MK 30, and announced will expand its Prime Air
                    drone delivery operations to Italy, the UK, and an unnamed
                    American city in 2024.

                    “The new locations add to our existing drone delivery
                    operations in the U.S., where we’ve been using drones to
                    safely deliver packages weighing up to five pounds in one

                    The MK30 doesn't improve that payload capacity, or volume.
                    But Amazon touts the design as “quieter, smaller and
                    lighter” than the previous model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The MK30 also doubles the range of previous Prime Air drone
                    models, with roughly half the noise, and in more diverse
                    weather conditions. The previous version did not allow
                    delivery in light rain, wind, hot temperatures or other
                    adverse conditions.

                    The new drone is equipped with sense and avoid technology to
                    dodge obstacles. Its design takes on a tiltrotor concept,
                    acting as a helicopter upon takeoff and transitioning into
                    horizontal wing-borne flight once in the air.

                    Thousands of satellites are currently orbiting the Earth,
                    and there will be many more in the future. Researchers from
                    Ruhr University Bochum and the CISPA Helmholtz Center for
                    Information Security in Saarbrücken have assessed the
                    security of these systems from an IT perspective. They
                    analysed three current low-earth orbit satellites and found
                    that, from a technical point of view, hardly any modern
                    security concepts were implemented. Various security
                    mechanisms that are standard in modern mobile phones and
                    laptops were not to be found: for example, there was no
                    separation of code and data. Interviews with satellite
                    developers also revealed that the industry relies primarily
                    on security through obscurity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Satellites orbiting the Earth can only be reached by
                    their ground station on Earth within a time window of a few
                    minutes. The systems must be robust against the radiation in
                    space, and, since they can only consume a small amount of
                    energy, they have a low power output. "The data rates are
                    like those of modems in the 1990s," as Holz elaborates the
                    challenges satellite developers face.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Based on the findings gained from the software analysis, the
                    researchers worked out various attack scenarios. They showed
                    that they could cut off the satellites from ground control
                    and seize control of the systems, for example in order to
                    take pictures with the satellite camera. "We were surprised
                    that the technical security level is so low," points out
                    Thorsten Holz, adding the following caveat with regard to
                    potential ramifications: "It wouldn't be all that easy to
                    steer the satellite to another location, for example, to
                    crash it or have it collide with other objects."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To find out how the people who develop and build satellites
                    approach security, the research team compiled a
                    questionnaire and submitted it to research institutions, the
                    ESA, the German Aerospace Centre and various enterprises.
                    Nineteen developers participated anonymously in the survey.
                    "The results show us that the understanding of security in
                    the industry is different than in many other areas,
                    specifically that it's security by obscurity," concludes
                    Johannes Willbold. Many of the respondents therefore assumed
                    that satellites could not be attacked because there is no
                    documentation of the systems, i.e., nothing is known about
                    them. Only a few said that they encrypt data when
                    communicating with satellites or use authentication in order
                    to ensure that only the ground station is allowed to
                    communicate with the satellite.

                    Since 2011, California has significantly reformed its
                    criminal justice system, reducing the size of its prison
                    population, with no effect on violent crime and only
                    marginal impacts on property crime statewide. The COVID-19
                    pandemic furthered decarceration as the state reduced state
                    prison and jail populations to slow the spread of the virus.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Concerns emerged that releases under the auspices of COVID
                    mitigation harmed public safety. A new study explored this
                    notion and found no consistent relation between
                    COVID-19-related jail decarceration and violent or property
                    crime at the county level in the state.

                    "California's efforts to reduce overcrowding as a way to
                    limit the spread of COVID-19 reduced the correctional
                    population more severely and abruptly than any of the
                    state's previous decarceration reforms," according to Charis
                    E. Kubrin, professor of criminology, law, and society at UC
                    Irvine, who led the study. "Concerns about what impact these
                    actions would have on crime rates were widespread, and
                    although violent and property crime in large cities declined
                    during the pandemic, homicide and car theft rose
                    significantly."

                  <p>
                    Because these increases mirrored national trends, it was
                    unclear whether California's pandemic-related decarceration
                    efforts were responsible. In this study, researchers sought
                    to determine whether COVID-19 jail downsizing measures were
                    related to crime trends in the state, estimating the effect
                    of the measure on crime in the state's 58 counties and
                    isolating the impact of decarceration on crime from other
                    shocks affecting the state as a whole.

                    [...] The study did not find a consistent relation between
                    COVID-19 jail decarceration and crime at the county level,
                    suggesting that downsizing, on average, did not drive crime
                    increases statewide.

                    Among the study's limitations, the authors note that because
                    they used a synthetic control adaptation, the treated and
                    synthetic series did not reflect the fully treated and
                    completely untreated versions of county crime rates that are
                    generally produced via synthetic controls. The authors also
                    note they measured COVID-19 mitigation efforts only from
                    March through December 2020—a relatively short period—in
                    order to minimize the effects of crime associated with
                    summer 2020 protests following the murders of Breonna
                    Taylor, George Floyd, Jacob Blake, and others.

                    “If dystopian problems emerge, as some fear, the courts
                    stand ready to hear argument regarding how we should rein in
                    law enforcement’s use of rapidly advancing technology,” the
                    court ruled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not everyone on the court agreed. In a dissenting opinion,
                    Colorado judge Monica Marquez warned the court’s deflection
                    of responsibility would be seen as a green light for cops
                    around the country to pursue the suspect warrants with more
                    frequency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “At the risk of sounding alarmist, I fear that by upholding
                    this practice, the majority’s ruling today gives
                    constitutional cover to law enforcement seeking
                    unprecedented access to the private lives of individuals not
                    just in Colorado, but across the globe,” Marquez
                    <a
                      href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/colorado-court-upholds-google-keyword-search-warrant-led-104025578"
                      >wrote</a
                    >. “And I fear that today’s decision invites courts
                    nationwide to do the same.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Experts speaking with Gizmodo agreed, saying the court’s
                    decision to side with the police using a “good faith
                    exception” could give police an out to pursue cases using
                    the warrants without actually clarifying the murky legal
                    underbelly buried underneath.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If law enforcement doesn’t have clear standards or rules,
                    then their actions will be deemed in good faith,” Jake
                    Laperruque Deputy Director of the Center for Democracy &amp;
                    Technology’s Security &amp; Surveillance Project said in an
                    interview with Gizmodo. “Without any real clarity on what
                    standards or rules are for them, I expect the next [reverse
                    keyword warrant], even if it is deemed deficient, will be
                    allowed into evidence.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “What the good faith exception really does is it
                    incentivizes police to push the envelope as opposed to what
                    it was supposed to be for, which is to incentivize police to
                    adhere to constitutional limitations,” Granick of the ACLU
                    added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One group that definitely <em>did</em> appreciate the
                    court’s ruling was local law enforcement. In a statement
                    sent to Gizmodo, Denver District Attorney Beth McCann said
                    she was “very pleased” with the outcome.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The Court recognized that police officers exercised good
                    faith in obtaining the warrant that led to the
                    identification of the suspects,” McCann said. “We agree with
                    that part of the court’s opinion and will now move forward
                    with our cases.

                An interesting tidbit mentioned was that even notable

                <a

                  >Karl Pearson</a
                >
                did their own experiments:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Throughout history, several researchers have collected
                    thousands of coin flips. In the 18th century, the famed
                    naturalist Count de Buffon collected 2,048 uninterrupted
                    sequences of 'heads' in what is possibly the first
                    statistical experiment ever conducted. In the 19th century,
                    the statistician Karl Pearson flipped a coin 24,000 times to
                    obtain 12,012 tails. And in the 20th century, the
                    mathematician John Kerrich flipped a coin 10,000 times for a
                    total of 5,067 heads while interned in Nazi-occupied
                    Denmark. These experiments do not allow a test of the D-H-M
                    model, however, mostly because it was not recorded whether
                    the coin landed on the same side that it started. A notable
                    exception is a sequence of 40,000 coin flips collected by
                    Janet Larwood and Priscilla Ku in 2009: Larwood always
                    started the flips heads-up, and Ku always tails-up.
                    Unfortunately, the results (<em>i.e</em>., 10,231/20,000
                    heads by Larwood and 10,014/20,000 tails by Ku) do not
                    provide compelling evidence for or against the D-H-M
                    hypothesis.

                    Could future coin tossers use the same-side bias to their
                    advantage? The magnitude of the observed bias can be
                    illustrated using a betting scenario. If you bet a dollar on
                    the outcome of a coin toss (<em>i.e</em>., paying 1 dollar
                    to enter, and winning either 0 or 2 dollars depending on the
                    outcome) and repeat the bet 1,000 times, knowing the
                    starting position of the coin toss would earn you 19 dollars
                    on average. This is more than the casino advantage for 6
                    deck blackjack against an optimal-strategy player, where the
                    casino would make 5 dollars on a comparable bet, but less
                    than the casino advantage for single-zero roulette, where
                    the casino would make 27 dollars on average. These
                    considerations lead us to suggest that when coin flips are
                    used for high-stakes decision-making, the starting position
                    of the coin is best concealed.

                    An extreme drought in parts of the Amazon has led to a
                    dramatic drop in river water levels, exposing dozens of
                    usually submerged rock formations with carvings of human
                    forms that may date back some 2,000 years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The rock carvings are not usually visible because they
                    are covered by the waters of the Negro River, whose flow
                    recorded its lowest level in 121 years last week.

                    The surfacing of the engravings on the riverbank have
                    delighted scientists and the general public alike but also
                    raised unsettling questions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We come, we look at (the engravings) and we think they are
                    beautiful. But at the same time, it is worrying... I also
                    think about whether this river will exist in 50 or 100
                    years," Ribeiro said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to experts, the dry season has worsened this
                    year due to El Niño, an irregular climate pattern over the
                    Pacific Ocean that disrupts normal weather, adding to the
                    effect of climate change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The engravings comprise an archaeological site of "great
                    relevance," said Jaime Oliveira of the Brazilian Institute
                    of Historical Heritage (Iphan).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Most of the engravings are of human faces, some of
                    them rectangular and others oval, with smiles or grim
                    expressions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The site expresses emotions, feelings, it is an engraved
                    rock record, but it has something in common with current
                    works of art," said Oliveira.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Beatriz Carneiro, historian and member of Iphan, Praia
                    das Lajes has an "inestimable" value in understanding the
                    first people who inhabited the region, a field still little
                    explored.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Unhappily it is now reappearing with the worsening of the
                    drought," Carneiro said. "Having our rivers back (flooded)
                    and keeping the engravings submerged will help preserve
                    them, even more than our work."

                    are expected to debut in new CPUs in 2024 or 2025. However,
                    TSMC has already declared victory over the US company, with
                    plans to introduce comparable manufacturing technology
                    within the same timeframe, but with improvements across the

                    confirmed the enhancements of the N3P technology. TSMC's
                    3nm-class manufacturing node demonstrated "comparable PPA"
                    (power performance area) to Intel's 18A node. N3P is
                    expected to be even better, arriving earlier on the market,
                    boasting "better technology maturity," and offering
                    significant cost advantages.

                  <p>
                    Wei emphasized that TSMC doesn't underestimate or take the
                    competition lightly. He also mentioned that the company's
                    2-nanometer technology, while still a work in progress, is
                    expected to surpass both N3P and 18A. TSMC's

                  <p>
                    [...] Wei mentioned that N3 is expected to contribute to a
                    "mid-single-digit percentage" of TSMC's total wafer revenue
                    in 2023, with a significantly higher percentage anticipated
                    for 2024. There is strong demand for 3nm products from
                    various customers who are seeking improved performance,
                    power efficiency, yield, and "comprehensive platform
                    support" for both high-performance computing (HPC) and

                  <p>
                    According to Malwarebytes, which spotted the Notepad++
                    malvertising campaign, it has been live for several months
                    but managed to fly under the radar all this time.

                    The final payload delivered to victims is unknown, but
                    Malwarebytes says it's most likely Cobalt Strike, which
                    usually precedes highly damaging ransomware deployments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Notepad++ malvertizing campaign promotes URLs that are
                    obviously unrelated to the software project yet use
                    misleading titles displayed in Google Search result
                    advertisements.

                  <p>
                    [...] Once victims click on any of the ads, a redirection
                    step checks their IP to filter out users likely to be
                    crawlers, VPNs, bots, etc., leading them to a decoy site
                    that does not drop anything malicious.

                  <p>
                    In contrast, legitimate targets are redirected to
                    "notepadxtreme[.]com" which mimics the real Notepad++ site,
                    featuring download links for various versions of the text
                    editor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Victims who are marked as suitable targets are then
                    served an HTA script, which is assigned a unique ID, likely
                    to enable the attackers to track their infections. That
                    payload is served only once per victim, so a second visit
                    results in a 404 error.

                    double-check that you have landed on the official domain.

                    effects of life in space—an outstanding question highlighted
                    by the National Academies report.

                    The results of such studies would reveal a lot about whether
                    space settlements could ever become a reality. But to
                    Edelbroek, the fact that multigenerational studies on
                    animals have never been approved is the raison d'être for
                    his company. And while its research might make some people
                    uncomfortable, he sees pushing the boundaries as important.

                    comfort zone," he says. "And if you ask me, it's good to
                    continue to do that into space."

                    Apple's new iPhone 15 marks a disruptive departure from
                    previous models. The 11-year reign of the Lightning cable is
                    over, and the USB-C era has begun — leaving us wondering
                    what sets one charger apart from another.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Does Apple's Thunderbolt 4 cable really warrant its $129
                    price tag? Or does a $5 cable get the job done just as well?
                    We've used our Neptune industrial X-ray CT scanner to
                    uncover the hidden engineering differences between them.

                article is very light on details, but the pictures are
                interesting.

                    NASA's Lucy spacecraft is preparing for its first close-up
                    look at an asteroid. On Nov. 1, it will fly by asteroid
                    Dinkinesh and test its instruments in preparation for visits
                    in the next decade to multiple Trojan asteroids that circle
                    the sun in the same orbit as Jupiter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dinkinesh, less than half a mile, or 1 kilometer, wide,
                    circles the sun in the main belt of asteroids located
                    between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Lucy has been
                    visually tracking Dinkinesh since Sept. 3; it will be the
                    first of 10 asteroids Lucy will visit on its 12-year voyage.
                    To observe so many, Lucy will not stop or orbit the
                    asteroids, instead it will collect data as it speeds past
                    them in what is called a "flyby."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is the first time Lucy will be getting a close look at
                    an object that, up to this point, has only been an
                    unresolved smudge in the best telescopes," said Hal Levison,
                    Lucy principal investigator from the Southwest Research
                    Institute, which is headquartered in San Antonio. "Dinkinesh
                    is about to be revealed to humanity for the first time."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The primary aim of the Lucy mission, which launched Oct. 16,
                    2021, is to survey the Jupiter Trojan asteroids, a
                    never-before-explored population of small bodies that orbit
                    the sun in two "swarms" that lead and follow Jupiter in its
                    orbit. However, before Lucy gets to the Trojans, it will fly
                    by another main belt asteroid in 2025 called Donaldjohanson
                    for additional in-flight tests of the spacecraft systems and
                    procedures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] After the Dinkinesh encounter, the Lucy spacecraft
                    will continue in its orbit around the sun, returning to the
                    Earth's vicinity for its second gravity assist in December
                    2024. This push from Earth will send it back to the main
                    asteriod belt for its 2025 Donaldjohanson flyby, and then on
                    to the Jupiter Trojan asteroids in 2027.

                    moved to countries such as Russia and China and posed as

                    Special Agent in Charge Jay Greenberg of the FBI St. Louis
                    Division went so far as to say that any company that employs
                    freelance IT workers "more than likely" hired one of these
                    bad actors. "This scheme is so prevalent that companies must
                    be vigilant to verify whom they're hiring," Greenberg
                    stated. "At a minimum, the FBI recommends that employers
                    take additional proactive steps with remote IT workers to
                    make it harder for bad actors to hide their identities.
                    Without due diligence, companies risk losing money or being

                    >. Developed in 1912, the scale determines the heat of a
                    pepper by measuring the concentration of its heat-wielding
                    chemical compounds called capsaicinoids.

                  <p>
                    Pepper X measures an average of 2.693 million Scoville Heat
                    Units. A jalapeño, by comparison, measures just 2,000 to
                    8,000 SHUs, while a serrano can land between 10,000 and
                    23,000 SHUs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The previous record holder, the Carolina Reaper, which was
                    also developed by Currie, averaged 1.64 million SHUs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "But that scale's logarithmic, so it's more like three times
                    hotter than a Reaper," Currie said on the show.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Currie described the feeling of eating a whole Pepper X:
                    "There's an intense burn that happens immediately. Then your
                    head kind of feels like, 'Oh no! What's going on?' And then
                    your body just starts reacting. You get it in your arms, you
                    get it in your chest," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It has no real throat burn like the Reaper, but that comes
                    on later when you're in pain."

                    A team of astronomers claim to have detected the most

                    to date, which could be used to measure the matter between
                    galaxies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers first discovered the energy burst in June
                    2022 with the Australia Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder
                    (ASKAP) telescope. It is believed that the energy was
                    created from a powerful cosmic event that released the
                    equivalent of 30 years of our sun’s total emission in
                    milliseconds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The astronomers claim that this burst of energy is
                    older and further away than any other fast radio burst
                    detected to date. It is believed to have originated from a
                    small group of merging galaxies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team said that current methods for estimating the
                    mass of the universe give conflicting answers and challenge
                    the standard model of cosmology. But the latest discovery
                    suggests that these radio bursts can be used to measure the
                    “missing” matter between galaxies to accurately weigh up the
                    universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “If we count up the amount of normal matter in the Universe
                    – the atoms that we are all made of – we find that more than
                    half of what should be there today is missing,” said Prof
                    Ryan Shannon who co-led the study. “We think that the
                    missing matter is hiding in the space between galaxies, but
                    it may just be so hot and diffuse that it’s impossible to
                    see using normal techniques.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team said that in 2020, the late Australian astronomer
                    Jean-Pierre Macquart showed that fast radio bursts reveal
                    more diffuse gases between galaxies if they are further
                    away. The team claims their latest discovery helps to
                    confirm this Macquart relation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “While we still don’t know what causes these massive bursts
                    of energy, the paper confirms that fast radio bursts are
                    common events in the cosmos and that we will be able to use
                    them to detect matter between galaxies, and better
                    understand the structure of the universe.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the team believes that the latest result represents
                    the limit of what we can spot with modern telescopes and
                    that more powerful devices will be needed to measure more
                    distant fast radio bursts.

                    Two men this week confessed to deliberately bypassing
                    testing protocols that are essential to keeping nuclear
                    power plants safe. This happened not once, not twice, but
                    <em>29 times.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Miguel Marcial Amaro, 56, from Delaware, and Martin Ramos,
                    52, from Pennsylvania, both pleaded guilty to a single count
                    of making and using a materially false document, and aiding
                    and abetting the same, for their respective roles in
                    creating false calibration certs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And it wasn't just one nuclear plant where Marcial and Ramos
                    were cutting corners. According to the Justice Department's
                    Environment and Natural Resources Division, the duo faked
                    certs that would show acoustic emissions (AE) testing had
                    been done by calibrated instruments in several plants over a
                    period that stretched for over a decade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AE testing is important as it's how engineers can check the
                    structural integrity of components without shaking, moving,
                    or otherwise impacting their serviceability. The pair were
                    responsible for ascertaining their employer's AE testing kit
                    was compliant, with Marcial ensuring the equipment was
                    calibrated annually, and Ramos working under Marcial as an
                    engineer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Justice Department said in a felony notice filed
                    on September 25 that the AE testing equipment was used to
                    determine, "among other things, the structural integrity of
                    heavy-lifting components, such as cranes and rigging, that
                    handled critical components of a nuclear reactor, including
                    nuclear fuel."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AE testing works by mounting small sensors onto a component.
                    The component emits stress waves when you apply an external
                    stimulus, such as high pressure, loads, or temperatures. The
                    sensors detect these waves as they are emitted, converts
                    them into electrical signals, and then relays these to a
                    computer for processing. The notice adds that the process
                    assesses the structural integrity of components, including
                    whether there was any "infirmity, weakness, or damage."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The pair are scheduled to be sentenced on January 25
                    next year, with a federal district court judge determining
                    the length, which is max five years. The original indictment
                    is not public and it is not known what the men's motivation
                    for their actions could be.

                    The way you talk can reveal a lot about you—especially if
                    you're talking to a chatbot. New research reveals that
                    chatbots like ChatGPT can infer a lot of sensitive
                    information about the people they chat with, even if the
                    conversation is utterly mundane.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The phenomenon appears to stem from the way the models'
                    algorithms are trained with broad swathes of web content, a

                    work by finding statistical correlations, which will make it

                    However, opponents are calling it a power grab. Commissioner
                    Brendan Carr points to the 2017 repeal and the fact that the
                    internet "<a
                      href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-397801A1.pdf"

                    >" as an example of why the rules are unnecessary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When my FCC colleagues and I voted in 2017 to overturn the
                    Obama Administration's failed, two-year experiment with
                    Title II, activists and politicians alike guaranteed the
                    American public that the internet would quite literally
                    break without it," Carr said in a Wednesday statement, a day
                    before the vote. "Since that didn't happen, the FCC
                    shouldn't reimpose the rules now. We already have a free and
                    open internet today, without Title II."

                    Evan Swarztrauber, Senior Advisor at the

                      >Foundation for American Innovation</a
                    >, agrees with Carr. He points out that the fear-mongering
                    rhetoric failed to materialize after the 2017 repeal, and
                    internet service got better and cheaper when adjusted for
                    inflation. Swarztrauber also believes that the FCC is
                    barking up the wrong tree.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Even though the Title II rules passed the vote, the
                    issue is far from over. The Commission will now open the
                    proposal up for public

                    revisions prompted by sound arguments and feedback, the FCC
                    will vote again.

                    If passed, it will most assuredly face legal challenges just
                    as the first implementation and the subsequent repeal did.
                    In both cases, the courts upheld the FCC's decision, saying

                    NASA announced on Thursday that the first-ever crewed test
                    flight of Boeing's much-delayed Starliner spacecraft will
                    launch no earlier than mid-April, 2024.

                    The mission – dubbed Crew Flight Test (CFT) – will see test
                    pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni William travel to the
                    International Space Station (ISS) and back to try out
                    Boeing's reusable capsule. The Starliner will be launched on
                    a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral
                    Space Force Station in Florida and transport the astronauts
                    on an eight-day trip.

                    SpaceX is up and running, having first launched astronauts

                    [...] Meanwhile, the mechanism that connects the parachute
                    to the capsule – needed to slow the Starliner's speed so it
                    can safely land on Earth – has had to be redesigned after it
                    broke apart in tests. The issue has plagued Boeing for a
                    while, and was one of the main reasons it had to push back
                    its first-ever crewed flight back in June.

                    After more than 40 years studying humans and other primates,
                    Sapolsky has reached the conclusion that virtually all human
                    behaviour is as far beyond our conscious control as the
                    convulsions of a seizure, the division of cells or the
                    beating of our hearts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This means accepting that a man who shoots into a crowd has
                    no more control over his fate than the victims who happen to
                    be in the wrong place at the wrong time. It means treating
                    drunk drivers who barrel into pedestrians just like drivers
                    who suffer a sudden heart attack and veer out of their lane.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sapolsky, a MacArthur "genius" grant winner, is extremely
                    aware that this is an out-there position. Most
                    neuroscientists believe humans have at least some degree of
                    free will. So do most philosophers and the vast majority of
                    the general population. Free will is essential to how we see
                    ourselves, fueling the satisfaction of achievement or the
                    shame of failing to do the right thing.

                    [...] Analyzing human behavior through the lens of any
                    single discipline leaves room for the possibility that
                    people choose their actions, he says. But after a long
                    cross-disciplinary career, he feels it's intellectually
                    dishonest to write anything other than what he sees as the
                    unavoidable conclusion: Free will is a myth, and the sooner
                    we accept that, the more just our society will be.

                    "Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst," which
                    won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and a slew of other

                  <p>
                    According to The Times, there are several issues with access
                    to public trial exhibits on both sides. The Department of
                    Justice has failed to post at least 68 exhibits on its
                    website that were shared in the trial, The Times alleged,
                    and states have not provided access to 18 records despite
                    reporters' requests.<br />[...]<br />Currently, The Times
                    said it is seeking to unseal redactions in two exhibits, and
                    it remains "unclear why the exhibits have been redacted"
                    because "they date to 2007 and relate to a version of an
                    agreement between Apple and Google that has not been
                    operative for more than a decade."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps most notably, The Times has also asked the court to
                    unseal testimony
                    <a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The Court has upheld redactions to certain transcripts in
                    the absence of a showing by the parties on the public record
                    that the sealing is justified and without providing its own
                    'full explanation of the basis for the redactions," The
                    Times alleged, "even though some of the redactions have been
                    applied to material that is both of great public interest
                    and goes to the core of the litigation."

                    standard ASCII text. Looking carefully, it's easy to spot
                    the small comma-like figure immediately below the k. When it
                    appears in an address bar, the figure is equally easy to

                    Being announced today by AMD for a November 21st launch,
                    this morning AMD is taking the wraps off of their Ryzen 7000
                    Threadripper CPUs. These high-end chips are being split up
                    into two product lines, with AMD assembling the
                    workstation-focused Ryzen Threadripper 7000 Pro series, as
                    well as the non-pro Ryzen Threadripper 7000 series for the
                    more consumer-ish high-end desktop (HEDT) market. Both chip
                    lines are based on AMD's tried and true Zen 4 architecture –
                    derivatives of AMD's EPYC server processors – incorporating
                    AMD's Zen 4 chiplets and a discrete I/O dies. As with
                    previous generations of Threadripper parts, we're
                    essentially looking at the desktop version of AMD's EPYC
                    hardware.

                    Then why is this method of dispersal not seen in other
                    insects? The Kobe University researcher explains, "The eggs
                    of most insect species are typically fertilized just before
                    being laid, relying on sperm stored within the female
                    insects after copulation. However, in some stick insect
                    species, females are parthenogenic, that is, they can
                    produce viable eggs without fertilization." It is only
                    because of this quirk in their nature that viable stick
                    insect babies can hatch from the eggs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is important to keep in mind that stick insects are
                    called that way precisely because their main strategy of
                    survival is not being eaten by their predators, as opposed
                    to many plants that rely on their fruit being ingested and
                    thus their seeds being dispersed by animals. Nevertheless,
                    Suetsugu explains the importance of this result for the
                    scientific community: "This finding invites researchers to
                    delve deeper into the mechanisms of dispersal in various
                    species and challenge long-held assumptions about the fate
                    of organisms devoured by predators."

                    Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) consume only about 10% of the
                    electricity required by traditional incandescent lights and
                    last up to 25 times longer, so it's no surprise that they
                    have become commonplace over the past two decades.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But there is a downside to LEDs: They're much brighter than
                    old-fashioned energy-guzzling light bulbs. When an entire
                    city gets fitted with energy-saving LED lamps, this bright
                    light scatters through

                    and makes the sky glow with greater intensity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A study published earlier this year found that
                    <a
                      href="https://www.space.com/light-pollution-makes-stars-disappear"

                    >
                    at an average rate of 10% per year. This trend affects even
                    the world's most remote observatories. Germany-based startup
                    StealthTransit recently tested a solution to this growing
                    issue.

                    "Unfortunately, this problem haunts almost all observatories
                    today," Vlad Pashkovsky, StealthTransit's founder and CEO,
                    told Space.com in an email. "Modern telescopes are highly
                    sensitive and feel the impact of outdoor lighting of cities
                    located at the distance of 50 or even 200 kilometers [30 to
                    120 miles]. This means that virtually every observatory on
                    <a

                    either already needs, or will need in the future 10 years,
                    protection from the light of large cities."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    StealthTransit's solution relies on three components: A
                    simple device that makes LED lights flicker at a very high
                    frequency that is imperceptible to the human eye, a GPS
                    receiver, and a specially designed shutter on the
                    telescope's camera that can blink in sync with the LED
                    lights. The GPS technology guides the telescope's shutter to
                    open only during the fleeting moments when the LED lights
                    are switched off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The experiments, conducted at an observatory in the Caucasus
                    Mountains in Russia, showed that the technology, dubbed the
                    DarkSkyProtector, could reduce unwanted sky glow in
                    astronomical images by 94%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It might sound impractical to refit an entire town
                    with devices that allow lamps to blink, but Pashkovsky said
                    that most existing LED lights can operate in the blinking
                    mode and that new lamps designed specifically with sky
                    protection in mind would be no costlier than existing LED
                    technology. The most expensive element of the
                    DarkSkyProtector system is the telescope shutter, which
                    needs to be lightweight and agile enough to blink about 150
                    times per second.

                    ago. The Talos team members said that they have seen devices

                  <p>
                    One of the most striking areas on Mars is its Noctis
                    Labyrinthus—Latin for the "Labyrinth of Night." It lies
                    between Mars's Valles Marineris and the gigantic volcanoes
                    of the Tharsis Bulge.

                  <p>
                    This shattered terrain is a system of valleys that stretch
                    out across nearly 1,200 kilometers. Scientists combined
                    ESA's Mars Express images into an amazing flyover of this
                    terrain, giving us a tasty hint of what future explorers
                    will see.

                  <p>
                    [...] It's cool to think of Mars Express focusing a
                    high-resolution movie camera on the surface. However, this
                    movie comprises many individual images. The views come from
                    more than eight Mars Express orbits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to images, the team combined images with
                    topographic information from a digital terrain model. That
                    helped the visualization team generate a three-dimensional
                    landscape, with every second of the video comprising 50
                    separate frames rendered according to a pre-defined camera
                    path.

                  <p>
                    In addition to showing the ancient history of Mars terrain,
                    the video also shows some Mars Express history. The opening
                    credits (Mars globe, first 24 seconds) were created using
                    the recent 20-year Mars global color mosaic.

                    Haze has been added to conceal the limits of the terrain
                    model. It starts building up at a distance of between 150
                    and 200 km. The video is centered at the Martian coordinates
                    of 7°S, 265°E.

                  <p>
                    You might think of the Intel 386 processor (1985) as just an
                    early processor in the x86 line, but the 386 was a critical
                    turning point for modern computing in several ways.1 First,
                    the 386 moved the x86 architecture to 32 bits, defining the
                    dominant computing architecture for the rest of the 20th
                    century. The 386 also established the overwhelming
                    importance of x86, not just for Intel, but for the entire
                    computer industry. Finally, the 386 ended IBM's control over
                    the PC market, turning Compaq into the architectural leader.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The 80386 was a major advancement over the 286: it
                    implemented a 32-bit architecture, added more instructions,
                    and supported 4-gigabyte segments. The 386 is a complicated
                    processor (by 1980s standards), with 285,000 transistors,
                    ten times the number of the original 8086.4 The 386 has
                    eight logical units that are pipelined5 and operate mostly
                    autonomously.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The design process of the 386 is interesting because
                    it illustrates Intel's migration to automated design systems
                    and heavier use of simulation.23 At the time, Intel was
                    behind the industry in its use of tools so the leaders of
                    the 386 realized that more automation would be necessary to
                    build a complex chip like the 386 on schedule. By making a
                    large investment in automated tools, the 386 team completed
                    the design ahead of schedule. Along with proprietary CAD
                    tools, the team made heavy use of standard Unix tools such
                    as sed, awk, grep, and make to manage the various design
                    databases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Once the processor was released, the problems weren't
                    over.25 Some early 386 processors had a 32-bit multiply
                    problem, where some arguments would unpredictably produce
                    the wrong results under particular
                    temperature/voltage/frequency conditions. (This is unrelated
                    to the famous Pentium FDIV bug that cost Intel $475
                    million.) The root cause was a layout problem, not a logic
                    problem; they didn't allow enough margin to handle the worst
                    case data in combination with manufacturing process and
                    environment factors. This tricky problem didn't show up in
                    simulation or chip verification, but was only found in
                    stress testing.

                    The Space Age is leaving fingerprints on one of the most
                    remote parts of the planet—the stratosphere—which has
                    potential implications for climate, the ozone layer and the
                    continued habitability of Earth.
                  </p>

                    Using tools hitched to the nose cone of their research
                    planes and sampling more than 11 miles above the planet's
                    surface, researchers have discovered significant amounts of
                    metals in aerosols in the atmosphere, likely from
                    increasingly frequent launches and returns of spacecraft and
                    satellites. That mass of metal is changing atmospheric
                    chemistry in ways that may impact Earth's atmosphere and
                    ozone layer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are finding this human-made material in what we consider
                    a pristine area of the atmosphere," said Dan Cziczo, one of
                    a team of scientists who published a study on these results
                    in the
                    <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>. "And
                    if something is changing in the stratosphere—this stable
                    region of the atmosphere—that deserves a closer look."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cziczo, professor and head of the Department of Earth,
                    Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences in Purdue's College of
                    Science, is an expert in atmospheric science who has spent
                    decades studying this rarefied region.
                  </p>

                    Led by Dan Murphy, an adjunct professor in the Department of
                    Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences and a researcher
                    at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the
                    team detected more than 20 elements in ratios that mirror
                    those used in spacecraft alloys.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found that the mass of lithium, aluminum, copper and
                    lead from spacecraft reentry far exceeded those metals found
                    in natural cosmic dust. Nearly 10% of large sulfuric acid
                    particles—the particles that help protect and buffer the
                    ozone layer—contained aluminum and other spacecraft metals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists estimate that as many as 50,000 more satellites
                    may reach orbit by 2030. The team calculates that means
                    that, in the next few decades, up to half of stratospheric
                    sulfuric acid particles would contain metals from reentry.
                    What effect that could have on the atmosphere, the ozone
                    layer and life on Earth is yet to be understood.

                    Silence might not be deafening, but it's something that
                    literally can be heard, concludes a team of philosophers and
                    psychologists who used auditory illusions to reveal how
                    moments of silence distort people's perception of time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings address the debate of whether people can hear
                    more than sounds, which has puzzled philosophers for
                    centuries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We typically think of our sense of hearing as being
                    concerned with sounds. But silence, whatever it is, is not a
                    sound—it's the absence of sound," said lead author Rui Zhe
                    Goh, a Johns Hopkins University graduate student in
                    philosophy and psychology. "Surprisingly, what our work
                    suggests is that nothing is also something you can hear."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team adapted well-known auditory illusions to create
                    versions in which the sounds of the original illusions were
                    replaced by moments of silence. For example, one illusion
                    made a sound seem much longer than it really was. In the
                    team's new silence-based illusion, an equivalent moment of
                    silence also seemed longer than it really was.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fact that these silence-based illusions produced exactly
                    the same results as their sound-based counterparts suggests
                    that people hear silence just as they hear sounds, the
                    researchers said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "There's at least one thing that we hear that isn't a
                    sound, and that's the silence that happens when sounds go
                    away," said co-author Ian Phillips, a Bloomberg
                    Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Psychological and
                    Brain Sciences. "The kinds of illusions and effects that
                    look like they are unique to the auditory processing of a
                    sound, we also get them with silences, suggesting we really
                    do hear absences of sound too."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings establish a new way to study the perception of
                    absence, the team said.

                    A prominent cryptography expert has told New Scientist that
                    a US spy agency could be weakening a new generation of
                    algorithms designed to protect against hackers equipped with
                    quantum computers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <a href="https://cr.yp.to/djb.html">Daniel Bernstein</a> at
                    the University of Illinois Chicago says that the US National
                    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is deliberately
                    obscuring the level of involvement the US National Security
                    Agency (NSA) has in developing new encryption standards for
                    "post-quantum cryptography" (PQC). He also believes that
                    NIST has made errors – either accidental or deliberate – in
                    calculations describing the security of the new standards.
                    NIST denies the claims.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "NIST isn't following procedures designed to stop NSA from
                    weakening PQC," says Bernstein. "People choosing
                    cryptographic standards should be transparently and
                    verifiably following clear public rules so that we don't
                    need to worry about their motivations. NIST promised
                    transparency and then claimed it had shown all its work, but
                    that claim simply isn't true."

                    to standardise a new generation of algorithms that resist
                    their attacks. Bernstein, who
                    <a href="https://archive.ph/BHGOM"
                      >coined the term post-quantum cryptography</a
                    >
                    in 2003 to refer to these kinds of algorithms, says the NSA
                    is actively engaged in putting secret weaknesses into new
                    encryption standards that will allow them to be more easily
                    cracked with the right knowledge. NIST's standards are used
                    globally, so flaws could have a large impact.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bernstein alleges that NIST's calculations for one of the
                    upcoming PQC standards, Kyber512, are "glaringly wrong",
                    making it appear more secure than it really is. He says that
                    NIST multiplied two numbers together when it would have been
                    more correct to add them, resulting in an artificially high
                    assessment of Kyber512's robustness to attack.
