                    [...] The discovery is Webb's first detection of complex
                    molecules in the early universe — a milestone moment that
                    Spilker sees as a beginning rather than an end.

                    "These are early days for the Webb Telescope, so astronomers
                    are excited to see all the new things it can do for us,"
                    Spilker said. "Detecting smoke in a galaxy early in the
                    history of the universe? Webb makes this look easy. Now that
                    we've shown this is possible for the first time, we're
                    looking forward to trying to understand whether it's really
                    true that where there's smoke, there's fire. Maybe we'll
                    even be able to find galaxies that are so young that complex
                    molecules like these haven't had time to form in the vacuum
                    of space yet, so galaxies are all fire and no smoke. The
                    only way to know for sure is to look at more galaxies,
                    hopefully even further away than this one."

                    Currently, two of the biggest industry drivers of metaverse
                    development are Meta (formerly Facebook, which believed in
                    the technology so much it rebranded itself) and Microsoft,
                    both of which contributed to the study. Meta has been
                    focusing on individual experiences, such as gaming, while
                    Microsoft specializes in business solutions, including
                    remote conferencing and distance learning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These findings could help policymakers understand how
                    metaverse industry growth can accelerate progress towards
                    achieving net-zero emissions targets and spur more flexible
                    decarbonization strategies. Metaverse-based remote working,
                    distance learning and virtual tourism could be promoted to
                    improve air quality. In addition to alleviating air
                    pollutant emissions, the reduction of transportation and
                    commercial energy usage could help transform the way energy
                    is distributed, with more energy supply going towards the
                    residential sector.

                    On I Love Lucy, whenever Lucy or Ricky Ricardo gave out
                    their phone number, they'd say it as "Murray Hill 5-9975."
                    Even though that may look and sound like gibberish to modern
                    phone-users, it was perfectly normal at the time. Lucy, you
                    got some 'splaining to do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Phone numbers looked like this in the middle of the 20th
                    century because of telephone exchanges—the hubs through
                    which an area's calls would be routed. Phone subscribers
                    were given a unique five-digit number within their service
                    area. These would be preceded by two digits, which were
                    identified by letters, that denoted the telephone exchange
                    you were connected to. (Before the 1950s, some cities used
                    three letters and four numbers, while others had two letters
                    and three numbers. The two letter, five number format—or
                    "2L-5N"—was eventually standardized throughout the country).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because these telephone exchanges could only facilitate
                    around 10,000 subscribers, many large cities had multiple
                    hubs. The Ricardo's MUrray Hill5-9975 meant their number was
                    685-9975 ("Hill" and its capital H served purely as a
                    mnemonic), with the 68, or "MU," representing the east side
                    of Manhattan's telephone exchange. This is also why phones
                    still have letters over the numbers (three over 2 through 8,
                    and four over 9).

                    A high ratio of cesium-135 to cesium-137 is a telltale sign
                    that the isotopes came from nuclear weapons rather than
                    nuclear reactors. Radioactive cesium-135 is created when
                    xenon-135, a product of the nuclear fission of uranium,
                    decays without absorbing a neutron. In nuclear reactors, the
                    level of xenon-135 is controlled and converted to its stable
                    form of xenon-136 through neutron absorption. In the case of
                    nuclear weapons, however, xenon-135 is left to proliferate,
                    and it leads to higher levels of radioactive cesium-135.

                    [...] The researchers calculated that between 10 and 68
                    percent of the cesium contamination in the wild boar samples
                    are from nuclear weapons testing. "Although Chernobyl has
                    been widely believed to be the prime source of [cesium-137]
                    in wild boars, we find that 'old' [cesium-137] from weapons
                    fallout significantly contributes to the total level in
                    those specimens that exceeded the regulatory limit," they
                    wrote.

                    Now, the team is warning against the detrimental long
                    lasting effects of nuclear weapons and nuclear reactor
                    disasters on food safety. Countries like the US, Soviet
                    Union, and UK conducted thousands of nuclear weapons tests
                    during the Cold War from the 1940s to 1990s. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "An important takeaway is that the long-forgotten
                    atmospheric nuclear weapons tests and their fallout still
                    cast a shadow on the environment," Steinhauser told us.

                  <p>
                    "Just because they took place 60 years ago doesn't mean that
                    they no longer impact the ecosystem. Monitoring of wild
                    boars will remain necessary (then there is no problem eating
                    them). We must take good care of our planet and avoid any
                    further releases. These may create a snowball effect."

                    architecture or the Softbank-owned outfit that develops it,
                    keep the British CPU designer's name out of the domain name

                    [...] Strictly speaking, the letter went to the web host
                    provider for her Arm-related websites, who passed it onto
                    Markstedter to handle. The missive demanded that the website
                    come down as it featured Arm's "Arm" trademark in the domain
                    name.

                    [...] Arm's rush to snatch up domain names is somewhat
                    ironic, considering that in 2018 the biz create the website
                    riscv-basics.com and used it to host content smearing rival
                    RISC-V architecture and list multiple reasons why Arm's tech
                    is superior. Arm pulled the dot-com after an internal revolt
                    by its staff, and the domain has since lapsed into someone
                    else's hands.

                    Arm's takedown comes just a week after the Neoverse designer
                    officially filed for an IPO on the US Nasdaq. In the filing,
                    Arm disclosed numerous risk factors, including many related
                    to its operations in China. However, we don't recall any
                    mention of experts writing tutorials about its ISA as
                    something Arm thinks investors need to worry about.

                    Until now, the hard-shelled egg was thought to be the key to
                    the success of the amniotes - a group of vertebrates that
                    undergo embryonic or foetal development within an amnion, a
                    protective membrane inside the egg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, a fresh study of 51 fossil species and 29 living
                    species which could be categorised as oviparous (laying hard
                    or soft-shelled eggs) or viviparous (giving birth to live
                    young) suggests otherwise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings, published today in Nature Ecology &amp;
                    Evolution, show that all the great evolutionary branches of
                    Amniota, namely Mammalia, Lepidosauria (lizards and
                    relatives), and Archosauria (dinosaurs, crocodilians, birds)
                    reveal viviparity and extended embryo retention in their
                    ancestors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Extended embryo retention (EER) is when the young are
                    retained by the mother for a varying amount of time, likely
                    depending on when conditions are best for survival.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the hard-shelled egg has often been seen as one of the
                    greatest innovations in evolution, this research implies it
                    was EER that gave this particular group of animals the
                    ultimate protection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "EER is common and variable in lizards and snakes
                    today. Their young can be released, either inside an egg or
                    as little wrigglers, at different developmental stages, and
                    there appears to be ecological advantages of EER, perhaps
                    allowing the mothers to release their young when
                    temperatures are warm enough and food supplies are rich."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Professor Benton concluded: "Our work, and that of many
                    others in recent years, has consigned the classic 'reptile
                    egg' model of the textbooks to the wastebasket.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The first amniotes had evolved extended embryo retention
                    rather than a hard-shelled egg to protect the developing
                    embryo for a lesser or greater amount of time inside the
                    mother, so birth could be delayed until environments become
                    favourable.

                  <p>
                    "Whether the first amniote babies were born in parchment
                    eggs or as live, snapping little insect-eaters is unknown,
                    but this adaptive parental protection gave them the
                    advantage over spawning earlier tetrapods."

                    [...] One unproven theory is that day length might have
                    stalled at a constant value in Earth's distant past. In
                    addition to tides in the ocean related to the pull of the
                    Moon, Earth also has solar tides related to the atmosphere
                    heating up during daytime.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Solar atmospheric tides are not as strong as lunar oceanic
                    tides, but this would not always have been the case. When
                    Earth was rotating faster in the past, the tug of the Moon
                    would have been much weaker. Unlike the pull of the Moon,
                    the Sun's tide instead pushes Earth. So while the Moon slows
                    Earth's rotation down, the Sun speeds it up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Because of this, if in the past these two opposite forces
                    were to have become been equal to each other, such a tidal
                    resonance would have caused Earth's day length to stop
                    changing and to have remained constant for some time," said
                    Kirscher.

                    Earth's day length appears to have stopped its long-term
                    increase and flatlined at about 19 hours roughly between two
                    to one billion years ago—"the billion years," Mitchell
                    noted, "commonly referred to as the 'boring' billion."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The timing of the stalling intriguingly lies between the two
                    largest rises in oxygen. Timothy Lyons of the University
                    California, Riverside, who was not involved in the study,
                    said, "It's fascinating to think that the evolution of the
                    Earth's rotation could have affected the evolving
                    composition of the atmosphere."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new study thus supports the idea that Earth's rise to
                    modern oxygen levels had to wait for longer days for
                    photosynthetic bacteria to generate more oxygen each day.

                    Instead, the researchers behind the new study suggests a new
                    theory of how Earth was created.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There was a disk around the young Sun where the planets
                    were growing. The disk was filled with small dust particles.
                    Once a planet reaches a certain size, it sorts of act like a
                    vacuum cleaner, sucking up all that dust very quickly. And
                    that makes it grow to the size of Earth in just a few
                    million years," says Ph.D. student Isaac Onyett, who is the
                    corresponding author of the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This vacuuming of small dust particles not only played a
                    vital role in Earth's formation but made sure that water was
                    delivered to our planet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The disk also contains many icy particles. As the vacuum
                    cleaner effect draws in the dust, it also captures a portion
                    of the ice. This process contributes to the presence of
                    water during Earth's formation, rather than relying on a
                    chance event delivering water 100 million years later," says
                    Isaac Onyett.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With the new knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms
                    there is a much greater chance of water being present on
                    other planets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This theory would predict that whenever you form a planet
                    like Earth, you will have water on it. If you go to another
                    planetary system where there is a planet orbiting a star the
                    size of the Sun, then the planet should have water if it is
                    in the right distance," says Martin Bizzarro.

                    The International Gemini Observatory, a key player in global
                    astronomical research, has temporarily halted astronomical
                    operations following a cyberattack. The culprits and their
                    motives remain unknown.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The computer hack, which took place on the morning of August
                    1, led to the suspension of the Gemini North and South
                    Telescopes, as detailed in an August 24 statement from the
                    National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory
                    (NOIRLab). While the North telescope is situated in Hawaii,
                    its southern counterpart is located on Cerro Pachón, Chili,
                    with a few other smaller telescopes located in Cerro Tololo,
                    also in Chile. Observatories stationed on Arizona’s Kitt
                    Peak, however, remain unaffected by the intrusion, according
                    to NOIRLab.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “Like the entire astronomy community, we are
                    disappointed that some of our telescopes are not currently
                    observing. Fortunately, we have been able to keep some
                    telescopes online and collect data with in-person
                    workarounds,” NOIRLab stated in its release. “We are
                    grateful for the support of the astronomy community during
                    this difficult time and we thank everyone for their patience
                    as our teams continue to work towards restoring normal
                    operations.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For the time being, Gemini North has been securely
                    positioned in its zenith-pointing orientation. NOIRLab
                    credits the prompt actions of its security team for
                    preventing any damage to the observatory. As to who is
                    responsible for the hacks, or their motivations, that
                    remains either unknown or undisclosed. NOIRLab has been
                    tight-lipped about the incident, claiming that it is
                    “limited” in what it can share about its “cybersecurity
                    controls and investigatory findings.”

                    that of its host, and thereby help the immune system better

                  <p>
                    I recently bought an LG ULTRAGEAR monitor secondhand off of
                    a coworker. I really love it and it's been great so far, but
                    I ran into some minor issues with it in Linux. It works
                    great on both Mac and Windows, but on Linux it displays just
                    a black panel until I use the second monitor to go in and
                    reduce the refresh rate down to 60 Hz.
                  </p>
                  <p>This has worked decent so far but there's some issues:</p>
                  <p>
                    It doesn't work while linux is booting up. The motherboards
                    boot sequence is visible just fine, but as soon as control
                    is handed over to Linux and I'd normally see a splash screen
                    while I'm waiting for my login window, I see nothing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It doesn't work on the login screen. This would be fine if
                    login consistently worked on my second screen, but I need to
                    manually switch the cables between my work computer and the
                    desktop for the second screen and sometimes I don't feel
                    like doing that. Even when I switch the cables, the second
                    screen seems to be moody and doesn't always show the login
                    screen either.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once I've logged in and fixed the settings on my second
                    screen it seems to go fine, unless I actually unplug the
                    second screen. If I do, it looks like the graphics settings
                    go reset back to default (settings that don't work) and I
                    lose the main monitor too.
                  </p>

                    Scientists have been working on models of planet formation
                    since before we knew exoplanets existed. Originally guided
                    by the properties of the planets in our Solar System, these
                    models turned out to be remarkably good at also accounting
                    for exoplanets without an equivalent in our Solar System,
                    like super Earths and hot Neptunes. Add in the ability of
                    planets to move around thanks to gravitational interactions,
                    and the properties of exoplanets could usually be accounted
                    for.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today, a large international team of researchers is
                    announcing the discovery of something our models can't
                    explain. It's roughly Neptune's size but four times more
                    massive. Its density—well above that of iron—is compatible
                    with either the entire planet being almost entirely solid or
                    it having an ocean deep enough to drown entire planets.
                    While the people who discovered it offer a couple of
                    theories for its formation, neither is especially likely.

                From a pool of 32 university-level courses from eight
                disciplines, from political science to computer science, the
                average university student is being surpassed by ChatGPT.
                Exceptions in Maths, which is odd since it's basically a giant
                calculator, and with tick questions, that it apparently can't
                identify and detect properly.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is not made clear the level of the courses beyond that it
                mainly appears to be undergraduate courses, there should still
                be a difference between first and last year in level. Perhaps
                there is a difference from first year courses where it's mostly
                a matter of reciting known facts and data to the later half when
                the requirements of more critical thinking and interpretation
                and analysis is required.

                Other findings include that AI plagiarism detecting is poor and
                mostly unable to tell which text was written by a human and
                which is regurgitated AI text blobs.

                Alternatively it could also be that the average student have
                just gotten worse over the years. The bottom end of the spectrum
                has increased as more and more students are forced into
                academia.

                My understanding is that ATCS was unencrypted and could be
                easily monitored in the locations where it was installed. Not
                all locations had ATCS installed, meaning that some subdivisions
                might have ATCS while others did not. More recently, companies
                like BNSF have been

                >. Although the encryption provides a greater level of security,
                and presumably systems still are engineered to default to
                stopping trains if the signaling systems aren't functioning,
                these changes also make it much more difficult to track the
                movement of trains for anyone who doesn't have the encryption
                keys.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps I'm misunderstanding some aspect of the system, but is
                there anything that would prevent a radio-based signaling system
                from using public key encryption? For example, a company like
                BNSF would have a private key for signals from their dispatchers
                and trains. Any trains operating on one of BNSF's subdivisions,
                whether BNSF, UP, Amtrak, or any other trains could then use
                BNSF's public key to decrypt the signals, verify that they were
                actually sent by the dispatcher, and then act accordingly on the
                signal. Any trains operating on the subdivision could use their
                owner's private key to send their location, speed, and any other
                information. For example, an Amtrak train operating on a BNSF
                subdivision would use the Amtrak private key to encrypt their
                data, but anyone with Amtrak's public key, including the BNSF
                dispatcher, could verify that the data was actually sent by the
                Amtrak train. This seems like it would make interoperability
                easier because it wouldn't require sharing the private key with
                other train operators using BNSF's subdivisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Public keys could be freely shared with everyone, meaning that
                the public could also monitor train locations and signals but
                would not easily be able to spoof the signals. It would be
                necessary to ensure that the signaling system wouldn't be
                vulnerable to recording and repeating an earlier encrypted
                command, but it's not clear that a public key system would be
                inherently more vulnerable to a repetition attack. I am curious
                if anyone knows why a system like this isn't implemented on US
                railroads, which should prevent attacks like what happened in
                Poland, but without locking out the public from monitoring train
                signals.

                    [...] Increased screen time can also affect the child’s
                    ability to be bored, Hutton told CNN, adding that boredom
                    breeds creativity and allows the child to pacify themselves,
                    rather than becoming reliant on a screen.

                    “Longer term, one of the real goals is for kids just to be
                    able to sit quietly in their own thoughts,” Hutton told the
                    outlet. “When they’re allowed to be a little bit bored for a
                    second, they get a little uncomfortable, but then they’re
                    like, ‘OK, I want to make myself more comfortable.’ And
                    that’s how creativity happens.”

                    said more screen time can also reduce a child’s ability to
                    build empathy, saying: “For a brain to develop and grow, it
                    needs essential stimuli from the outside world. More
                    importantly, they need time to process those stimuli.” It
                    added: “Exposure to screens reduces babies’ ability to read
                    human emotion and control their frustration. … It also
                    detracts from activities that help boost their brain power,
                    like playing and interacting with other children.”

                Scientists have solved the mystery of why tens of thousands of
                octopuses cluster on the foothills of a giant underwater
                mountain, two miles down off the coast of California. The pearl
                octopuses, so named because from a distance they look like
                scattered gems, seek out warm water seeping through the seabed
                and use it to speed up the hatching of their eggs<br />...<br />The
                mauve, grapefruit-sized female octopuses each lay about 60 eggs
                and cement them to the bare rock, then guard them until they
                hatch. Temperature probes showed the water bathing the eggs
                ranged from 5C to 10C (40-50F), while less than a metre away it
                dropped to a frigid 1.6C.
              </p>
              <p>
                Revisiting individual nests, the team saw that rather than
                taking a decade or longer to hatch, as would happen in the very
                cold deep sea, baby octopuses emerge from their cosy nests after
                less than two years, dramatically boosting their chances of
                survival.

                    <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/excel">Anaconda</a> to
                    bring libraries like Pandas, Statsmodels, and Matplotlib
                    into Excel. Python in Excel runs on Microsoft's cloud
                    servers, and the company is touting

                      >the security that should offer</a
                    >. Python runs in isolated containers, with no access to
                    devices, your network, or user tokens, Microsoft states.
                    Python and Excel can only really talk to each other through
                    limited functions—xl() and =PY()—that can only return code
                    results, not macros, VBA code, or other data, Microsoft
                    claims.

                    [...] It will be interesting to see how Python's integration
                    into Excel works out. It's a very specialized, cloud-hosted,
                    and seemingly containerized and secured code offering. But
                    Office apps' history with Visual Basic for Applications
                    (VBA) scripts and macros has a long history of exploits,
                    patches, and more exploits. Early last year, Microsoft

                    Barring that, it's an intriguing expansion of a code

                Secure your domain name for the next 100 years with Wordpress, a
                company that has only been around for about 20 years.<br />For
                only $38k including hosting fees and domain name. It's not
                exactly cheap, but I guess they had to include the cost of
                inflation and other increases for the next 100 years.

                Still unsure what is the weirdest part of it -- that they in
                general believe the system with domain names will be around in a
                century or that Wordpress will still be around. Also do you have
                to pay the century fee in advance or is it an installment plan
                per year or decade or? Not sure I would care to plonk down $38k
                at once for a domain name.

                Is this the future of the web? A necropolis of dead sites that
                never update. Who is there to secure that you actually remain
                online after death? Beyond trust and that you are hoping that
                Wordpress remains online.

                    [...] In recent months, Microsoft has come under blistering
                    criticism for security practices that led to the breach of
                    dozens of accounts belonging to customers using the
                    company's Azure and Exchange cloud offerings. What's
                    arguably worse has been the company's opaque notifications
                    of those events and the role Microsoft played in their
                    origins. The CEO and chairman of security firm Tenable, Amit
                    Yoran, recently said the company's security was mired in
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/microsoft-cloud-security-blasted-for-its-culture-of-toxic-obfuscation/"
                      >"grossly irresponsible" practices</a
                    >
                    and a "culture of toxic obfuscation."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those same dynamics are at play in Microsoft's recent
                    failures in policing the processes it put in place for
                    digitally certifying trustworthy Windows drivers. The
                    near-verbatim advisories mentioned earlier—one from

                    >
                    and the other from
                    <a
                      href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/ADV230001"
                      >last month</a
                    >—illustrate that whatever the company has been doing to
                    lock down the program isn't working. They also show how the
                    company relies on vague and ambiguous notifications that aim
                    to conceal as much as inform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft's driver-signing requirement is founded on a
                    concept known as security in depth. The idea is to have
                    multiple layers of security so that if one fails, another
                    will prevent a breach or at least contain the damage. In
                    this case, certificates are a hedge designed to lessen the
                    harm that comes when an adversary gains administrative
                    system rights to a compromised device.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Virtually all of the key-hijacking incidents reported in
                    recent years have been attributed to Chinese hackers,
                    usually for espionage purposes. Microsoft's string of
                    failures in locking down its certification program, and its
                    reticence when disclosing them, are undermining the entire
                    concept of security, much to the delight of these
                    adversaries.

                    by <em>Bloomberg</em>, the Starship launch left behind
                    devastating destruction to the local environment, as
                    reported by U.S. Wildlife officials following an
                    investigation of the site shortly after the launch. These
                    reports by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists were
                    obtained by the news outlet via a Freedom of Information Act
                    request.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wildlife officials note that upon surveying the scene after
                    Starship's launch, they found chunks of concrete across the
                    area and foot-deep craters on the tidal flats. The report
                    states that four acres of the nearby Texas state park were
                    burned. A group of blue land crabs and seven bobwhite quail
                    eggs were "incinerated" by the launch. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, the explosion from the launch "left a 385-acre
                    debris field that flung concrete chunks as far as 2,680 feet
                    from the launchpad and sparked a 3.5-acre fire."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Much of the damage was caused by a purposeful decision
                    from SpaceX that seemingly baffled experts in the documents.
                    SpaceX did not use flame-suppression technology like a flame
                    diverter or flame trench, a standard in the industry that
                    redirects energy away from the rocket ship. Without it,
                    Starship blew a hole in the ground underneath it,
                    subsequently destroying its launchpad.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The FAA is currently reviewing an investigation into the
                    launch and has temporarily grounded further attempts. But
                    one Wildlife official noted in the documents that it's
                    likely SpaceX won't be ready for another launch anytime
                    soon.
                  </p>

                    "Pad site was totally destroyed and will likely force them
                    to re-design the whole thing," the official wrote. "Probably
                    won't see another launch for a while."

                    Workplace burnout is widespread and has a detrimental effect
                    on employee performance, wellbeing, and the overall
                    productivity of the organisation. The literature contains
                    numerous studies exploring the causes and mechanisms of
                    workplace burnout; however, the role of personal
                    relationships in this context has not received sufficient
                    attention.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Burnout causes significant mental fatigue and manifests
                    through emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation (a state in
                    which individuals feel disconnected from their body,
                    thoughts, or emotions), and a decline in personal
                    fulfilment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The study findings indicate that as the level of
                    marital satisfaction increases, the risk of burnout
                    decreases, and this correlation is more pronounced in men.
                    The researchers attribute these findings to disparities in
                    social roles and stereotypes attributed to men and women,
                    along with variations in expectations related to marriage
                    and career.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When it comes to women, depersonalisation characterised by a
                    sense of detachment from colleagues and clients and a
                    decrease in empathy and compassion has a greater impact on
                    the development of burnout. For men, the most significant
                    factor is emotional fatigue from being overwhelmed with
                    requests and feeling incapable of effectively managing them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers suggest that depersonalisation experienced
                    by women is linked to the societal expectations and social
                    roles commonly imposed on them within the professional
                    realm. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings reveal that men who experience greater
                    professional success also tend to have higher levels of
                    satisfaction with their personal relationships. No such
                    correlation has been found for women. According to the
                    researchers, this suggests that support in one's personal
                    life may play a more significant role in facilitating
                    workplace success for men compared to women.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers emphasise that for organisations,
                    understanding the specific aspects of employee burnout can
                    serve as a valuable tool in managing stressful situations
                    and enhancing motivation.

                    In a groundbreaking endeavor, researchers at the University
                    of Rochester have successfully transferred a longevity gene
                    from naked mole rats to mice, resulting in improved health
                    and an extension of the mouse's lifespan.

                    Naked mole rats, known for their long lifespans and
                    exceptional resistance to age-related diseases, have long
                    captured the attention of the scientific community. By
                    introducing a specific gene responsible for enhanced
                    cellular repair and protection into mice, the Rochester
                    researchers have opened exciting possibilities for unlocking
                    the secrets of aging and extending human lifespan.

                  <p>
                    Night-time pollinators such as moths may visit just as many
                    plants as bees, and should also be the focus of conservation
                    and protection efforts, a new study from the University of
                    Sheffield suggests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study found that moths under pressure from urbanisation
                    may also be less resilient than bees, due to their more
                    complex life cycle and more specific plant requirements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It also revealed that despite this threat, moths play a
                    crucial role in supporting urban plant communities,
                    accounting for a third of all pollination in flowering
                    plants, crops and trees.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "As moths and bees both rely on plants for survival,
                    plant populations also rely on insects for pollination.
                    Protecting urban green spaces and ensuring they are
                    developed in such a way that moves beyond bee-only
                    conservation but also supports a diverse array of wildlife,
                    will ensure both bee and moth populations remain resilient
                    and our towns and cities remain healthier, greener places."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] [Study author Dr. E.E.] Ellis says the research
                    demonstrates just how crucial moths are at pollinating
                    plants, including crops, and that the study has implications
                    for wildlife-friendly gardening initiatives, urban planners
                    and policy makers responsible for developing urban green
                    spaces for parks or urban horticulture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She said: "People don't generally appreciate moths so they
                    can often be overlooked compared to bees when talking about
                    protection and conservation, but it's becoming apparent that
                    there needs to be a much more focused effort to raise
                    awareness of the important role moths play in establishing
                    healthy environments, especially as we know moth populations
                    have drastically declined over the past 50 years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When planning green spaces, consideration needs to be given
                    to ensure planting is diverse and moth-friendly as well as
                    bee-friendly, to ensure both our plants and insects remain
                    resilient in the face of the climate crisis and further
                    losses."

                    Japan's release of wastewater has sparked a wave of
                    misinformation in China about nuclear contamination in the
                    Pacific Ocean, with viral posts promoting wild theories that
                    lack scientific backing.

                    [...] In China, state-linked outlets have drawn links to the
                    fictional monster Godzilla, promoted a campy song decrying
                    Japan for polluting the Pacific and fish merchants were
                    pelted with comments doubting the safety of their products.

                    [...] "Of course [the discharge] should be opposed!"
                    prominent nationalist commentator Hu Xijin wrote on Weibo.
                    "It's polluting oceans and creating known long-term risks
                    that we don't quite understand."

                    Government officials have also weighed in, with Beijing's
                    Consul General in Belfast Zhang Meifang posting an animation
                    on social media platform X—which is banned in China—of
                    Godzilla surrounded by flames.

                    [...] And the false belief that iodized salt can protect
                    against radiation—as well as fears that sea salt from the
                    Pacific might be contaminated—has prompted panic buying of
                    the seasoning in China.

                    The VESPA payload adapter has been floating in Earth's orbit
                    following the launch of a Vega rocket in 2013, adding to the
                    thousands of pieces of space junk that currently surround
                    our planet. On August 10, the European Space Agency (ESA)
                    was informed by the United States 18th Space Defense
                    Squadron that new pieces of debris were spotted within the
                    vicinity of the VESPA adapter, suggesting that the object
                    broke up into smaller pieces due to a collision with another
                    piece of space debris.

                  <p>
                    After a decade in orbit as a useless piece of space junk,
                    VESPA was on the verge of serving a final purpose as the
                    target of ClearSpace-1—a claw-like spacecraft designed to
                    grab space junk and fling it into Earth's atmosphere to burn
                    up. The European mission is slated for launch in 2026, and
                    was meant to rendezvous with VESPA in order to test the new
                    junk removal technology in space.

                    But even if BA.2.86 does what Bloom sees as mostly
                    likely—fade away to an esoteric evolutionary anomaly—it
                    should still raise alarm over the current state of our virus
                    monitoring, as experts at the World Health Organization have
                    repeatedly warned about.

                  <p>
                    Part of the reason there is so little data on BA.2.86 is
                    that there is relatively little data on circulating variants
                    in general. In early 2022, at the height of pandemic genomic
                    surveillance, scientists worldwide submitted nearly 100,000
                    coronavirus genetic sequences per week to the public genomic
                    database (GISAID). In the past month, however,

                    In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                    has likewise seen a perilous drop in monitoring. In early
                    2022, the agency collected data from nearly 100,000 COVID-19
                    tests per week. Now, amid a summer wave with test positivity
                    on the rise again, the

                      href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklyhospitaladmissions_testpositivity_00"
                      >test volume is just 40,000</a
                    >. And the agency only has enough genomic surveillance data

                    [...] But things have only gotten worse since then. In
                    October 2022, for instance, scientists submitted over 20,000
                    coronavirus sequences per week to GISAID, compared with the
                    current average of around 5,000.

                    Paralysis had robbed the two women of their ability to
                    speak. For one, the cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
                    or ALS, a disease that affects the motor neurons. The other
                    had suffered a stroke in her brain stem. Though they can't
                    enunciate clearly, they remember how to formulate words.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, after volunteering to receive brain implants, both are
                    able to communicate through a computer at a speed
                    approaching the tempo of normal conversation. By parsing the
                    neural activity associated with the facial movements
                    involved in talking, the devices decode their intended
                    speech at a rate of 62 and 78 words per minute,
                    respectively—several times faster than the previous record.
                    Their cases are detailed in two papers published Wednesday
                    by separate teams in the journal Nature.

                    "It is now possible to imagine a future where we can restore

                    to freely say whatever they want to say with an accuracy
                    high enough to be understood reliably," said Frank Willett,

                    While slower than the roughly 160-word-per-minute rate of
                    natural conversation among English speakers, scientists say
                    it's an exciting step toward restoring real-time speech
                    using a brain-computer interface, or BCI.

                    In science fiction, "the ideal hero has a strong faith in
                    the Supreme Leader ideologically, so they don't get confused
                    with justice and truth," said Jang Hyuk, the math graduate
                    who defected a few years ago. "The value systems of North
                    Korea are quite different."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With the image of the Supreme Leaders looming large and the
                    propaganda machine pushing slogans like "we do whatever the
                    Party decides!" or "self-reliant prosperity," writing about
                    the future can be challenging. In some cases, imagining how
                    great North Korea could be might draw attention to its
                    current flaws.

                    "Science fiction is about anticipation, and this is a big
                    problem," said Antoine Coppola, a filmmaker who has studied
                    cinema in both North and South Korea. "Society is perfect in
                    North Korea; the hierarchy is perfect, so why dream about
                    the future? How to imagine the future when society is
                    perfect?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The contrast between the stories sci-fi literature tells and
                    the daily lives of the people has only become sharper.
                    "Since at least the 1990s, there has been not simply a gap
                    but an abyss between the rosy future depicted in North
                    Korean science fiction and the reality of life in North
                    Korea," Harvard historian of science Dong-Won Kim wrote in
                    one of his papers in 2018.<br />[...]<br />As North Korean
                    writers become more exposed to the West, the stories they
                    write are slowly changing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Recent sci-fi has that sort of sensationalism, the
                    suspense, the conspiracy motif, probably tied to the
                    increased availability of foreign media in the country,"
                    Berthelier said. "To me, it's revolutionary because there
                    isn't quite anything like that in the country's literary
                    history."

                    Resting-state functional MRI scans showed that slower
                    solvers had higher average functional connectivity, or
                    temporal synchrony, between their brain regions. In
                    personalized brain simulations of the 650 participants, the
                    researchers could determine that brains with reduced
                    functional connectivity literally "jump to conclusions" when
                    making decisions, rather than waiting until upstream brain
                    regions could complete the processing steps needed to solve
                    the problem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Synchronization, <em>i.e</em>., the formation of
                    functional networks in the brain, alters the properties of
                    working memory and thus the ability to 'endure' prolonged
                    periods without a decision," explains Michael Schirner, lead
                    author of the study and a scientist in Ritter's lab. "In
                    more challenging tasks, you have to store previous progress
                    in working memory while you explore other solution paths and
                    then integrate these into each other. This gathering of
                    evidence for a particular solution may sometimes takes
                    longer, but it also leads to better results. We were able to
                    use the model to show how excitation-inhibition balance at
                    the global level of the whole brain network affects
                    decision-making and working memory at the more granular
                    level of individual neural groups."

                    "Pixels are simply a means to measure the effectiveness of
                    College Board advertising," the spokesperson said. "If a
                    student uses the college search tool on CB.org, the student
                    can add a GPA and SAT score range to the search filters.
                    Those values are passed in the pixel, not because we
                    configured the pixel that way but because that's how the
                    pixel works."
                  </p>

                    [...] If you want to attain higher education in the United
                    States, the College Board is hard to avoid. The organization
                    writes and administers the SAT test and Advance Placement
                    (AP) exams, which students take to earn college credit and
                    bolster applications. The College Board also runs
                    standardized tests taken by children as young as
                    kindergartners, and essentially writes the curriculum in
                    some school districts.

                  <p>
                    The College Board, as powerful as a governmental institution
                    in some regards, is a non-profit. But that doesn't mean it
                    isn't profitable for the people who run it. According to tax
                    forms, 14 of the College Board's 17 executives made more
                    than $300,000 in 2021. Together, CEO David Coleman and
                    President Jeremy Singer made $1,782,254.

                    In the wake of the onslaught of the covid-19, employees
                    across the world grew chummy with a perfectly appropriate
                    remote work schedule that allows them to work from home.
                    However, one of the companies that carried pandemic digital
                    infrastructure on its back, Zoom, isn't too keen on keeping
                    remote workers away from the office since the video calling
                    platform is making them too friendly, according to leaked
                    audio of CEO Eric Yuan at an all-hands meeting at the
                    company.

                    on the recording in which Yuan told employees within 50
                    miles of an office that they must report to the office a
                    minimum of two days a week. The announcement came at a
                    companywide meeting on August 3, during which Yuan said that
                    it's difficult for Zoomies—the pet name the company gives to
                    employees—to build trust with each other on a computer
                    screen. Yuan also reportedly added that it's difficult to
                    have innovative conversations and debates on the company's
                    own platform because it makes people too friendly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Over the past several years, we've hired so many new
                    'Zoomies' that it's really hard to build trust," Yuan said
                    in the audio. "We cannot have a great conversation. We
                    cannot debate each other well because everyone tends to be
                    very friendly when you join a Zoom call."

                    A team of French and Japanese environmental scientists has
                    found that one kind of oil-eating microbe reshapes droplets
                    to optimize biodegradation. In their study, reported in the
                    journal Science, the group isolated Alcanivorax borkumensis
                    bacteria specimens in a lab setting, fed them crude oil, and
                    then watched how they worked together to eat the oil as
                    quickly and efficiently as possible.<br />...<br />In one
                    experiment, A. borkumensis samples that had not been exposed
                    to crude oil before were introduced to simple crude oil
                    droplets. Groups of the bacteria converged on a droplet,
                    forming a sphere. The sphere shape persisted until the
                    entire oil droplet had been consumed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But when the team exposed samples with experience consuming
                    crude oil, their behavior was much more advanced. Initially,
                    upon converging on a droplet, a sphere formed—but then
                    finger-like protrusions formed, radiating out from the
                    sphere, each completely covered with bacteria. The result
                    was much faster, more efficient consumption of the droplet.

                    A newly discovered zero-day in the widely used WinRAR
                    file-compression program has been exploited for four months
                    by unknown attackers who are using it to install malware
                    when targets open booby-trapped JPGs and other innocuous

                  <p>
                    The vulnerability, residing in the way WinRAR processes the
                    ZIP file format, has been under active exploit since April
                    in securities trading forums, researchers from security firm
                    Group IB
                    <a
                      href="https://www.group-ib.com/blog/cve-2023-38831-winrar-zero-day/"
                      >reported Wednesday</a
                    >. The attackers have been using the vulnerability to
                    remotely execute code that installs malware from families,
                    including DarkMe, GuLoader, and Remcos RAT.

                    number of victims infected is unknown, although Group-IB
                    said it has tracked at least 130 individuals known to have
                    been compromised. WinRAR developers fixed the vulnerability,
                    tracked as CVE-2023-38831, earlier this month.

                    [...] WinRAR has more than 500 million users who rely on the
                    program to compress large files to make them more manageable
                    and quicker to upload and download. It's not uncommon for
                    people to immediately decompress the resulting ZIP files
                    without inspecting them first. Even when people attempt to
                    examine them for malice, antivirus software often has
                    trouble peering into the compressed data to identify
                    malicious code.

                  <p>
                    The malicious ZIP archives Group-IB found were posted on
                    public forums used by traders to swap information and
                    discuss topics related to cryptocurrencies and other
                    securities. In most cases, the malicious ZIPs were attached
                    to forum posts. In other cases, they were distributed on the
                    file storage site catbox[.]moe. Group-IB identified eight
                    popular trading forums used to spread the files.

                    US government regulators reportedly tried to come to an
                    agreement with TikTok to prevent banning the app that would
                    have granted the federal government vast powers over the
                    app. That’s according to a draft of a deal between TikTok
                    and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States
                    (CFIUS)
                    <a
                      href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2023/08/21/draft-tiktok-cfius-agreement/?sh=1af8a03c112a"
                      >obtained by Forbes</a
                    >, a contract that would have given multiple US agencies
                    unprecedented access into the app’s records and operations.
                    Many of the concessions the government asked of TikTok look
                    eerily similar to the surveillance tactics critics have
                    accused Chinese officials of abusing. To allay fears the
                    short-form video app could be used as a Chinese surveillance
                    tool, the federal government nearly transformed it into an
                    American one instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Forbes reports that the draft agreement, dated Summer 2022,
                    would have given the US government agencies like the
                    Department of Justice and Department of Defense far more
                    access to TikTok’s operations than that of any other social
                    media company. The agreement would let agencies examine
                    TikTok’s US facilities, records, and servers with minimal
                    prior notice and veto the hiring of any executive involved
                    with leading TikTok US data security organization. It would
                    also let US agencies block changes to the app’s terms of
                    service in the US and order the company to subject itself to
                    various audits, all on TikTok’s dime, per Forbes. In extreme
                    cases, the agreement would allow government organizations to
                    demand TikTok temporarily shut off functioning in the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    CFIUS did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for
                    comment. TikTok would not confirm or deny the draft
                    agreement but instead sent us this statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “As has been widely reported, we’ve been working with CFIUS
                    for well over a year to implement a national security
                    agreement and have invested significant resources in
                    implementing a firewall to isolate U.S. user data,” a TikTok
                    spokesperson said. “Today, all new protected U.S. user data
                    is stored in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in the U.S.
                    with tightly controlled and monitored gateways. We are doing
                    more than any peer company to safeguard U.S. national
                    security interests.”

                    Have you ever been told that the company's data on laptops
                    is protected thanks to BitLocker? Well it turns out that
                    this depends on BitLocker's configuration...

                  <p>
                    The BitLocker partition is encrypted using the Full Volume
                    Encryption Key (FVEK). The FVEK itself is encrypted using
                    the Volume Master Key (VMK) and stored on the disk, next to
                    the encrypted data. This permits key rotations without
                    re-encrypting the whole disk.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The VMK is stored in the TPM. Thus the disk can only be
                    decrypted when booted from this computer (there is a
                    recovery mechanism in Active Directory though).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In order to decrypt the disk, the CPU will ask that the TPM
                    sends the VMK over the SPI bus.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The vulnerability should be obvious: at some point in the
                    boot process, the VMK transits unencrypted between the TPM
                    and the CPU. This means that it can be captured and used to
                    decrypt the disk.

                  <p>
                    Since the 17th century, when Isaac Newton and Christiaan
                    Huygens first debated the nature of light, scientists have
                    been puzzling over whether light is best viewed as a wave or
                    a particle—or perhaps, at the quantum level, even both at
                    once. Now, researchers at Stevens Institute of Technology
                    have revealed a new connection between the two perspectives,
                    using a 350-year-old mechanical theorem—ordinarily used to
                    describe the movement of large, physical objects like
                    pendulums and planets—to explain some of the most complex
                    behaviors of light waves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The work, led by Xiaofeng Qian, assistant professor of
                    physics at Stevens and reported in the August 17 online
                    issue of Physical Review Research, also proves for the first
                    time that a light wave's degree of non-quantum entanglement
                    exists in a direct and complementary relationship with its
                    degree of polarization. As one rises, the other falls,
                    enabling the level of entanglement to be inferred directly
                    from the level of polarization, and vice versa. This means
                    that hard-to-measure
                    <a href="https://phys.org/tags/optical+properties/"
                      >optical properties</a
                    >
                    such as amplitudes, phases and correlations—perhaps even
                    these of quantum wave systems—can be deduced from something
                    a lot easier to measure:
                    <a href="https://phys.org/tags/light+intensity/"
                      >light intensity</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We've known for over a century that light sometimes behaves
                    like a wave, and sometimes like a particle, but reconciling
                    those two frameworks has proven extremely difficult," said
                    Qian "Our work doesn't solve that problem—but it does show
                    that there are profound connections between wave and
                    particle concepts not just at the
                    <a href="https://phys.org/tags/quantum+level/"
                      >quantum level</a
                    >, but at the level of classical light-waves and point-mass
                    systems."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Qian's team used a mechanical theorem, originally developed
                    by Huygens in a 1673 book on pendulums, that explains how
                    the energy required to rotate an object varies depending on
                    the object's mass and the axis around which it turns. "This
                    is a well-established mechanical theorem that explains the
                    workings of physical systems like clocks or
                    <a href="https://phys.org/tags/prosthetic+limbs/"
                      >prosthetic limbs</a
                    >," Qian explained. "But we were able to show that it can
                    offer new insights into how light works, too."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Essentially, we found a way to translate an optical
                    system so we could visualize it as a mechanical system, then
                    describe it using well-established physical equations,"
                    explained Qian.

                in Oslo, Norway at Kulturkirken Jakob (St. James Church of
                Culture) where the actor and film director Liv Ullmann read the

                journalist who has worked for many years at the
                <i>New York Times</i>, NPR, and several other publications. In
                his sermon he expounds on the long-standing problem of speaking
                truth to power.

                    Julian exposed the truth. He exposed it over and over and
                    over until there was no question of the endemic illegality,
                    corruption and mendacity that defines the global ruling
                    class And for these truths they came after Julian, as they
                    have come after all who dared rip back the veil on power.
                    "Red Rosa now has vanished too," Bertolt Brecht wrote after
                    the German socialist Rosa Luxemburg was murdered. "She told
                    the poor what life is about, And so the rich have rubbed her

                    war, financial speculation and internal surveillance are the
                    only real business of the state, where even habeas corpus no
                    longer exists, where we, as citizens, are nothing more than
                    commodities to corporate systems of power, ones to be used,

                Given the massive quantities of disinformation spread over a
                longer period of time against Julian Assange, and the media
                blackout on coverage of his case and how it effects journalism
                as a whole, this is a difficult case to find a concise and
                accurate summary to link to. The bottom line is that, regardless
                of what one thinks (or has been told to think) about Julian
                Assange, the case hinges on factors which will determine whether
                or not there is a future for investigative reporting.

                    suggesting hell has frozen over. In a letter dated August
                    22, Apple showed its support for California's

                    [...] The bill has been praised by right-to-repair activists
                    like iFixit, who says the bill goes further than
                    right-to-repair laws passed in

                      >New York</a

                    right-to-repair legislation yet. Some activists, though,
                    lamented that companies aren't required to sell parts and
                    tools for devices not actively sold. California's bill,
                    however, keeps vendors on the hook for three years after the
                    last date of manufacture if the product is $50 to $99.99 and
                    seven years if it's over $99.99.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The bill also allows a city, county, or state to bring a
                    related case to superior court rather than only a state
                    attorney general, as noted by iFixit's

                    difficult to spot, more capable of duping users, and more
                    effective at gaming the algorithms used to prioritize
                    content on social media.

                    "It tricks both the platform and the users," Menczer says of
                    the ChatGPT-powered botnet. And, if a social media algorithm
                    spots that a post has a lot of engagement—even if that
                    engagement is from other bot accounts—it will show the post
                    to more people. "That's exactly why these bots are behaving
                    the way they do," Menczer says. And governments looking to
                    wage disinformation campaigns are most likely already
                    developing or deploying such tools, he adds.

                    Menczer says that malicious bots appear to have become far
                    more common since Elon Musk took over what was then known as
                    Twitter, despite the tech mogul's promise

                    Someone at X apparently took down the Fox8 botnet after
                    Menczer and Yang published their paper in July. Menczer's
                    group used to alert Twitter of new findings on the platform,
                    but they no longer do that with X. "They are not really
                    responsive," Menczer says. "They don't really have the

                    and it has never been," the document states, citing outcomes
                    of the World Summit of the Information Society (WSIS) – a UN
                    event staged in 2003 and 2005 that defined a
                    multi-stakeholder internet governance framework. 2015's

                    community as a distinct stakeholder – have worked.

                    continue to play its critical roles in the future of the
                    internet, and it behooves the UN to recognize this reality

                    A prototype satellite built to test a deployable drag sail
                    to de-orbit satellites appears to have fulfilled its
                    purpose, burning up on re-entry earlier this month after
                    spending just 445 days in orbit.

                    SBUDNIC, an acronym chosen to be a play on "Sputnik," was
                    put together by students at Brown University, Rhode Island,
                    using low-cost off-the-shelf commercial components. The
                    CubeSat design featured a drag sail made from Kapton
                    polyimide film, and with structural supports of thin
                    aluminum tubing, which deployed once the satellite was in
                    orbit.

                    in this respect, according to tracking data the team
                    obtained from US Space Command. It indicated that SBUDNIC
                    was about 470 kilometers (292 miles) above the Earth in
                    early March, while other comparably sized satellites
                    deployed to a similar orbit as part of the same mission were
                    still at altitudes of 500 kilometers (310 miles) or more.

                    [...] Previous predictions had suggested that the drag
                    device would reduce the orbital lifetime of SBUDNIC from
                    over 20 years to as few as 6.5 years, but in reality it was

                    around a $10 Arduino system plus 65 AA lithium batteries and
                    included a variety of 3D-printed parts produced with

                    Four nonprofit groups seeking to protect kids' privacy
                    online asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to
                    investigate YouTube today, after back-to-back reports
                    allegedly showed that YouTube is still targeting
                    personalized ads on videos "made for kids."

                  <p>
                    Now it has become urgent that the FTC probe YouTube's data

                    said, and potentially intervene. Otherwise, it's possible
                    that YouTube could continue to allegedly harvest data on
                    millions of kids, seemingly in violation of the Children's
                    Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the FTC Act.

                    alleging YouTube's noncompliance with federal laws came last
                    week from Adalytics and was quickly corroborated by research
                    from Fairplay, one of the groups behind the FTC letter,

                    really blocking all personalized ads from appearing in
                    children's channels, as YouTube said it was. Both found that
                    "Google and YouTube permit and report on behavioral ad

                    But in their letter, child advocates told FTC Chair Lina
                    Khan that they have "serious questions" about whether Google
                    is being honest about ad targeting. After running targeted
                    ad campaigns, Fairplay reported that YouTube placed its
                    behavioral ads on children's channels 1,446 times. If
                    YouTube was operating in compliance with COPPA as it
                    claimed, Fairplay said that these campaigns would have
                    resulted in zero ad placements.

                    Roughly a century before the Inca empire came to power in
                    A.D. 1400, blasts of human-produced thunder may have rumbled
                    off a ridge high in the Andes Mountains.

                    New evidence indicates that people who lived there around
                    700 years ago stomped rhythmically on a special dance floor
                    that amplified their pounding into a thunderous boom as they
                    worshipped a thunder god.

                    Excavations at a high-altitude site in Peru called Viejo
                    Sangayaico have revealed how members of a regional farming
                    and herding group, the Chocorvos, constructed this
                    reverberating platform, says archaeologist Kevin Lane of the
                    University of Buenos Aires. Different layers of soil, ash
                    and guano created a floor that absorbed shocks while
                    emitting resonant sounds when people stomped on it. This

                    feet, Lane reports in the September

                    [...] His team acoustically tested the platform by stomping
                    on it one at a time and in groups of two to four while
                    measuring the noise produced. The same was done while a
                    circle of four people stomp-danced across the platform.

                    The resulting sounds ranged in intensity from 60 to 80
                    decibels, roughly equivalent to between a loud conversation
                    and a noisy restaurant, Lane says. Larger groups of
                    Chocorvos dancers, possibly accompanied by singing and
                    musical instruments, would have raised a much bigger racket.

                    material. Eibon went a step further, eating one without
                    suffering any ill effects, but he isn't touting that lest
                    p-Chip face accusations it is tracking people, something
                    that isn't possible because the chips can't be read remotely
                    and can't be read once they are ingested.

                    nobody is tracking me, except my wife, and she uses a
                    different method."

                Ötzi the Iceman is one of the most well-studied individuals in
                human history, but there always seems to be more to learn about
                him. A new genomic study has now found that he didn't look the
                way previous studies had imagined him – instead he was bald, his
                skin was darker, and he had an ancestry that was far more exotic
                and isolated than previously thought.
              </p>
              <p>
                In September 1991, two hikers discovered a human body in the
                Alps near the Austria and Italy border. At first they assumed
                they'd stumbled on an unlucky modern mountaineer, but on closer,
                scientific investigation, it was determined that the chap had
                died about 5,300 years ago. In the three decades since his
                discovery, Ötzi has been studied extensively, with scientists
                able to figure out what he ate, how he dressed, how he lived and
                how he died.
              </p>
              <p>
                His full genome was published in 2012, allowing scientists to
                reconstruct an image of what he might have looked like. From
                that data, Ötzi was imagined as a fairly light-skinned man with
                a bushy beard, a thick head of unkempt hair, deep-set eyes and
                wrinkled skin beyond his 45 years of life. But a new study,
                using more comprehensive genomic analysis techniques, upends
                much of that picture.
