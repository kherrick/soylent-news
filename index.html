                <div>
                  <p>
                    Two insect-like robots, a mini-bug and a water strider,
                    developed at Washington State University, are the smallest,
                    lightest and fastest fully functional micro-robots ever
                    known to be created.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such miniature robots could someday be used for work in
                    areas such as artificial pollination, search and rescue,
                    environmental monitoring, micro-fabrication or
                    robotic-assisted surgery. Reporting on their work in the
                    proceedings of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society's
                    International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems,
                    the mini-bug weighs in at eight milligrams while the water
                    strider weighs 55 milligrams. Both can move at about six
                    millimeters a second.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That is fast compared to other micro-robots at this scale,
                    although it still lags behind their biological relatives,"
                    said Conor Trygstad, a Ph.D. student in the School of
                    Mechanical and Materials Engineering and lead author on the
                    work. An ant typically weighs up to five milligrams and can
                    move at almost a meter per second.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The key to the tiny robots is their tiny actuators that make
                    the robots move. Trygstad used a new fabrication technique
                    to miniaturize the actuator down to less than a milligram,
                    the smallest ever known to have been made.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The actuators are the smallest and fastest ever developed
                    for micro-robotics," said Néstor O. Pérez-Arancibia,
                    Flaherty Associate Professor in Engineering at WSU's School
                    of Mechanical and Materials Engineering who led the project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The actuator uses a material called a shape memory alloy
                    that is able to change shapes when it's heated. It is called
                    'shape memory' because it remembers and then returns to its
                    original shape. Unlike a typical motor that would move a
                    robot, these alloys don't have any moving parts or spinning
                    components.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "They're very mechanically sound," said Trygstad. "The
                    development of the very lightweight actuator opens up new
                    realms in micro-robotics."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shape memory alloys are not generally used for large-scale
                    robotic movement because they are too slow. In the case of
                    the WSU robots, however, the actuators are made of two tiny
                    shape memory alloy wires that are 1/1000 of an inch in
                    diameter. With a small amount of current, the wires can be
                    heated up and cooled easily, allowing the robots to flap
                    their fins or move their feet at up to 40 times per second.
                    In preliminary tests, the actuator was also able to lift
                    more than 150 times its own weight.

                    [...] why did the left hand (LH) mid-exit door plug blow off
                    of the 737-9 registered as N704AL? Simple- as has been
                    covered in a number of articles and videos across aviation
                    channels, there are 4 bolts that prevent the mid-exit door
                    plug from sliding up off of the door stop fittings that take
                    the actual pressurization loads in flight, and these 4 bolts
                    were not installed when Boeing delivered the airplane, our
                    own records reflect this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result, this check job that should find minimal defects
                    has in the past 365 calendar days recorded 392 nonconforming
                    findings on 737 mid fuselage door installations (so both
                    actual doors for the high density configs, and plugs like
                    the one that blew out). That is a hideously high and very
                    alarming number, and if our quality system on 737 was
                    healthy, it would have stopped the line and driven the issue
                    back to supplier after the first few instances.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The mid-exit doors on a 737-9 of both the regular and plug
                    variety come from Spirit already installed in what is
                    supposed to be the final configuration and in the Renton
                    factory, there is a job for the doors team to verify this
                    "final" install and rigging meets drawing requirements. In a
                    healthy production system, this would be a "belt and
                    suspenders" sort of check, but the 737 production system is
                    quite far from healthy, its a rambling, shambling, disaster
                    waiting to happen. As a result, this check job that should
                    find minimal defects has in the past 365 calendar days
                    recorded 392 nonconforming findings on 737 mid fuselage door
                    installations (so both actual doors for the high density
                    configs, and plugs like the one that blew out). That is a
                    hideously high and very alarming number, and if our quality
                    system on 737 was healthy, it would have stopped the line
                    and driven the issue back to supplier after the first few
                    instances. Obviously, this did not happen. Now, on the
                    incident aircraft this check job was completed on 31 August
                    2023, and did turn up discrepancies, but on the RH side
                    door, not the LH that actually failed. I could blame the
                    team for missing certain details, but given the enormous
                    volume of defects they were already finding and fixing, it
                    was inevitable something would slip through- and on the
                    incident aircraft something did. I know what you are
                    thinking at this point, but grab some popcorn because there
                    is a plot twist coming up. [....]

                    We conduct the first large-scale user study examining how
                    users interact with an AI Code assistant to solve a variety
                    of security related tasks across different programming
                    languages. Overall, we find that participants who had access
                    to an AI assistant based on OpenAI's codex-davinci-002 model
                    wrote significantly less secure code than those without
                    access. Additionally, participants with access to an AI
                    assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code
                    than those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore,
                    we find that participants who trusted the AI less and
                    engaged more with the language and format of their prompts
                    (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with
                    fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better
                    inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we
                    provide an in-depth analysis of participants' language and
                    interaction behavior, as well as release our user interface
                    as an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future.

                    The skeleton of a young adult female—age was determined
                    based on the wear of the teeth—found at the Charterhouse
                    Warren site in Somerset—was dated back to the Early Iron
                    Age. The genetic analysis showed that some cells had one X
                    chromosome and others had the usual two, known as mosaic
                    Turner syndrome. Women with Turner syndrome generally
                    undergo human growth hormone and estrogen replacement
                    therapy to boost height and trigger the onset of puberty,
                    respectively. The remains included a partial skull, which
                    showed marked pitting in the orbits—evidence of chronic
                    intestinal hemorrhage, often the result of anemia, although
                    there is a possible link with Turner syndrome. Osteological
                    analysis revealed evidence of delayed growth, and the woman
                    was unlikely to have gone through puberty and started
                    menstruating.

                    The male infant had an extra chromosome 21 (a sign of Down
                    syndrome) and was found at the Wetwang Slack site, buried in
                    the ditch of a square barrow along with an adult female,
                    although the two were not necessarily related since infants
                    were often buried in existing burrows, per the authors. The
                    skeleton with an extra Y chromosome also showed osteological
                    evidence consistent with Jacobs syndrome (male, 46+ years,
                    dated 680 to 890 CE); it was found at the Lincoln Eastern
                    Bypass site in Lincolnshire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The three skeletons that showed evidence of Klinefelter
                    syndrome were all buried during different periods according
                    to the burial customs of their day. One skeleton (male,
                    17–19 years, circa 450 BCE) was found at an Iron Age
                    cemetery site called Wetwang Slack in Yorkshire; another
                    (male, 36–45, 12th–13th century) came from a medieval
                    cemetery under Longwall Quad at Magdalen College, Oxford;
                    and yet another (16–19 years, 18th–19th century) was found
                    at Trinity Burial Ground in Kingston upon Hull. All three
                    skeletons showed signs of delayed puberty and were slightly
                    taller than average for their time, consistent with the
                    genetic evidence showing extra X chromosomes.

                    Vard Group is part of NuProShip, a consortium of the
                    Norwegian maritime authority, universities, shipbuilders,
                    and shipping companies that aims to develop a Generation IV
                    reactor for marine vessels. The group has shortlisted three
                    designs and plan to have picked one by the end of 2024.<br />...<br />
                      Now, the immense scale of shipping's decarbonization
                    challenge, along with new reactor technologies, are
                    prompting a reevaluation of nuclear merchant ships. In fact,
                    for commercial shippers, there aren't any realistic
                    alternatives to nuclear, says Jan Emblemsvåg, professor of
                    ocean operations and civil engineering at the Norwegian
                    University of Science and Technology. "Engines in ordinary
                    ships are the size of houses," says Emblemsvåg, who is
                    leading NuProShip. And a great deal of space is taken up by
                    fuel: "A container vessel going from Amsterdam to Shanghai
                    requires roughly 4,000 tonnes of fuel."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An SMR would be much more compact and lightweight. According
                    to Emblemsvåg, a molten-salt reactor—which uses a mixture of
                    thorium and hot liquid salts as both fuel and coolant—would
                    also save about $70 million over the lifetime of a ship,
                    compared with a similar vessel powered by engines that burn
                    diesel fuel (or, more precisely, heavy fuel oil). Another
                    plus for nuclear-propelled ships is easy access to an
                    endless supply of cooling water.

                    The Los Angeles Times in 2018 for $500 million. Marc
                    Benioff, the founder of the software giant Salesforce,

                    [...] But it increasingly looks like the billionaires are
                    struggling just like nearly everyone else. Time, The
                    Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times all lost millions
                    of dollars last year, people with knowledge of the
                    companies' finances have said, after considerable investment
                    from their owners and intensive efforts to drum up new
                    revenue streams.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the middle of last year, The Times was on track to
                    lose $30 million to $40 million in 2023, according to three
                    people with knowledge of the projections. Last year, the
                    company cut about 74 jobs, and executives have met in recent
                    days to discuss the possibility of deep job cuts, according
                    to two other people familiar with the conversations. Members
                    of The Los Angeles Times union have called an emergency
                    meeting for Thursday to discuss the possibility of another
                    "major" round of layoffs: "This is the big one," read the

                    [...] Mr. Bezos hasn't fared much better at The Washington
                    Post. Like many news organizations, The Post has struggled
                    to hold onto the momentum it gained in the wake of the 2020
                    election. Sagging subscriptions and advertising revenue led
                    to losses of about $100 million last year. At the end of the
                    year, the company eliminated 240 of its 2,500 jobs through
                    buyouts, including some of its well-regarded journalists.

                    [...] Time is facing similar headwinds. The publication lost
                    around $20 million in 2023, according to two people with
                    knowledge of the publication's financial picture. Time has
                    weighed cutting costs in the first quarter of the year to
                    help offset some of the losses, one of the people said.

                        It turns out that designing for usability, efficiency,

                    with the approaching end-of-life (EOL) of CentOS Stream 8,
                    enterprises may face critical challenges in securing their
                    Linux environment. This analysis provides insights into the
                    potential consequences of CentOS Stream 8 EOL, discusses
                    mitigation strategies, and examines the importance of
                    maintaining security in enterprise environments.

                    CentOS Stream 8, released alongside CentOS 8, has become a
                    stable and reliable platform for many enterprise users.
                    However, with the end of support for CentOS 8, users have
                    migrated to CentOS Stream as a viable alternative.
                    Unfortunately, CentOS Stream 8 will also reach its EOL on
                    May 31, 2024. This poses significant challenges in the areas
                    of security, support, and

                    The implications and long-term consequences of using CentOS
                    Stream 8 beyond its EOL could be severe. One of the key
                    implications is the lack of security updates, leaving
                    enterprise systems vulnerable to potential threats. The
                    absence of official support further intensifies the risk of
                    compatibility issues and increased downtime. This raises
                    important questions: How can enterprises protect their
                    systems from cyber threats without security updates? How can
                    they ensure compliance and data security without official
                    support?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Luckily, mitigation strategies exist for CentOS Stream 8
                    EOL, including migration to other long-term supported
                    operating systems such as CentOS Stream 9, AlmaLinux, Oracle
                    Linux, RHEL, or Rocky Linux. However, a careful and
                    strategic planning process is essential to minimize
                    disruptions during the migration process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These challenges ultimately call for careful planning,
                    strategic decision-making, and a proactive approach to
                    maintaining security in enterprise environments. It is
                    crucial for security practitioners to assess the specific
                    needs of their organizations and determine the most suitable
                    path forward to ensure ongoing data security and compliance.

                    Researchers have linked the travels of a 14,000-year-old
                    wooly mammoth with the oldest known human settlements in
                    Alaska, providing clues about the relationship between the
                    iconic species and some of the earliest people to travel
                    across the Bering Land Bridge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists made those connections by using isotope analysis
                    to study the life of a female mammoth, named Élmayųujey'eh,
                    by the Healy Lake Village Council. A tusk from Elma was
                    discovered at the Swan Point archaeological site in Interior
                    Alaska. Samples from the tusk revealed details about Elma
                    and the roughly 1,000-kilometer journey she took through
                    Alaska and northwestern Canada during her lifetime.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Isotopic data, along with DNA from other mammoths at the
                    site and archaeological evidence, indicates that early
                    Alaskans likely structured their settlements to overlap with
                    areas where mammoths congregated. Those findings,
                    highlighted in the journal Science Advances, provide
                    evidence that mammoths and early hunter-gatherers shared
                    habitat in the region. The long-term predictable presence of
                    wooly mammoths would have attracted humans to the area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "She wandered around the densest region of archaeological
                    sites in Alaska," said Audrey Rowe, a University of Alaska
                    Fairbanks Ph.D. student and lead author of the paper. "It
                    looks like these early people were establishing hunting
                    camps in areas that were frequented by mammoths."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The mammoth tusk was excavated and identified in 2009 by
                    Charles Holmes, affiliate research professor of anthropology
                    at UAF, and François Lanoë, research associate in
                    archaeology at the University of Alaska Museum of the North.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found Elma's tusk and the remains of two related
                    juvenile mammoths, along with evidence of campfires, the use
                    of stone tools, and butchered remains of other game. All of
                    this "indicates a pattern consistent with human hunting of
                    mammoths," said Ben Potter, an archaeologist and professor
                    of anthropology at UAF.

                    One evening in June 2023, Nicholas Wise, a fluid dynamics
                    researcher / scientific fraud buster, was digging around on
                    shady Facebook groups where he found someone calling
                    themselves Jack Ben, of a firm whose Chinese name translates
                    to Olive Academic, offering journal editors large sums of
                    cash in return for accepting papers for publication...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] At least tens of millions of dollars flow to the paper
                    mill industry each year, estimates Matt Hodgkinson of the
                    independent charity UK Research Integrity Office, which
                    offers support to further good research practices, who is
                    also a council member at the nonprofit Committee on
                    Publication Ethics. Publishers and journals, recognizing the
                    threat, have beefed up their research integrity teams and
                    retracted papers, sometimes by the hundreds. They are
                    investing in ways to better spot third-party involvement,
                    such as screening tools meant to flag bogus papers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So cash-rich paper mills have evidently adopted a new
                    tactic: bribing editors and planting their own agents on
                    editorial boards to ensure publication of their manuscripts.
                    An investigation by Science and Retraction Watch, in
                    partnership with Wise and other industry experts, identified
                    several paper mills and more than 30 editors of reputable
                    journals who appear to be involved in this type of activity.
                    Many were guest editors of special issues, which have been
                    flagged in the past as particularly vulnerable to abuse
                    because they are edited separately from the regular journal.
                    But several were regular editors or members of journal
                    editorial boards. And this is likely just the tip of the
                    iceberg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hodgkinson recalls hearing one publisher say it "had to sack
                    300 editors for manipulative behavior." He adds, "These are
                    organized crime rings that are committing large-scale
                    fraud."

                    in use at their workplace. But a significant minority of
                    developers say their company has no interest in generative
                    AI tools or has outright banned their use.

                    >, released Thursday, aggregates the thoughts of over 3,000
                    industry professionals as of last October. While the annual
                    survey (conducted in conjunction with research partner
                    Omdia) has been running for 12 years, this is the first time
                    respondents were asked directly about their use of
                    generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, GitHub Copilot,
                    and Adobe Generative Fill.

                    Forty-nine percent of the survey's developer respondents
                    said that generative AI tools are currently being used in
                    their workplace.<br />[...]<br />The wide embrace of AI
                    tools hasn't seemed to lessen worries about their use among
                    developers, though. A full 42 percent of respondents said
                    they were "very concerned" about the ethics of using
                    generative AI in game development, with an additional 42
                    percent being "somewhat concerned." Only 12 percent said
                    they were "not concerned at all" about those usage ethics.

                    processor manufacturer TSMC has announced that it expects

                    that the all Arizona-made chips would still go to Taiwan for

                  <p>
                    According to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, TSMC chair
                    Mark Liu

                    that construction continues, but it will not be mass

                    expects it to be fully operational by 2027 or 2028, though
                    it gave no specific reasons for the delay.

                  <p>
                    Liu also said that the new factory may not be dedicated to
                    3nm production. He said that the specific chip type had yet
                    to be determined, and that the choice would be affected both
                    by customer demand and government incentives.

                  <p>
                    The reference to initiatives is not the only factor in
                    TSMC's relationship with the US government. As TSMC is a
                    Taiwanese company and the US does not have an income tax
                    agreement with that country, the chip manufacturer faces
                    double taxation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unless this changes, it's been reported that TSMC would

                    Machine tools – machines that cut or form metal – are the
                    heart of industrial civilization. Sometimes called "mother
                    machines" (because they're machines that make other
                    machines), machine tools are required to make almost
                    everything. Nearly every manufactured good is made using
                    machine tools, or by machines which were made using machine
                    tools:

                    Being able to manufacture machine tools is often considered
                    an important capability for an industrialized country. Not
                    only does this provide ready access to the latest
                    manufacturing technology, but it ensures production of
                    munitions and other military equipment won't be bottlenecked
                    by a lack of machine tools. This isn't a hypothetical
                    concern: American production of artillery shells for Ukraine
                    has been held back by a lack of machine tools. The military
                    has thus historically paid close attention to the machine
                    tool industry and the availability of machinists.

                    For most of the 20th century, the US was unrivaled in its
                    machine tool technology, and as late as the early 1980s it
                    was the largest machine tool producer in the world.. But
                    almost overnight, the industry collapsed: annual machine
                    tool shipments declined by more than 50% in 2 years,
                    hundreds of machine tool companies went out of business, and
                    the US slipped from the largest producer in the world to the
                    4th or 5th (depending on the year), roughly where it remains
                    today.

                    landing was successful, with the livestream ending
                    inconclusively. A wait of more than an hour followed for

                    appeared to show signals from both SLIM and the Lunar
                    Excursion Vehicle 1 (LEV-1)—a small rover accompanying SLIM
                    and ejected onto the surface at an altitude of two
                    meters—being received in Madrid. Amateur tracking stations
                    meanwhile reported signals from both SLIM and LEV-1.

                    JAXA confirmed landing success during a press conference
                    just under two hours after the landing occurred. However the
                    spacecraft's solar cells were not generating electricity.
                    The reason for the solar cell issue was not immediately
                    known, but spacecraft orientation—suggesting the lander may
                    have rolled—is consider a possibility. SLIM is currently
                    working on battery power.

                    "We believe that the soft landing itself was successful," a
                    JAXA official said, stating that the spacecraft had survived
                    the landing and was sending data.

                    Teams are working to maximize data gathering and science
                    output. LEV-1 and another rover, LEV-2, were also confirmed
                    to have separated successfully and operating. JAXA will said
                    it will hold another press conference in the following week.

                    Five crushable, 3D-printed aluminum lattice landing legs
                    helped the lander absorb the impact of touchdown on the
                    lunar surface.

                    The mission was primarily aiming to demonstrate precise
                    landing technology, allowing the spacecraft to set down
                    within 100 meters of a target point. SLIM was targeting a
                    landing on the sloped rim inside the 300-meters-wide Shioli
                    crater.

                    While the landing was confirmed successful, it will take up
                    to a month to confirm the success or failure of the
                    "pinpoint" landing. The accuracy will be assessed with
                    observations from lunar orbit.

                    While sutures and staples suffice for closing most wounds,
                    they can damage delicate tissue, plus they may allow fluids
                    to leak out when applied to internal organs. Scientists have
                    thus set about improving an alternative wound-closure method
                    known as tissue soldering.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Putting it simply, tissue soldering is an experimental
                    technique in which a gelatinous paste is applied to the
                    pressed-together edges of a wound, then heated with a laser.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The heat causes the paste to polymerize and bond with the
                    collagen in the underlying tissue, forming a flexible
                    watertight seal which holds the wound closed until it heals.
                    Not only is the process typically faster yet gentler than
                    applying sutures or staples, it also produces less
                    inflammation, less scarring, and provides better protection
                    against infections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That said, complications may occur if the paste isn't heated
                    to just the right temperature. If it's too cold, it won't
                    bond with the tissue properly, whereas if it's too hot, it
                    will burn the tissue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an effort to address that problem, scientists from
                    Switzerland's Empa and ETH Zurich research institutes have
                    developed an albumin-based paste called iSolder (intelligent
                    solder). It contains titanium nitride and bismuth vanadate
                    nanoparticles – the former convert laser light into heat,
                    whereas the latter fluoresce when heated to a precise
                    temperature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, when a gelatinous sheet of the iSolder is applied to a
                    wound and then exposed to laser light, it will visibly glow
                    upon reaching the just-right temperature at which it bonds
                    with the underlying tissue. This takes the guesswork out of
                    tissue welding – surgeons just keep applying the laser light
                    until the paste glows, then stop when it does.

                    Microsoft didn't detect the breach until January 12, exactly
                    a week before Friday's disclosure. Microsoft's account
                    raises the prospect that the Russian hackers had
                    uninterrupted access to the accounts for as long as two
                    months.

                    Microsoft's network was protected by a weak password with no
                    form of two-factor authentication employed. The Russian
                    adversary group was able to guess it by peppering it with
                    previously compromised or commonly used passwords until they
                    finally landed on the right one. The threat actor then
                    accessed the account, indicating that either 2FA wasn't
                    employed or the protection was somehow bypassed.

                    Furthermore, this "legacy non-production test tenant

                        A lot of fascinating implications here. A successful
                        password spray attack suggests no 2FA and either reused
                        or weak passwords. Access to email accounts belonging to
                        "senior leadership... cybersecurity, and legal" teams
                        using just the permissions of a "test tenant account"
                        suggests that someone gave that test account amazing
                        privileges. Why? Why wasn't it removed when the test was
                        over? I also note that it took Microsoft about seven
                        weeks to detect the attack.

                    fabled magazine published AI-generated content — admitted to
                    failing to make a $3.75 million quarterly licensing payment

                    As a result, the publicly-traded Arena announced Thursday it
                    would make a "significant reduction" in its workforce of
                    more than 100 journalists.

                    From a period of time between February 2023 and July 25th,
                    2023, one such repository was GitHub's own
                    actions/runner-images repository. You might be able to guess
                    where this story this is going. This is the story of how I
                    discovered and exploited a Critical misconfiguration
                    vulnerability and reported it to GitHub. The vulnerability
                    provided access to internal GitHub infrastructure as well as
                    secrets. There was also a very high likelihood that this
                    access could be used to insert malicious code into all of
                    GitHub's runner base images – allowing an attacker to
                    conduct a supply chain attack against every GitHub customer
                    that used hosted runners.

                    It will come as no surprise to US government watchers that
                    there's next to no federal regulation governing the
                    appropriate use of facial recognition technology - a fact
                    that the report takes pains to spell out as a serious
                    problem. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Facial recognition technology has the potential to impact
                    civil liberties, human rights, and privacy in meaningful
                    ways, because it changes the scale and cost of collecting
                    detailed data about a person's every move," said Edward
                    Felten, another co-chair of the committee behind the report.
                    "The number of uses will continue to expand as the
                    technology becomes more widespread and inexpensive."

                    <a

                    shows more than half of US states have already purchased
                    their own face recognition systems and allowed federal
                    agencies to have access.

                  <p>
                    In other words, it's already here, and it's pretty
                    widespread.

                  <p>
                    As for the White House, whether President Biden will issue
                    an executive order addressing the NASEM report's
                    recommendations is unknown - we asked, but didn't hear back.
                    Then again, even if Biden takes action there's nothing to
                    stop another administration from simply undoing his
                    executive order and pursuing a different agenda. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not to be pessimistic, but the likelihood the US federal
                    government passes comprehensive regulations on the use of
                    facial recognition seems infinitesimally low, even if the
                    FBI and DHS are being told by their own sponsored report
                    that it needs to happen as soon as possible.

                    The unique underwater kelp forests that line the Pacific
                    Coast support a varied ecosystem that was thought to have
                    evolved along with the kelp over the past 14 million years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But a new study shows that kelp flourished off the Northwest
                    Coast more than 32 million years ago, long before the
                    appearance of modern groups of marine mammals, sea urchins,
                    birds and bivalves that today call the forests home.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The much greater age of these coastal kelp forests, which
                    today are a rich ecosystem supporting otters, sea lions,
                    seals, and many birds, fish and crustaceans, means that they
                    likely were a main source of food for an ancient,
                    now-extinct mammal called a desmostylian. The
                    hippopotamus-sized grazer is thought to be related to
                    today's sea cows, manatees and their terrestrial relatives,
                    the elephants.

                    "People initially said, "We don't think the kelps were there
                    before 14 million years ago because the organisms associated
                    with the modern kelp forest were not there yet,'" said
                    paleobotanist Cindy Looy, professor of integrative biology
                    at the University of California, Berkeley. "Now, we show the
                    kelps were there, it's just that all the organisms that you
                    expect to be associated with them were not. Which is not
                    that strange, because you first need the foundation for the
                    whole system before everything else can show up."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Evidence for the greater antiquity of kelp forests, reported
                    this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy
                    of Sciences, comes from newly discovered fossils of the
                    kelp's holdfast -- the root-like part of the kelp that
                    anchors it to rocks or rock-bound organisms on the seafloor.
                    The stipe, or stem, attaches to the holdfast and supports
                    the blades, which typically float in the water, thanks to
                    air bladders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Looy's colleague, Steffen Kiel, dated these fossilized
                    holdfasts, which still grasp clams and envelop barnacles and
                    snails, to 32.1 million years ago, in the middle of the
                    Cenozoic Era, which stretches from 66 million years ago to
                    the present. The oldest previously known kelp fossil,
                    consisting of one air bladder and a blade similar to that of
                    today's bull kelp, dates from 14 million years ago and is in
                    the collection of the University of California Museum of
                    Paleontology (UCMP).

                    HZO specializes in thin film coatings for electronic
                    devices. At CES 2024, the North Carolina-based company
                    demonstrated the effectiveness of its coating process by
                    submerging a Raspberry Pi board. Remarkably, the board
                    continued working just fine and no one got electrocuted.

                  <p>
                    HZO offers innovative coating services using parylene,
                    applied as a film at the "molecular level" through a vacuum
                    deposition process. Parylene, thinner than other coating
                    materials, is capable of uniformly and reliably covering
                    electronic devices, including bare circuit boards. The
                    company showed the parylene coating protection at work
                    during CES 2024, suggesting that hardware companies could
                    turn Raspberry Pi 4 boards into proper waterproof computer
                    projects.

                    consumer electronics, biosensors, and more. The
                    parylene-coated Raspberry Pi 4, displayed

                    power cable and a microHDMI cable for video output, both
                    also coated with parylene.

                    Waterproof Raspberry Pi systems have been demonstrated
                    before, using a widely available lubricant (CorrosionX) as a
                    slimy bathing solution. This coating method isn't permanent,
                    in contrast, HZO's CVD solution offers a more durable
                    alternative. An company rep mentioned that electronic
                    devices like the Raspberry Pi would need approximately 15
                    hours in the deposition chamber.

                  <p>
                    Last week an important judicial ruling came down on a very
                    intriguing case about open source license compliance. In
                    this post, I'll talk about what makes it so interesting and
                    potentially impactful across our industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>Legal background</p>
                  <p>
                    Traditionally, open source licenses have been enforced
                    through the law of copyright. In other words, the key
                    question has been did copying occur, and if so, were the
                    rights of the author violated? This has a subtle, but very
                    important effect: only the author can initiate the lawsuit.
                    In addition in the United States, such lawsuits must be
                    filed in federal court, rather than in state courts, and the
                    remedies available are primarily financial.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, arguably, open source licenses could also be
                    enforced through the law of contracts. Contracts can be
                    about copyright, but in general they are a different beast.
                    In the United States, remedies for contracts can include
                    what is called "specific performance"—in other words, a
                    judge can order someone who has broken a contract to do a
                    specific act. Contracts also are typically enforced through
                    state courts, not federal courts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, and most importantly for our discussion today,
                    contracts can—under certain conditions—be enforced by third
                    parties. These parties are known as third-party
                    beneficiaries. Because they benefit from the contract, they
                    can sometimes enforce the contract. For example, if I signed
                    a contract with a baker to deliver a cake to my mother, my
                    mother would be able to sue the baker if the cake did not
                    arrive.

                    Wind Energy Ireland said the sector is saving millions of
                    tonnes of carbon, but that planning reform and grid
                    reinforcement is required for Ireland to become energy
                    independent.

                    Wind energy hit a new record in Ireland and cut spending on
                    gas by almost €1.3bn last year, according to a new report.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These findings come from the annual report of Wind Energy
                    Ireland, which shows that Ireland’s wind farms supplied 35pc
                    of the country’s electricity in 2023, a

                    [...] “Electricity generated from Irish wind farms replaces
                    imported fossil fuels,” Cunniffe said. “Our members can be
                    proud of the role Irish wind farms are playing in supporting
                    Irish electricity consumers and reducing our carbon
                    emissions. It is a true success story, and we are on the way
                    to an energy independent future for Ireland.”

                  <p>
                    [...] “We cannot get the power to where it is needed without
                    support for EirGrid and ESB Networks to develop a much
                    stronger electricity grid,” he said. “Progress to date on
                    the Planning and Development Bill has been welcomed by
                    industry and the Government’s plan to put in place mandatory
                    timelines for planning decisions as part of the new
                    legislation needs to be fully supported.

                  <p>
                    “Both planning reform and grid reinforcement must remain top
                    priorities right across the political system in 2024.”

                    One of the ambitious goals in Ireland’s Climate Action Plan
                    is to have 80pc of the country’s electricity come from wind
                    and solar energy sources by 2030. But a KPMG report at the
                    end of 2023 claimed that 95pc of consulted experts

                    On Thursday, Internet pioneer Vint Cerf announced that Dr.
                    David L. Mills, the inventor of

                    >
                    (NTP), died peacefully at age 85 on January 17, 2024. The
                    announcement came in a post on the Internet Society mailing
                    list after Cerf was informed of David's death by Mills'
                    daughter, Leigh.

                  <p>
                    Dr. Mills created the Network Time Protocol (NTP) in 1985 to
                    address a crucial challenge in the online world: the
                    synchronization of time across different computer systems
                    and networks. In a digital environment where computers and
                    servers are located all over the world, each with its own
                    internal clock, there's a significant need for a
                    standardized and accurate timekeeping system.

                    Black holes are one of the most powerful forces in the
                    universe, but we had never seen one until the Event Horizon

                    of the same M87 black hole, created with the aid of an
                    additional telescope and independent data from 2018, that
                    better displays the insane physics behind these supermassive
                    objects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first image was captured in 2017 (it takes a long time
                    to process the data) using eight high-altitude telescopes
                    from locations including Chile and Antarctica. The complex
                    technique required the synchronization of atomic clocks, use
                    of the Earth's rotation and processing of petabytes of RAW
                    telescope data. The result was slightly fuzzy, but clearly
                    showed the expected "donut" with the black hole at the
                    center and accretion disk made of matter inhaled from nearby
                    stars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the EHT collaboration captured another image a year
                    later using an additional telescope in Greenland. That
                    "significantly" improved the image fidelity, particularly in
                    the north-south direction, according to the EHT. One of the
                    original platforms, The Large Millimeter Telescope, also
                    gained sensitivity by using its full 50 meter surface for
                    the first time. The teams also introduced new data analysis
                    techniques that boosted accuracy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The result is a sharper and brighter image that also clearly

                    "The biggest change, that the brightness peak shifted around
                    the ring, is actually something we predicted when we
                    published the first results in 2019," said Dr. Britt Jeter
                    from Taiwan's ASIAA. "While general relativity says the ring
                    size should stay pretty fixed, the emission from the
                    turbulent, messy accretion disk around the black hole will
                    cause the brightest part of the ring to wobble around a
                    common center. The amount of wobble we see over time is
                    something we can use to test our theories for the magnetic
                    field and plasma environment around the black hole."

                    >
                    by German researchers from Leipzig University,
                    Bauhaus-University Weimar, and the Center for Scalable Data
                    Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. The researchers posed
                    the question "Is Google Getting Worse?", examining 7,392
                    product review queries on Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo for a
                    year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers worked off reports that "a torrent of
                    low-quality content, especially for product search, keeps
                    drowning any kind of useful information in search results."
                    A significant amount of results found in response to
                    product-related queries were "outright SEO product review
                    spam."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research showed that spam sites are hyper prevalent,
                    showing up at the top of Google's rankings in what is "a
                    constant battle" between the sites and search engine. In
                    other words, they write, "search engines seem to lose the
                    cat-and-mouse game that is SEO spam."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A Google spokesperson told Mashable that the study
                    "doesn't reflect the overall quality and helpfulness of
                    Search." They emphasized that the study only focuses on a
                    narrow set of queries – namely product search.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We conclude that dynamic adversarial spam in the form
                    of low-quality, mass-produced commercial content deserves
                    more attention," wrote the researchers.

                    host a press conference with NASA on Thursday January 18 at

                    Peregrine has so far hung on much longer than anyone thought
                    it would after the leak was first detected on January 8, and
                    Astrobotic has been posting round-the-clock status updates.
                    The company days ago ruled out a soft landing on the moon’s
                    surface, but there’s been some uncertainty about where
                    exactly it’ll end up. Peregrine did manage to make it to
                    lunar distance — reaching

                    because of where the moon currently is in its orbit, nothing
                    was there to meet it.

                    that a well-known tech company contacted him about Naz.API,
                    a collection of one billion credentials. "Unlike similar
                    lists that are merely collections of login names and
                    passwords from previous data breaches, this dataset includes
                    25 million passwords that had never been leaked before," he
                    writes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Hunt found that Naz.API contained 319 files totaling
                    104GB and 70,840,771 unique email addresses. It impacted
                    427,308 individual HIBP subscribers, and 65.03% of the
                    addresses are already in HIBP (based on a random sample set
                    of 1,000).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fact a third of the email addresses have never been seen
                    in previous leaks is significant. In the forum post that
                    included the database, the poster stated that it was created
                    by extracting data from stealer logs. This form of malware
                    attempts to steal data from infected machines, such as
                    passwords, credit card details, crypto wallets, and more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hunt posted a screenshot of the dataset that showed some of
                    the stolen data. The passwords appear in plaintext rather
                    than being hashed and many are incredibly simple,

                    strings. As we've seen so many times before and often warned
                    against, there's a huge number of people using the same
                    password/email address combo across multiple services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hunt contacted some people on the list to confirm that their
                    credentials are or were at one time accurate. He also
                    confirmed that a selection of emails were associated with
                    the named websites, which include Facebook, Roblox,
                    Coinbase, Yammer, and Yahoo.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not all of the data comes from stealer malware. A large
                    percentage are the result of credential stuffing, which
                    collates data from previous breaches. One of Hunt's own
                    passwords appeared in the data, though he hasn't used it
                    since pre-2011.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Some of this data does not come from malware and has been
                    around for a significant period of time," he wrote. "My own
                    email address, for example, accompanied a password not used
                    for well over a decade and did not accompany a website
                    indicating it was sourced from malware."

                    the massive amount of data was posted to a well-known
                    underground market that brokers sales of compromised
                    credentials. Hunt said he often pays little attention to
                    dumps like these because they simply compile and repackage
                    previously published passwords taken in earlier campaigns.

                  <p>
                    Some glaring things prevented Hunt from dismissing this one,
                    specifically the contents indicating that nearly 25 million
                    of the passwords had never been leaked before:

                    “That last number was the real kicker,” Hunt wrote. “When a
                    third of the email addresses have never been seen before,
                    that's statistically significant. This isn't just the usual
                    collection of repurposed lists wrapped up with a brand-new

                    significant volume of new data. When you look at the above
                    forum post the data accompanied, the reason why becomes
                    clear: it's from ‘stealer logs’ or in other words, malware
                    that has grabbed credentials from compromised machines.”

                    [...] The two studied solar sites were planted with native
                    grasses and flowering plants in early 2018. From August 2018
                    through August 2022, the researchers conducted 358
                    observational surveys for flowering vegetation and insect
                    communities. They evaluated changes in plant and insect
                    abundance and diversity with each visit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The effort to obtain these data was considerable, returning
                    to each site four times per summer to record pollinator
                    counts," said Heidi Hartmann, manager of the Land Resources
                    and Energy Policy Program in Argonne's Environmental
                    Sciences division, and one of the study's co-authors. "Over
                    time we saw the numbers and types of flowering plants
                    increase as the habitat matured. Measuring the corresponding
                    positive impact for pollinators was very gratifying."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By the end of the field campaign, the team had observed
                    increases for all habitat and biodiversity metrics. There
                    was an increase in native plant species diversity and flower
                    abundance. In addition, the team observed increases in the
                    abundance and diversity of native insect pollinators and
                    agriculturally beneficial insects, which included honeybees,
                    native bees, wasps, hornets, hoverflies, other flies, moths,
                    butterflies and beetles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Flowers and flowering plant species increased as well. Total
                    insect abundance tripled, while native bees showed a 20-fold
                    increase in numbers. The most numerous insect groups
                    observed were beetles, flies and moths.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an added benefit, the researchers found that pollinators
                    from the solar sites also visited soybean flowers in
                    adjacent crop fields, providing additional pollination
                    services.<br />Global insect biodiversity has been in
                    decline due to habitat loss, pesticides and climate change.
                    Restoration of insect habitat paired with smart land use
                    changes toward renewable energy developments could help
                    reverse the course.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For instance, as a carbon-neutral source of
                    electricity, expanded PV solar energy development is
                    critical to mitigating climate change. According to the
                    DOE's Solar Futures Study, approximately 10 million acres of
                    land in the U.S. will be needed for large-scale solar
                    development by 2050 in order to meet grid decarbonization
                    and climate change goals. But some lands are better suited
                    for PV solar development than others. Disturbed lands such
                    as former agricultural fields are ideal locations to hold
                    rows of solar panels compared to lands that have been
                    previously undisturbed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even more strategies can be added to this winning
                    combination to support insect conservation. Agrivoltaics is
                    the combination of solar energy production with agricultural
                    and vegetation management practices. One type of
                    agrivoltaics focuses on the establishment of habitat for
                    insect pollinators and other wildlife that can provide
                    important ecosystem services, such as pollination.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pairing solar energy facilities on previously disturbed
                    lands with habitat enhancement sounds like a logical win-win
                    strategy to address energy and biodiversity challenges. To
                    date, however, there has been little field data available to
                    document the feasibility and the ecological benefits of this
                    novel land use approach.

                    Periodically, the door would open, the light would turn on,
                    and a petite, dark-haired graduate student named Sarah
                    Meiklejohn would enter the room and add to the growing piles
                    of miscellaneous artifacts. Then Meiklejohn would walk back
                    out the door, down the hall, up the stairs, and into an
                    office she shared with other graduate students at the UC San
                    Diego computer science department. One wall of the room was
                    almost entirely glass, and it looked out onto the sunbaked
                    vista of Sorrento Valley and the rolling hills beyond. But
                    Meiklejohn’s desk faced away from that expanse. She was
                    wholly focused on the screen of her laptop, where she was
                    quickly becoming one of the strangest, most hyperactive
                    Bitcoin users in the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meiklejohn had personally purchased every one of the dozens
                    of items in the bizarre, growing collection in the UCSD
                    closet using bitcoin, buying each one almost at random from
                    a different vendor who accepted the cryptocurrency. And
                    between those ecommerce orders and trips to the storage
                    room, she was performing practically every other task that a
                    person could carry out with bitcoin, all at once, like a
                    kind of cryptocurrency fanatic having a manic episode.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She moved money into and out of 10 different bitcoin wallet
                    services and converted dollars to bitcoins on more than two
                    dozen exchanges such as Bitstamp, Mt. Gox, and Coinbase. She
                    wagered those coins on 13 different online gambling
                    services, with names like Satoshi Dice and Bitcoin Kamikaze.
                    She contributed her computer’s mining power to 11 different
                    mining “pools,” groups that collected users’ computing power
                    for mining bitcoins and then paid them a share of the
                    profits. And, again and again, she moved bitcoins into and
                    then out of accounts on the Silk Road, the first-ever
                    dark-web drug market, without ever actually buying any
                    drugs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In all, Meiklejohn carried out 344 cryptocurrency
                    transactions over the course of a few weeks. With each one,
                    she carefully noted on a spreadsheet the amount, the Bitcoin
                    address she had used for it, and then, after digging up the
                    transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain and examining the
                    public record of the payment, the address of the recipient
                    or sender.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meiklejohn’s hundreds of purchases, bets, and seemingly
                    meaningless movements of money were not, in fact, signs of a
                    psychotic break. Each was a tiny experiment, adding up to a
                    study of a kind that had never been attempted before. After
                    years of claims about Bitcoin’s anonymity—or lack
                    thereof—made by its users, its developers, and even its
                    creator, Meiklejohn was finally putting its privacy
                    properties to the test.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All of her meticulous, manual transactions were
                    time-consuming and tedious. But Meiklejohn had time to kill:
                    As she was carrying them out and recording the results, her
                    computer was simultaneously running queries on a massive
                    database stored on a server that she and her fellow UCSD
                    researchers had set up, algorithms that sometimes took as
                    long as 12 hours to spit out results. The database
                    represented the entire Bitcoin blockchain, the roughly 16
                    million transactions that had occurred across the entire
                    Bitcoin economy since its creation four years earlier. For
                    weeks on end, Meiklejohn combed through those transactions
                    while simultaneously tagging the vendors, services, markets,
                    and other recipients on the other end of her hundreds of
                    test transactions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When she had started that process of probing the Bitcoin
                    ecosystem, Meiklejohn had seen her work almost as
                    anthropology: What were people doing with bitcoin? How many
                    of them were saving the cryptocurrency versus spending it?
                    But as her initial findings began to unfold, she had started
                    to develop a much more specific goal, one that ran exactly
                    counter to crypto-anarchists’ idealized notion of bitcoin as
                    the ultimate privacy-preserving currency of the dark web:
                    She aimed to prove, beyond any doubt, that bitcoin
                    transactions could very often be traced. Even when the
                    people involved thought they were anonymous.

                    Plastics are now omnipresent in our daily lives. The
                    existence of microplastics (1 µm to 5 mm in length) and
                    possibly even nanoplastics (&lt;1 μm) has recently raised
                    health concerns. In particular, nanoplastics are believed to
                    be more toxic since their smaller size renders them much
                    more amenable, compared to microplastics, to enter the human
                    body.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, detecting nanoplastics imposes tremendous
                    analytical challenges on both the nano-level sensitivity and
                    the plastic-identifying specificity, leading to a knowledge
                    gap in this mysterious nanoworld surrounding us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To address these challenges, we developed a hyperspectral
                    stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging platform with an
                    automated plastic identification algorithm that allows
                    micro-nano plastic analysis at the single-particle level
                    with high chemical specificity and throughput. We first
                    validated the sensitivity enhancement of the narrow band of
                    SRS to enable high-speed single nanoplastic detection below
                    100 nm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We then devised a data-driven spectral matching algorithm to
                    address spectral identification challenges imposed by
                    sensitive narrow-band hyperspectral imaging and achieve
                    robust determination of common plastic polymers. With the
                    established technique, we studied the micro-nano plastics
                    from bottled water as a model system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We successfully detected and identified nanoplastics from
                    major plastic types. Micro-nano plastics concentrations were
                    estimated to be about 2.4 ± 1.3 × 10<sup>5</sup> particles
                    per liter of bottled water, about 90% of which are
                    nanoplastics. This is orders of magnitude more than the
                    microplastic abundance reported previously in bottled water.
                    High-throughput single-particle counting revealed
                    extraordinary particle heterogeneity and nonorthogonality
                    between plastic composition and morphologies; the resulting
                    multidimensional profiling sheds light on the science of
                    nanoplastics.

                    Most of us are familiar with yawn contagion, which is the
                    act of spontaneous yawning when someone nearby yawns, often
                    but not always audibly. For humans, yawning can emanate from
                    fatigue or boredom, and either seeing or hearing someone
                    else yawn may start a chain reaction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many animal species also yawn when they're tired, and yawn
                    contagion is known to occur among various social animals
                    including certain apes, monkeys, lemurs, pigs, wolves,
                    domestic dogs, lions, spotted hyenas, and more. But other
                    than humans, only one species—the gelada (Theropithecus
                    gelada), a species of Old World monkey—is known to yawn
                    audibly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Earlier studies have explored yawn contagion within and
                    between various species; for example, some work has shown
                    that dogs will yawn in response to the sound of human yawns.
                    But to date, there have been no known studies on
                    intraspecific audibly-triggered yawn contagion in a
                    non-human species.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now a research team from France and Italy has specifically
                    studied how the sound of gelada yawns affects their
                    conspecifics. The team's work is
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-49797-5"
                      >published</a
                    >
                    in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Geladas, also known as bleeding-heart monkeys, are endemic
                    to Ethiopia. They live in multi-level societies that include
                    units, teams, bands, and communities. Core units either
                    include a single reproductive adult male with multiple adult
                    females, their young, and at least one follower male; or
                    only young adult and adolescent males no longer living
                    within their birth units.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similar to humans, geladas enjoy rich and complex vocal
                    communication. According to the new study, "A similar
                    evolutionary social landscape, with similar challenges
                    (e.g., need of group coordination with subjects not always
                    in visual contact), has indeed possibly led to the emergence
                    of multimodal communication in both species."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Existing findings show that yawning geladas, mostly males,
                    emit a loud vocal sound that does not arise solely from
                    inhaling and exhaling. While the researchers behind this
                    study knew that visually-based yawn contagion could affect
                    geladas, they wanted to find out whether the sound of
                    yawning without a visual cue would result in a similar
                    effect.

                    Traditionally, scientists believed that isotopic effects in
                    biochemical reactions were more or less proportional to the
                    mass difference between isotopes. For instance, a 0.5% mass
                    difference between normal and ultralight enzymes (molecules

                    Indian billionaire and Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy
                    has doubled down on his comments that India’s youth should
                    voluntarily work 70-hour weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Murthy’s first call for very long working hours came in
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/27/infosys_founder_70_hour_week/"

                    >
                    2023, when he called on the nation’s youth to work long
                    hours out of a sense of duty to the nation. He suggested the
                    young “work twelve-hour days for the next 20 years, 50 years
                    whatever it is.“
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new interview posted this week,
                    <em>India Today</em> consulting editor Rajdeep Sardesai
                    asked Murthy if he sticks by his 70-hour plan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Absolutely,” he answered. “I don’t think 70 is important,
                    all that it means is that you are productive, work very hard
                    like the Germans did after World War II, like Japanese did.
                    We owe it to the poor people to work hard and make the
                    quality of their life a little bit better.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Narayana Murthy said he doesn’t really have regrets
                    over missing important events in his children’s lives as he
                    “always believed quality was more important than quantity.”
                    He detailed he would leave for the office at 06:00, return
                    around 21:15, expect his kids to be ready at the gate on his
                    arrival, whereupon all would jump in the car and grab dinner
                    together.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “We used to have lots of fun during that time. That hour and
                    a half, two hours were the most relaxing for the children,”
                    said Murthy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Infosys co-founder described his long hours at
                    work as a “puny” effort compared to the accomplishments of
                    India's historical leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, other
                    heroes of India’s independence movement, and the nation’s
                    early prime ministers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “So we should not even make this a big deal," he commented.
                    He added that Mahatma Gandhi hardly ever saw his children.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “All the extraordinary heroes, if I could do one millionth
                    of what they did, I think our family would be happy, I would
                    be happy,” the former exec said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And as we noted when we covered Murthy’s first remarks
                    about 70-hour weeks, requiring employees to work such hours
                    appears to be illegal under Indian law.

                    Researchers from LUISS Guido Carli University have published
                    a new study that examines whether and how subtle shifts in
                    language arousal might shape consumer engagement and the way

                    "How High-Arousal Language Shapes Micro Versus Macro
                    Influencers' Impact" and is authored by Giovanni Luca Cascio
                    Rizzo, Francisco Villarroel Ordenes, Rumen Pozharliev,
                    Matteo De Angelis, and Michele Costabile.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Companies increasingly turn to popular social media
                    personalities to promote their brands, products, and
                    services. The influencer marketing economy was valued at
                    $21.1 billion in 2023, and more than 90% of brands enlist
                    influencers with a small audience (micro) or with massive
                    reach (macro) to connect with consumers and achieve a
                    variety of marketing goals, from creating awareness to
                    increasing sales.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Influencers have the potential to diffuse marketing messages
                    and drive actions, but it is unclear why some of their posts
                    get a lot of engagement while others do not. One possibility
                    is that consumers are increasingly aware that influencers
                    get paid to promote products, raising questions about their
                    motives. Additionally, anecdotal evidence suggests that when
                    influencers use high-arousal language (e.g., "it's totally
                    amazing!"), it leads to questions about their
                    trustworthiness, which in turn leads consumers to engage
                    less with the content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Consumers typically see micro influencers as regular people,
                    so if they say something like "this shake is AMAZING!"
                    consumers believe they really are excited about that shake
                    and just want to share this discovery with their friends and
                    followers. This belief in their sincerity increases
                    consumers' trust in micro influencers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, macro influencers do not seem like regular people.
                    Consumers know these influencers receive substantial sums to
                    say positive things about products, so they judge their
                    posts as an attempt to persuade, just like any other form of
                    advertising. Believing that someone has manipulative
                    intentions tends to decrease trust. Yet the negative effect
                    of high arousal posts by macro influencers could be
                    mitigated if their posts offer more informative (vs.
                    commercial) content or if the messages are more balanced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This research underscores the importance of aligning
                    social media posts and language arousal strategies depending
                    on the type of influencer. For micro influencers, using
                    high-arousal language authentically can enhance engagement,
                    but macro influencers should focus more on informative
                    content to maintain their trustworthiness.

                    infosec professionals, Internet security enthusiasts, and
                    sysadmins, it is crucial to understand the implications of
                    these vulnerabilities and the impact they may have on our
                    work. Let's have a closer look at these flaws, how they
                    work, their impact on Linux users, and how to mitigate your
                    risk.

                    Researchers have discovered zero-click Bluetooth flaws that
                    enable attackers to secretly pair with devices as keyboards
                    and inject keystrokes without user interaction. The
                    vulnerabilities affect Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and
                    Windows, posing a serious threat to billions of devices
                    worldwide. Bluetooth technologies power wireless keyboards,
                    mice, game controllers, and other peripherals used by
                    billions of devices around the globe, highlighting the
                    widespread nature of these vulnerabilities and the potential
                    for malicious actors to exploit them across various
                    platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Linux Bluetooth implementation allows keyboards to
                    initiate pairing without authentication or user confirmation
                    (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45866"
                      >CVE-2023-45866</a
                    >). This means that an attacker could remotely pair as a
                    Bluetooth keyboard and inject keystrokes without the user's
                    knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The implications of these vulnerabilities are significant.
                    They expose a potential attack vector that could compromise
                    a wide range of devices. For Linux admins, it highlights the
                    importance of keeping Bluetooth settings secure and applying
                    the available patch in BlueZ.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Infosec professionals and sysadmins must be aware of the
                    vulnerabilities within their respective operating systems
                    and take necessary measures to mitigate the risks, such as

                      >promptly applying patches</a
                    >
                    as they are released by their distribution(s). Additionally,
                    it raises questions about the overall security of Bluetooth
                    technology and the need for cryptographic authentication and
                    consent for all pairing attempts.

                    The last commercial supersonic jet, the Concorde, last flew
                    over two decades ago, in 2003. It only traveled
                    supersonically across the Atlantic Ocean, and while cutting
                    international travel time in half while cruising at some
                    1,350 mph, it ultimately failed economically. The plane's
                    route was limited — because it couldn't fly over land. But
                    that was only part of the problem.

                    prices," the Smithsonian's van der Linden explained. "The
                    high ticket prices were caused by the very high fuel
                    consumption." (A

                    NASA's QueSST mission won't address the fuel that supersonic
                    engines gulp. Airplane makers, and airlines, will almost
                    certainly need to bring fuel costs down to even attract
                    customers that can currently afford the highest-priced,
                    first class-type seating.

                    A Northwestern University team has demonstrated a remarkable
                    new way to generate electricity, with a paperback-sized
                    device that nestles in soil and harvests power created as
                    microbes break down dirt – for as long as there's carbon in
                    the soil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microbial fuel cells, as they're called, have been around
                    for more than 100 years. They work a little like a battery,
                    with an anode, cathode and electrolyte – but rather than
                    drawing electricity from chemical sources, they work with
                    bacteria that naturally donate electrons to nearby
                    conductors as they chow down on soil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The issue thus far has been keeping them supplied with water
                    and oxygen, while being buried in the dirt. "Although MFCs
                    have existed as a concept for more than a century, their
                    unreliable performance and low output power have stymied
                    efforts to make practical use of them, especially in
                    low-moisture conditions," said UNW alumnus and project lead
                    Bill Yen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, the team set about creating several new designs targeted
                    at giving the cells continual access to oxygen and water –
                    and found success with a design shaped like a cartridge
                    sitting vertically on a horizontal disc. The disc-shaped
                    carbon felt anode lies horizontally at the bottom of the
                    device, buried deep in the soil where it can capture
                    electrons as microbes digest dirt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The conductive metal cathode, meanwhile, sits vertically on
                    top of the anode. The bottom part thus sits deep enough to
                    have access to moisture from the deep soil, while the top
                    sits flush with the surface. A fresh air gap runs down the
                    whole length of the electrode, and a protective cap on top
                    stops dirt and debris from falling in and cutting off the
                    cathode's access to oxygen. Part of the cathode is also
                    coated with a waterproofing material, so that when it
                    floods, there's still a hydrophobic section of the cathode
                    in touch with oxygen to keep the fuel cell running.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In testing, this design performed consistently across
                    different soil moisture levels, from completely underwater
                    to "somewhat dry," with just 41% water by volume in the
                    soil. On average, it generated some 68 times more power than
                    was required to operate its onboard moisture and touch
                    detection systems, and transmit data via a tiny antenna to a
                    nearby base station.

                    In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the loss of the
                    only gene copy of CPR5 results in a broad spectrum of
                    resistance to viruses, bacteria, and fungi. However, growth
                    is severely restricted; the plants exhibit spontaneous
                    lesions and produce low yields. So, it was important to test
                    whether rymv2 resistance could be transferred to other rice
                    varieties without negative consequences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Africa, other high-yield rice varieties based on the
                    Asian species Oryza indica are mainly used, and these do not
                    have the resistance gene. Inserting the relevant gene is,
                    however, not a particularly promising approach as the
                    descendants of such "inter-species" hybrids are highly
                    sterile and, therefore, cannot reproduce and pass on the
                    resistance easily.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using the CRISPR/Cas genome editing method, the research
                    group has now shown that mutations of the RYMV2 gene can be
                    produced in an Asian rice variety that make it resistant to
                    the virus in a similar way to the African form. In the next
                    step, the aim is to edit relevant African elite varieties in
                    the same way to make them available to African small-scale
                    producers. Helping these farmers is the goal of the
                    international research consortium "Healthy Crops," which is
                    headed by HHU.

                    In December 2023, Nikon, Sony, and Canon announced their bid
                    to keep photographers and videographers safe from
                    misattribution and deepfakes of their work. Aside from just
                    watermarking their images, these camera manufacturers have
                    proposed the use of digital signatures as the new global
                    standard for media professionals. Although, ordinary
                    photographers, videographers, and other hobbyists, can also
                    stand to benefit from these efforts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to
                    <a

                      >Nikkei</a
                    >, these three Japanese brands hold a whopping 84.3% global
                    market share for the camera industry, which includes
                    everything from compact cameras to higher-end DLSRs. After a
                    15.2% decrease in sales in the last year, it's no wonder
                    that they're leading the charge to fight against
                    AI-generated images and working to protect their customers.

                    For Sony camera users, you can expect a firmware update for
                    existing mirrorless cameras. On the other hand, Nikon and
                    Canon users will have to wait a little longer for succeeding
                    models for the digital signature feature. Although Canon
                    plans to reward their users with some additional features,
                    such as a built-in authentication feature with video
                    watermarking in 2024.

                    The ULTRA-LUX project, led by technology company Imec, has
                    developed a new type of light-emitting diode (LED) – known
                    as perovskite LEDs (PeLED) – that might one day consign OLED
                    displays to history.

                    Researchers with the ULTRA-LUX project, however, have
                    wielded the potential of perovskite – a class of material
                    with a specialized crystal structure – to serve as the
                    semiconductor in LED-based displays. In doing so, they've
                    created a display technology that can be up to 1000 times
                    brighter than state-of-the-art OLEDs, according to research
                    published in Nature.

                    This material, which is used in solar-powered cells, can
                    withstand very high current densities, but hasn't been used
                    in such a way as to emit light in a display. Using their
                    architecture, Imec demonstrated the potential of PeLEDs in
                    future displays, and the researchers now plan on building
                    one.

                    It may well be a good few years, however, before we start to
                    see displays on the market powered by this kind of display
                    technology, given there's a fair amount of research and
                    engineering still to be done.

                    It's a common sight at many retail stores: a queue of
                    people, waiting to use a self-checkout kiosk, doing their
                    best to remain patient as a lone store worker attends to
                    multiple malfunctioning machines. The frustration mounts
                    while a dozen darkened, roped-off and cashier-less tills sit
                    in the background.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For shoppers, self-checkout was supposed to provide
                    convenience and speed. Retailers hoped it would usher in a
                    new age of cost savings. Their thinking: why pay six
                    employees when you could pay one to oversee customers at
                    self-service registers, as they do their own labour of
                    scanning and bagging for free?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While self-checkout technology has its theoretical selling
                    points for both consumers and businesses, it mostly isn't
                    living up to expectations. Customers are still queueing.
                    They need store employees to help clear kiosk errors or
                    check their identifications for age-restricted items. Stores
                    still need to have workers on-hand to help them, and to
                    service the machines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The technology is, in some cases, more trouble than it's
                    worth.

                    [...] Many retail companies have invested millions – if not
                    billions – of dollars in self-checkout technology, which
                    Andrews says was first developed during the 1980s, and
                    started appearing in stores in the 1990s. They're not
                    exactly cheap to get into stores: some experts estimate a
                    four-kiosk system can run six figures.

                    of self-checkout technology is that, in many cases, it

                    [...] According to the TU Darmstadt researchers, Apple has
                    known since at least 2019 that AirDrop leaks the real-world
                    identities of users. To this day, however, Apple has never
                    publicly discussed or acknowledged any aspect of the
                    leakage, including whether the company has plans to replace
                    AirDrop's hash-based PSI with a more secure PSI, such as one
                    devised by the researchers. Apple representatives didn't
                    respond to an email Thursday asking once again if it was
                    aware of the leakage and if it has any plans to plug it.

                    [...] For now, there's nothing AirDrop users can do to
                    prevent their phone number and email address from being
                    leaked, short of configuring the feature to "receiving off"
                    and never initiating a send. Any protection beyond that will
                    require the active participation of Apple, which so far has
                    maintained radio silence on the topic.

                    In an article published on its official WeChat account on

                    Wangshendongjian Technology Co Ltd had "broken through the
                    technical difficulties of tracing anonymous AirDrops".

                    The firm "prevented the further spread and potential bad
                    influence of inappropriate speech" on the Beijing subway,
                    when a passenger's iPhone received an unacceptable video via

                    but said Wangshendongjian analysed the iPhone's logs and
                    found the sender's mobile number and email address in the
                    form of hash values, some of them hidden.

                  <p>
                    Wangshendongjian then used a "rainbow table" of cracked
                    passwords to decode enough information from the files to
                    help police "identify several suspects", according to the

                    really <em>new</em>; it dates back to 2019, when a set of TU
                    Darmstadt researchers — Heinrich, Hollick, Schneider, Stute,
                    and Weinert — reverse-engineered the Apple Airdrop protocol
                    and disclosed several privacy issues to Apple. (The

                    of "unauthorized" AirDrop materials, using a technique based
                    on rainbow tables. While this new capability may not (yet)

                    D&amp;D and Magic: The Gathering publisher, Wizards of the

                    after someone who received some unreleased
                    <em>Magic</em> cards in error, the company appears to have
                    taken a draconian turn in recent years. Then, over the
                    summer, there was a bunch of backlash when WotC was found to
                    have included art from one of its artists that had been
                    <a

                      >partially generated using AI generative art</a
                    >
                    in one of its books. After that whole fiasco, WotC publicly
                    swore off using any art in its products that was not 100%
                    human created.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And it’s important to note that this is a huge thing in the
                    D&amp;D and <em>Magic</em> worlds. The books, cards, and
                    associated items that players and fans buy from these games
                    have always been revered in part for the fantastic art that
                    has come along with them. And the artists contributing to
                    them have been equally celebrated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, when sharp-eyed observers of recent promotional art that
                    came out for <em>Magic</em> pointed out it sure looked like
                    the images <em>around</em> the cards showed signs of having
                    been generated by AI, well, WotC

                  <p>
                    [...] But, no, it turns out that the images around the cards
                    was in fact

                  <p>
                    [...] But the real lesson here is that companies have to be
                    very careful with this sort of thing. The internet has
                    enough well-trained Sherlocks out there who are holding
                    companies to their word, looking for anywhere where AI
                    generated content is being snuck in to replace human-made
                    content that, as the technology stands today, there’s a good
                    chance any such uses will be found out. They might as well
                    save themselves the trouble and just make sure the humans
                    are doing the work.

                  <p>
                    America's greenhouse gas emissions fell 1.9 percent in 2023,
                    in large part because the burning of coal to produce
                    electricity plummeted to its lowest level in half a century,
                    according to estimates published on Wednesday by the Rhodium
                    Group, a nonpartisan research firm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The drop means that United States emissions have now fallen
                    roughly 17.2 percent since 2005. There was a huge, anomalous
                    dip in planet-warming pollution at the start of the
                    coronavirus pandemic, when large segments of the economy
                    shut down, followed by a sharp rebound in the following two
                    years once activity resumed. But over the longer term,
                    America's emissions have been trending downward as power
                    plants and cars have gotten cleaner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the decline in emissions to date hasn't been nearly
                    steep enough to meet the nation's goals for trying to slow
                    global warming. President Biden wants to reduce America's
                    greenhouse gas emissions at least 50 percent below 2005
                    levels by 2030. To hit that goal, annual emissions would
                    have to fall more than three times as fast for the rest of
                    the decade as they did last year, the report found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers looked at planet-warming emissions generated
                    by transportation, electricity, industry and buildings but
                    did not include pollution from agriculture, which accounts
                    for roughly 10 percent of the nation's greenhouse gases.

                    The United States is one of 26 countries around the world
                    that have seen emissions decline in recent years even as
                    they enjoy significant economic growth, a study last year
                    found. That list also includes Brazil, Britain, Japan, much
                    of the European Union and South Africa.

                  <p>
                    But globally, carbon dioxide emissions still soared to
                    record levels last year, driven in large part by an increase
                    in fossil fuel use in China, India and other fast-growing
                    countries.

                    as opposed to the pre-rendered demos that are often more

                    in 2018, allowing Lucid to complete work on its factory in
                    Arizona and push on with developing the Air.

                  <p>
                    [...] But those big numbers were matched by an equally big
                    price—$169,000, or $139,000 for the slightly less powerful,
                    slightly shorter-range Air Grand Touring.

                  <p>
                    [...] Since then, the company added some cheaper variants to

                    its current incentives are taken into account. But that
                    hasn't resulted in a glut of orders.

                  <p>
                    For the last three months of 2023, Lucid built just 2,231
                    Air EVs and delivered 1,734 of those to customers. The
                    results for the whole year weren't any better—Lucid built
                    8,428 cars and delivered 6,001 of those.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    Chinese company Betavolt has announced an atomic energy
                    battery for consumers with a touted 50-year lifespan. The
                    Betavolt BV100 will be the first product to launch using the
                    firm's new atomic battery technology, constructed using a
                    nickel -63 isotope and diamond semiconductor material.
                    Betavolt says that its nuclear battery will target
                    aerospace, AI devices, medical, MEMS systems, intelligent
                    sensors, small drones, and robots – and may eventually mean
                    manufacturers can sell smartphones that never need charging.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Buying an electronics product that can go mains-free for 50
                    years would be amazing. However, the BV100, which is in the
                    pilot stage ahead of mass production, doesn't offer a lot of
                    power. This 15 x 15 x 5mm battery delivers 100 microwatts at
                    3 volts. It is mentioned that multiple BV100 batteries can
                    be used together in series or parallel depending on device
                    requirements. Betavolt also asserts that it has plans to
                    launch a 1-watt version of its atomic battery in 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In its press release, Betavolt says its atomic battery
                    is very different from similarly described power cells
                    developed by the US and USSR in the 1960s. It says that the
                    old nuclear batteries were large, dangerous, hot, and
                    expensive products. [...] Meanwhile, the Betavolt BV100 is
                    claimed to be safe for consumers and won't leak radiation
                    even if subjected to gunshots or puncture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new, improved levels of safety stem from the choice of
                    materials. Betavolt's battery uses a nickel -63 isotope as
                    the energy source, which decays to a stable isotope of
                    copper. This, plus the diamond semiconductor material, helps
                    the BV100 operate stably in environments ranging from -60 to
                    120 degrees Celsius, according to the firm.

                    An LG washing machine owner and self-confessed fintech geek
                    has asked the Twitterverse why his smart home appliance ate
                    an average of 3.66GB of data daily. Concerned about the
                    washer's internet addiction,

                    forced the device to go cold turkey and blocked it using his
                    router UI. Had the LG washer been hacked,

                    average data consumption for a modern smart appliance?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For now, it looks like the favored answer to the data
                    mystery is to blame Asus for misreporting it. We may never
                    know what happened with Johnie, who is now running his LG
                    washing machine offline. LG did not immediately reply to a
                    request by Tom's Hardware for more information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another relatively innocent reason for the supposed high
                    volume of uploads could be an error in the Asus router
                    firmware. In a
                    <a
                      href="https://twitter.com/Johnie/status/1745194782463508672"
                      >follow-up post</a
                    >
                    a day after his initial Tweet, Johnie noted "inaccuracy in
                    the ASUS router tool," with regard to Apple iMessage data
                    use. Other LG smart washing machine users showed device data
                    use from their router UIs. It turns out that these
                    appliances more typically use less than 1MB per day.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Though Johnie's Tweets were relatively light-hearted,
                    hacking smart connected devices can be severe. Consider what
                    could happen if medical or industrial IoT devices get taken
                    over by attackers, for example. A case in point is provided
                    by a story from earlier this week when Bosch
                    network-connected wrenches used in factories all around the
