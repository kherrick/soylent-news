                    The diversity of yeast species in Japan reflects the
                    latitudinal range of the Japanese archipelago. Shiga
                    prefecture's diverse biomes—hydrosphere, forests, and arable
                    land—and highly variable climate encourage this diversity.
                    Tanimura promotes continuing efforts to search for new
                    microbial resources in unexplored areas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] At publication, approximately 160 species were
                    reported as oleaginous yeast, producing more than 20% of
                    their dry cell weight as lipids.

                  <p>
                    "However, since lipid content easily changes with changing
                    conditions in culture, we may need to redefine the term
                    oleaginous yeast," notes Tanimura.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    Trilobites first appear early in the Cambrian and are one of
                    the earliest examples of arthropods, the group that includes
                    all insects. They flourished for over 100 million years,
                    leaving fossils that are seemingly ubiquitous—we've
                    described over 20,000 different trilobite species. That's
                    over three times the number of mammalian species we're aware
                    of.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite all those fossils, however, we've never found one
                    with a meal inside it. We've been able to infer what some of
                    them were likely to have been dining on based on their
                    appearance and the ecosystems they were found in, but we
                    haven't been able to establish what they ate with certainty.
                    But today, researchers are describing an exquisitely
                    preserved sample that includes several of the animal's last
                    meals, which suggests that this particular animal was a bit
                    like an aquatic vacuum cleaner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The one caution the researchers raise about this find
                    is that the feeding behavior of the trilobite may not be
                    entirely normal. There's a discontinuity in the animal's
                    shell between two of its segments, which can be an
                    indication that it's getting ready to molt. If that's the
                    case, the animal may have been overeating to generate
                    additional pressure to help it break out of its old shell.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, after tens of thousands of trilobite fossils, we finally
                    have one with food inside of it. Yet it seems to be from a
                    species that had a bizarre feeding pattern, and this
                    particular individual may have been sucking down more food
                    than usual. So, we'll probably need to find a few more of
                    these to get a better picture of what trilobites ate.

                    The exosuit could prove a useful tool for athletes looking
                    to speed up during training. "Although this is a preliminary
                    study, we can say the exosuit can augment the human ability
                    to run," says Giuk Lee, an associate professor at Chung-Ang
                    University in Seoul, South Korea, who led the research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lee and his team built a lightweight exosuit with steel
                    cables powered by electrical motors attached to the runner's
                    thighs. The motors pull the cables, mimicking the
                    contraction of muscles. The exosuit helps people run faster
                    by assisting their hip extension—the powerful motion that
                    propels a runner forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The exosuit tracks the wearer's lower-body movements in real
                    time through sensors on both thighs. This data feeds into an
                    algorithm designed to monitor gait, which works in tandem
                    with other algorithms to track each runner's individual
                    running style and speed.

                    Hackers backed by the Chinese government are planting
                    malware into routers that provides long-lasting and
                    undetectable backdoor access to the networks of
                    multinational companies in the US and Japan, governments in
                    both countries said Wednesday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The hacking group, tracked under names including BlackTech,
                    Palmerworm, Temp.Overboard, Circuit Panda, and Radio Panda,
                    has been operating since at least 2010, a joint advisory
                    published by government entities in the US and Japan
                    reported. The group has a history of targeting public
                    organizations and private companies in the US and East Asia.
                    The threat actor is somehow gaining administrator
                    credentials to network devices used by subsidiaries and
                    using that control to install malicious firmware that can be
                    triggered with "magic packets" to perform specific tasks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The hackers then use control of those devices to infiltrate
                    networks of companies that have trusted relationships with
                    the breached subsidiaries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Specifically, upon gaining an initial foothold into a
                    target network and gaining administrator access to network
                    edge devices, BlackTech cyber actors often modify the
                    firmware to hide their activity across the edge devices to
                    further maintain persistence in the network," officials
                    wrote in Wednesday's advisory. "To extend their foothold
                    across an organization, BlackTech actors target branch
                    routers—typically smaller appliances used at remote branch
                    offices to connect to a corporate headquarters—and then
                    abuse the trusted relationship of the branch routers within
                    the corporate network being targeted. BlackTech actors then
                    use the compromised public-facing branch routers as part of
                    their infrastructure for proxying traffic, blending in with
                    corporate network traffic, and pivoting to other victims on
                    the same corporate network."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To install their modified bootloader, the US and
                    Japanese advisory said, the threat actors install an older
                    version of the legitimate firmware and then modify it as it
                    runs in memory. The technique overrides signature checks in
                    the Cisco ROM monitor signature validation functions,
                    specifically functions of Cisco's IOS Image Load test and
                    the Field Upgradeable ROMMON Integrity test. The modified
                    firmware, which consists of a Cisco IOS loader that installs
                    an embedded IOS image, allows the compromised routers to
                    make connections over SSH without being recorded in event
                    logs.

                A lot of academic research is funded from government grants from
                agencies like NSF. For grants that have already been approved,
                universities can continue to conduct research. However, the
                shutdown will halt the review and approval of new grants. The

              </p>
              <p>
                The US National Science Foundation (NSF), expects to halt work
                for 1,487 out of its 1,946 employees, once short-term funding
                runs out, for example. Scientists can continue to submit
                applications for funding to the agency, which pays for about
                one-quarter of the taxpayer-supported basic research in the
                United States, but no new projects will be approved. The
                Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the US
                National Institutes of Health, a significant funder of
                biomedical research, plans to furlough some 37,325 people — 42%
                of its staff — by the second day of a shutdown. 'Essential'
                staff working at its clinical centre or on public-safety
                missions such as monitoring for viral outbreaks will continue to
                report to work.

                states that many clinical trials supported by the National
                Institutes of Health (NIH) will be affected:

                    NIH was mostly spared in the last shutdown because its
                    budget had already been approved by Congress, but this time
                    it will feel the impact. A subset of its nearly 19,800
                    employees—just 4427, or 22%—will remain on duty to care for
                    patients at the NIH Clinical Center and maintain research
                    animals and cell lines for labs in the agency's intramural
                    research program. No new patients will be enrolled in trials
                    unless their illness is life threatening. The agency also
                    expects to keep open PubMed, which holds biomedical research
                    abstracts needed for health care, and the ClinicalTrials.gov
                    registry, where reporting of clinical studies is a legal
                    requirement.

                However, the <i>Science</i> article notes that some astronomy
                research will continue to be conducted during the shutdown due
                to leftover funds from the current fiscal year or other external
                funding:

                    As for research infrastructure that NSF supports, a small
                    number of employees deemed essential will continue to
                    provide support for research programs in the Arctic and

                    remain open for an extended period thanks to extra funding
                    the agency provided this year to tide them over in case of a
                    shutdown. Most of the optical telescopes are managed for NSF
                    by a nongovernmental organization, the Association of
                    Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). It has
                    "sufficient financial resources to maintain our functional
                    and research activities for a reasonable length of time," an
                    AURA spokesperson told ScienceInsider.

                    university coalition, "We are doing exactly nothing special
                    to prepare for the shutdown," Director Tony Beasley says.
                    That contrasts with the government shutdown of 2013, when
                    NRAO was forced to switch off its U.S.-based facilities
                    after just a few days.

                Other agencies will continue to provide services that are deemed
                essential but will cease other operations. For example,

                  and warnings</a
                >
                but research to improve weather forecasts will be halted during
                a shutdown. As in the 2019 government shutdown,
                <a
                  href="https://www.npr.org/2019/01/18/686451007/how-the-government-shutdown-is-affecting-weather-forecasts"

                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                In summary, the looming government shutdown will not halt
                science-related activities that are deemed necessary to
                imminently protecting life and property, such as issuing weather
                warnings. However, the employees who provide those services will
                not get paid until after the government shutdown ends. For
                agencies that do not have supplemental funds available,
                scientific research will generally be halted.

                  <p>Bing Chat responses infiltrated by ads pushing malware</p>
                  <p>
                    Malicious advertisements are now being injected into
                    Microsoft's AI-powered Bing Chat responses, promoting fake
                    download sites that distribute malware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bing Chat, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 engine, was introduced
                    by Microsoft in February 2023 to challenge Google's
                    dominance in the search industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By offering users an interactive chat-based experience
                    instead of the traditional search query and result format,
                    Bing Chat aimed to make online searches more intuitive and
                    user-friendly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In March, Microsoft began injecting ads into Bing Chat
                    conversations to generate revenue from this new platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, incorporating ads into Bing Chat has opened the
                    door to threat actors, who
                    <a
                      href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-access-brokers-use-google-ads-to-breach-your-network/"
                      >increasingly take</a
                    >
                    out
                    <a
                      href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-abuse-google-ads-to-spread-malware-in-legit-software/"
                      >search advertisements to distribute malware</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, conversing with AI-powered chat tools can
                    instill unwarranted trust, potentially convincing users to
                    click on ads, which isn't the case when skimming through
                    impersonal search results.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This conversation-like interaction can imbue AI-provided
                    URLs with a misplaced sense of authority and
                    trustworthiness, so the existing problem of malvertizing in
                    search platforms is amplified by the introduction of AI
                    assistants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fact that these ads are labeled as promoted results when
                    the user hovers over a link in Bing Chat conversations is
                    likely too weak of a measure to mitigate the risk.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The display of malvertising within Bing Chat
                    conversations highlights the expanding frontier of cyber
                    threats and makes it crucial for users to be wary of chatbot
                    results and always double-check URLs before downloading
                    anything.

                    The company announced the change in an email sent to
                    Canadian subscribers. Disney has not provided many details
                    on how it plans to enforce this policy — its email merely
                    states that "we're implementing restrictions on your ability
                    to share your account or login credentials outside of your
                    household." The announcement reads more like a strong finger
                    wag than anything else. "You may not share your subscription
                    outside of your household," reads the company's updated Help

                    "significant" number of people are currently sharing
                    passwords across Disney's services and added that Disney has

                    Disney Plus is just the latest streaming service to attempt
                    to tackle password sharing. Netflix has been testing such

                      >May 2023</a
                    >. Netflix accounts are restricted based on a user's IP
                    address; subscribers, depending on the plan they select,
                    have the option of adding additional members to their
                    accounts for an additional fee. The company said in its Q2
                    earnings call that its policy has driven more subscribers to
                    the service.

                    But hey, if it's any consolation: Canadian users now have
                    access to the cheaper ad-supported tier. This next turn in
                    the streaming wars is going to get pricey.

                    and route their attack(s) through Cloudflare's

                    The consulting firm has published a proof-of-concept (PoC)
                    demonstration of these issues and recommends the use of
                    custom certificates for connection authentication and the
                    use of Cloudflare Aegis to mitigate the gaps.

                    as 'informative' and closed without a fix. A Cloudflare

                    Over her three decades in the Senate, Feinstein transformed
                    from a barrier-breaking member of the Democratic Party's
                    liberal vanguard, championing the legalization of same-sex
                    marriage and a ban on assault-style weapons, to one of the
                    Washington's establishment members, esteemed by lawmakers on
                    both sides of the aisle but increasingly criticized by
                    outside progressives who argued that she refused to step
                    aside for the next generation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In her final years, her work on Capitol Hill had also begun
                    to be overshadowed by concern
                    <a
                      href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dianne-feinstein-suffered-brain-inflammation-complication-shingles-aide/story?id=99439726"

                    even as she insisted she remained a robust public servant,
                    despite her hospitalizations, reports of episodes of
                    confusion and other issues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In announcing earlier this year that she planned to retire
                    at the end of her latest term, in 2025, Feinstein said:
                    "Each of us was sent here to solve problems. That's what
                    I've done for the last 30 years, and that's what I plan to
                    do for the next two years. My thanks to the people of
                    California for allowing me to serve them."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fellow Democrat, will now
                    appoint someone to serve out the remainder of Feinstein's
                    term, ahead of the 2024 race to succeed her. He has
                    committed to naming a Black woman -- who would then be only
                    the third such senator in history -- but has also said he
                    will not pick any of the candidates in the current
                    Democratic primary race, which includes Rep. Barbara Lee.

                    a significant update to ChatGPT that enables its GPT-3.5 and
                    GPT-4 AI models to analyze images and react to them as part
                    of a text conversation. Also, the ChatGPT mobile app will
                    add speech synthesis options that, when paired with its
                    existing speech recognition features, will enable fully
                    verbal conversations with the AI assistant, OpenAI says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    OpenAI is planning to roll out these features in ChatGPT to
                    Plus and Enterprise subscribers "over the next two weeks."
                    It also notes that speech synthesis is coming to iOS and
                    Android only, and image recognition will be available on
                    both the web interface and the mobile apps.<br />[...]<br />Despite
                    their drawbacks, in marketing materials, OpenAI is billing
                    these new features as giving ChatGPT the ability to "see,
                    hear, and speak." Not everyone is happy about the
                    anthropomorphism and potential hype language involved. On X,
                    Hugging Face AI researcher Dr. Sasha Luccioni
                    <a
                      href="https://x.com/SashaMTL/status/1706302354528555283?s=20"
                      >posted</a
                    >, "The always and forever PSA: stop treating AI models like
                    humans. No, ChatGPT cannot 'see, hear and speak.' It can be
                    integrated with sensors that will feed it information in
                    different modalities."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While ChatGPT and its associated AI models are clearly not
                    human—and hype is a very real thing in marketing—if the
                    updates perform as shown, they potentially represent a
                    significant expansion in capabilities for OpenAI's computer
                    assistant.

                    At CERN, an experiment investigated how gravity acts on
                    antimatter. General relativity predicts that all matter
                    follows gravitational attraction. However, recent decades in
                    cosmology raised enough questions about our understanding of
                    gravity. So, investigating the behavior of exotic matter is
                    necessary to confirm predictions from general relativity.
                    Antimatter has been available for quite a while; the first
                    positrons were created in 1932. Yet, measuring the effect of
                    gravity on charged particles is very difficult.
                    Gravitational force is much weaker than electromagnetic
                    force. The research team used anti-hydrogen (electrically
                    neutral) to observe the effect of gravity. And yes,
                    antihydrogen falls down.

                Amazon is limiting the number of books that authors can
                self-publish on its site to three a day, after an influx of
                suspected AI-generated material was listed for sale in recent
                months.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    The post stated that Amazon is "actively monitoring the
                    rapid evolution of generative AI and the impact it is having
                    on reading, writing, and publishing" and that "very few"
                    publishers will be affected by the change. Authors and
                    publishers will also have the option to seek an exception to
                    the rule.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rule change will "probably not" be a "gamechanger for
                    managing the influx of AI-written content on Amazon's
                    platform," said Dr Miriam Johnson, senior lecturer in
                    publishing at Oxford Brookes University. "It will dent the
                    numbers a bit, but for those who are making money by
                    flooding the market with AI-generated books and publishing
                    more than three a day, they will find a work-around."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The new sets of rules come after Amazon removed
                    suspected AI-generated books that were falsely listed as
                    being written by the author Jane Friedman. Earlier this
                    month, books about mushroom foraging listed on Amazon were
                    reported as likely to have been AI-generated and therefore
                    containing potentially dangerous advice. AI-generated travel
                    books have also flooded the site.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I'm glad to see Amazon taking these sensible, incremental
                    steps, and I hope they are prepared to do more as needed,"
                    said Friedman of the three-book rule. "AI-generated material
                    is unlikely to disappear any time soon given the numerous
                    courses now being promoted to people seeking to make easy
                    profits from selling AI-generated material – much of it
                    low-quality and some of it even fraudulent, as I
                    experienced."

                    The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has closed the
                    investigation into a mishap that occurred last September
                    during a launch of Blue Origin's New Shepard vehicle, with
                    the regulator saying that Blue must implement 21 corrective
                    actions before it can fly New Shepard again.
                  </p>

                    >
                    about a minute after liftoff. The vehicle's capsule, which
                    was not filled with people, had to conduct an emergency
                    parachute landing to clear the booster. It landed safely
                    while the propulsion module was destroyed on impact with the
                    ground. There were no injuries to Blue Origin personnel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an emailed statement, a representative for the FAA said
                    the anomaly was caused by a "structural failure of an engine
                    nozzle caused by higher than expected engine operating
                    temperatures." Among the 21 corrective actions includes
                    redesigning the engine and nozzle components as well as
                    "organizational changes."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In response to TechCrunch's inquiries into the corrective
                    actions, a Blue Origin spokesperson simply said,
                    "We've received the FAA's letter and plan to fly soon."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The closure of the mishap investigation does not mean that
                    Blue Origin can immediately start flying New Shepard. The
                    company must implement all the corrective actions and
                    receive a launch license modification from the FAA first,
                    the FAA spokesperson said.

                    "structural relief" that would be "necessary to redress and

                    Structural relief could involve breaking up the company.

                    In the last days of the 1400s, a terrible epidemic swept
                    through Europe. Men and women spiked sudden fevers. Their
                    joints ached, and they broke out in rashes that ripened into
                    bursting boils. Ulcers ate away at their faces, collapsing
                    their noses and jaws, working down their throats and
                    airways, making it impossible to eat or drink. Survivors
                    were grossly disfigured. Unluckier victims died.

                    Italy, on to Switzerland and Germany, and north to the
                    British Isles, Scandinavia, and Russia. The Holy Roman
                    Emperor declared it a punishment from God. “Nothing could be
                    more serious than this curse, this barbarian poison,” an
                    Italian historian wrote in 1495.

                    It seemed plausible that the great pox, later called
                    syphilis, might have journeyed with Spanish mercenaries, who
                    represented much of the army of Naples when France attacked
                    that kingdom in 1495. And it might have arrived in Spain
                    with the crews of Christopher Columbus, who returned there
                    in 1493 from the first of his exploratory voyages.

                  <p>
                    For most of the centuries since, a significant historical
                    narrative has blamed Columbus and his sailors for bringing
                    syphilis to Europe. It arrived as a ravaging plague and then
                    adapted to become a long-simmering disease that, before the
                    discovery of penicillin, could cripple people and drive them
                    mad. Investigating what’s called the “<a

                    >” has proved challenging: The symptoms related in old
                    accounts could describe several diseases, and the bacterium
                    that causes it, <i>Treponema pallidum</i>, was not
                    identified until 1905.

                    Provence in the 7th or 8th century. It’s the best evidence
                    yet that syphilis—or something related to it—was infecting
                    Europeans centuries before Columbus sailed.

                    work published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. “So
                    far, this was a hypothesis in science and the medical
                    literature, without any strong proof.”

                    GPUs from all six of the major suppliers are vulnerable to a
                    newly discovered attack that allows malicious websites to
                    read the usernames, passwords, and other sensitive visual
                    data displayed by other websites, researchers have
                    demonstrated in a paper published Tuesday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cross-origin attack allows a malicious website from one
                    domain—say, example.com—to effectively read the pixels
                    displayed by a website from example.org, or another
                    different domain. Attackers can then reconstruct them in a
                    way that allows them to view the words or images displayed
                    by the latter site. This leakage violates a critical
                    security principle that forms one of the most fundamental
                    security boundaries safeguarding the Internet. Known as the
                    <a
                      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy"
                      >same origin policy</a
                    >, it mandates that content hosted on one website domain be
                    isolated from all other website domains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    GPU.zip, as the proof-of-concept attack has been named,
                    starts with a malicious website that places a link to the
                    webpage it wants to read inside of an
                    <a

                      >iframe</a
                    >, a common HTML element that allows sites to embed ads,
                    images, or other content hosted on other websites. Normally,
                    the same origin policy prevents either site from inspecting
                    the source code, content, or final visual product of the
                    other. The researchers found that data compression that both
                    internal and discrete GPUs use to improve performance acts
                    as a

                    "Even if Unity were to walk back entirely on their

                    that Unity ignored advice from the development community
                    before announcing their initial plans earlier this month.

                    [...] For their first generation of LPCAMM modules, Samsung
                    is looking as capacities of 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB, with data
                    rates up to LPDDR5X-7500. Samsung doesn’t currently have any
                    256Gbit LPDDR5X memory modules in their
                    <a
                      href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/dram/lpddr/lpddr5x/"
                      >catalog</a
                    >, so either the company has a way to fit 8 modules on to an
                    LPCAMM, or more likely they intend to introduce larger
                    memory modules by the time LPCAMMs ship next year. Otherwise
                    the data rate is a tier below Samsung’s best memory modules
                    (8533 MT/sec), but I wouldn’t be surprised to eventually
                    find out that it’s the trade-off for having modular LPDDR
                    memory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Samsung, they’ve already verified their LPCAMMs
                    with an unnamed Intel platform – almost certainly Raptor
                    Lake mobile, given the timing of the announcement. Though
                    nothing about LPCAMMs is vendor-specific, and if the form
                    factor is successful, I wouldn’t be surprised to see laptop
                    manufacturers also pick it up for AMD designs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For the moment, Samsung isn’t saying how LPCAMM
                    compares to soldered LPDDR5X memory with regards to size or
                    performance – it bigger and almost certainly a bit more
                    power hungry due to trace lengths. Otherwise, as a
                    replacement for SO-DIMMs, Samsung says that LPDDR5X LPCAMMs
                    only occupy 40% of the space of a DDR5 SO-DIMM, and improve
                    power efficiency by up to 70%, roughly in line with the
                    general benefit of LPDDR5X over LPDDR5.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But even with this newfound flexibility, don’t expect to see
                    LPCAMMs replace soldered LPDDR memory – at least not
                    wholesale. Besides the higher qualified speeds for a
                    soldered solution, LPCAMMs can’t match the smaller footprint
                    of a soldered solution, especially as vendors are starting
                    to put LPDDR memory directly on chip packages (i.e. Apple).
                    Depending on the cost of implementation, LPCAMMs may
                    displace soldered-on-motherboard memory, while ultraportable
                    devices will increasingly embrace soldered-on-package memory
                    to maximize space and efficiency.

                    Scientists said on Tuesday they have found the "missing
                    ingredient" for pink diamonds, some of the world's most
                    expensive stones due their rarity and beauty, and the
                    discovery could help find more.

                  <p>
                    More than 90 percent of all the pink diamonds ever found
                    were discovered at the recently closed Argyle mine in the
                    remote northwest of Australia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But exactly why Argyle—which unlike most other diamond mines
                    does not sit in the middle of a continent but on the edge of
                    one—produced so many pink gems has remained a mystery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new study published in the journal
                    <i>Nature Communications</i>, a team of Australia-based
                    researchers said the pink diamonds were brought to the
                    Earth's surface by the break up of the first supercontinent
                    around 1.3 billion years ago.

                    state of Western Australia and the study's lead author, told
                    AFP that two of the three ingredients for forming pink
                    diamonds had already been known.

                Microsoft wants to become a nuclear power. Their need for power
                to power their AI and other things is now so great that they
                want to run their own nuclear reactors.

                    Nuclear energy doesn't create greenhouse gas emissions. Even
                    so, it could also open up a whole new can of worms when it
                    comes to handling radioactive waste and building up a
                    uranium supply chain. The role nuclear energy ought to play
                    in combatting climate change is still hotly debated, but
                    Microsoft co-founder, Bill Gates, has long been a big fan of
                    the technology.

                    Based on the new job listing, it looks like Microsoft is
                    betting on advanced nuclear reactors to be the answer. The
                    job posting says it's hiring someone to "lead project
                    initiatives for all aspects of nuclear energy infrastructure
                    for global growth."

              <p>
                Most of our light pollution comes from sources on the ground,
                but satellites don't just spoil deep-space astronomical
                observations when they cross a telescope's field of view; they
                also scatter and reflect sunlight from their solar arrays. The
                abundance of satellites is causing the overall brightness of the
                sky to increase all around the globe. Some researchers have
                estimated that, on average, our darkest night skies, located in
                the most remote regions of the world, are 10% brighter than they
                were a half century ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                Humans are ineffably impacted. How can someone who has never
                seen a clear night sky know what they are missing? It's like
                someone without gonads or genital nerves trying to understand
                orgasm.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many animal species are suffering as well. What good are
                night-adapted senses in nocturnal species if the night sky isn't
                much darker than the daytime sky? Researchers have identified
                several species whose circadian rhythms are getting thrown off,
                making them vulnerable to predation (or, the reverse: the
                inability to effectively locate prey).

                <div>
                  <p>
                    Amazon announced today that Prime Video users in the US,
                    Canada, Germany, and the UK will automatically start seeing
                    advertisements "in early 2024." Subscribers will receive a
                    notification email "several weeks" in advance, at which
                    point they can opt to pay $2.99 extra for ad-free Prime
                    Video, Amazon said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That takes the price of ad-free Prime Video from $8.99/month
                    alone to $11.98/month and from $14.99/month with Prime to
                    $17.98/month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Prime Video subscribers who don't pay the extra $2.99
                    (and don't just cancel their subscription altogether) are
                    promised "meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other
                    streaming TV providers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] With current prices starting at $9.99 per month, Prime
                    Video was one of the cheapest ways to get streaming TV
                    without ads. While the changes put pricing for ad-free Prime
                    Video more on par with its competitors, it may still
                    disappoint budget-minded cord-cutters.

                    >
                    as a cheaper, simpler alternative to cable TV. But as an
                    influx in services, changes in pricing, confusing bundles,
                    and scattered content have proven, we haven't gotten that
                    far from cable after all.

                    The dreaded rat lungworm—a parasite with a penchant for rats
                    and slugs that occasionally finds itself rambling and
                    writhing in human brains—has firmly established itself in
                    the Southeast US and will likely continue its rapid
                    invasion,
                    <a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study involved small-scale surveillance of dead rats in
                    the Atlanta zoo. Between 2019 and 2022, researchers
                    continually turned up evidence of the worm. In all, the
                    study identified seven out of 33 collected rats (21 percent)
                    with evidence of a rat lungworm infection. The infected
                    animals were spread throughout the study's time frame, all
                    in different months, with one in 2019, three in 2021, and
                    three in 2022, indicating sustained transmission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although small, the study "suggests that the zoonotic
                    parasite was introduced to and has become established in a
                    new area of the southeastern United States," the study's
                    authors, led by researchers at the University of Georgia
                    College of Veterinary Medicine, concluded. The study was
                    published Wednesday in the journal Emerging Infectious
                    Diseases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When a rat lungworm finds itself in a human, it does
                    what it usually does in rats—it heads to the central nervous
                    system and brain. Sometimes the migration of the worms to
                    the central nervous system is asymptomatic or only causes
                    mild transient symptoms. But, sometimes, they cause severe
                    neurological dysfunction. This can start with nonspecific
                    symptoms like headache, light sensitivity, and insomnia and
                    develop into neck stiffness and pain, tingling or burning of
                    the skin, double vision, bowel or bladder difficulties, and
                    seizures. In severe cases, it can cause nerve damage,
                    paralysis, coma, and even death.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's often thought that the worm can't complete its life
                    cycle in humans and that it ends up idly

                    >
                    before it's eventually killed off by immune responses.
                    However, there has been some evidence of adult worms
                    reaching the human lungs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Regardless, there's no specific treatment for a rat lungworm
                    infection. No anti-parasitic drugs have proven effective,
                    and, in fact, there's some evidence they can make symptoms
                    worse by spurring more immune responses to dying worms. For
                    now, supportive treatment, pain medications, and steroids
                    are typically the only options.

                The BBC reports that Lego won't be making blocks from recycled

                It appears they did a full depth study over the last two years,

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Currently, many of Lego's bricks are made using
                    acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a virgin plastic made
                    from crude oil.<br />...<br />In 2021, it said it has
                    developed prototype bricks made from polyethylene
                    terephthalate (PET) bottles, with some other chemicals
                    added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The hope was that material could have offered an alternative
                    to oil-based bricks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Lego has now revealed that after more than two years of
                    testing, it had found that using recycled PET didn't reduce
                    carbon emissions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It said the reason for that was because extra steps were
                    required in the production process, which meant it needed to
                    use more energy.

                      * Good for Lego to come clean and not continue with
                "greenwashing".<br />
                      * What's wrong with wooden blocks anyway? I really enjoyed
                mine. They didn't lock me into a fixed attachment the way that
                Lego does. Don't be square (aka boring)!

                    will have to pay the charges, the company says.

                    that was set up in 2019 to help developers track Terms of
                    Service changes and reinstated its commitment that "you can

                    [...] Under the newly announced plan, runtime fees will not
                    apply to any projects made on the Unity Personal tier, which
                    will remain completely free. In addition, Unity Personal
                    projects will now be able to stay on that free tier until
                    the developer behind them makes $200,000 in annual revenue,
                    an increase from the previous $100,000 revenue cap. And
                    Personal tier projects will no longer be required to put a
                    "Made with Unity" splash screen at the start of play.

                  <p>
                    In addition, Unity now says the new runtime fees will only
                    be incurred for projects that have reached $1 million in
                    revenue in the last 12 months and 1 million "initial
                    engagements" in their lifetime.

                    GWASs are a crucial tool in science, but they have their
                    limitations. Importantly, they can only find correlations
                    between a variant and a disease or trait. So more research
                    will be needed to confirm a causal relationship between this
                    newly discovered mutation and Parkinson’s and to learn how
                    it might be causing the disease. But GWASs are often
                    intended to provide scientists with new clues to track down.
                    And the authors say their research offers a clear example of
                    why it’s so important to include a wide array of people in
                    these studies.

                    flea biology enabled us to pioneer a nature-inspired
                    tertiary wastewater treatment technology. This refines

                    "The water flea's remarkable ability to remain dormant for
                    centuries allows scientists to revive dormant populations
                    that endured varying historical pollution pressures.
                    Leveraging this trait, researchers sourced strains with
                    diverse tolerances to chemical pollutants, incorporating
                    them into the technology."

                    Engineering, University of Birmingham, said, "We introduced
                    these remarkable water fleas into custom containment devices
                    to refine effluent before its final release. Once in place,
                    our technology largely maintains itself, attributed to the
                    water fleas' clonal reproduction capability."

                    Lead author and University of Birmingham Ph.D. student
                    Muhammad Abdullahi added, "This novel nature-inspired
                    technology provides a potentially revolutionary process for
                    sustainably removing persistent chemical pollutants from
                    wastewater. By preventing these chemicals from being
                    discharged, we can protect our environment and
                    biodiversity."

                    Back in the late 1970s, the most popular memory chip was
                    Mostek's MK4116, holding a whopping (for the time) 16
                    kilobits. It provided storage for computers such as the
                    Apple II, TRS-80, ZX Spectrum, Commodore PET, IBM PC, and
                    Xerox Alto as well as video games such as Defender and
                    Missile Command. To see how the chip is implemented I opened
                    one up and reverse-engineered it. I expected the circuitry
                    to be similar to other chips of the era, using standard NMOS
                    gates, but it was much more complex than I expected, built
                    from low-power dynamic logic. The MK4116 also used advanced
                    manufacturing processes to fit 16,384 high-density memory
                    cells on the chip.
                  </p>

                    [...] In dynamic RAM, each bit is stored in a capacitor with
                    the bit's value, 0 or 1, represented by the voltage on the
                    capacitor.3 The advantage of dynamic RAM is that each memory
                    cell is very small, so a lot of data can be stored on one
                    chip.4 The downside of dynamic RAM is that the charge on a
                    capacitor leaks away after a few milliseconds. To avoid
                    losing data, dynamic RAM must be constantly refreshed: bits
                    are read from the capacitors, amplified, and then written
                    back to the capacitors. For the MK4116, all the data must be
                    refreshed every two milliseconds.

                    Daily insulin injections are painful and inconvenient, which
                    is why scientists are developing
                    <a

                    without any need for needles. A new one looks particularly
                    promising, as it produces oxygen to feed onboard islet
                    cells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] One alternative to those injections involves
                    implanting islet cells that have either been harvested from
                    a cadaver or derived from stem cells. While doing so does
                    work in many cases, patients have to take immunosuppressive
                    drugs for the rest of their lives in order to keep those
                    cells from being rejected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists have tried encapsulating islet cells in tiny
                    flexible implants that shield the cells from the host's
                    immune system, yet still allow insulin produced by those
                    cells to diffuse into the bloodstream. These implants also
                    prevent life-sustaining oxygen from reaching the cells,
                    however, which means those cells won't last long.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some implants have addressed that shortcoming by
                    incorporating either a preloaded oxygen chamber or chemical
                    reagents which produce oxygen. Both the oxygen and the
                    reagents run out over time, though, so the implants will
                    have to be replaced or refilled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Seeking a longer-term alternative, a team from MIT and
                    Boston Children's Hospital recently developed the new
                    device.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's packed with hundreds of thousands of islet cells, along
                    with a proton-exchange membrane that splits water vapor
                    (which occurs naturally in the body) into hydrogen and
                    oxygen. The hydrogen harmlessly diffuses, while the oxygen
                    goes into a storage chamber in the implant. A thin,
                    permeable membrane in that chamber then allows the oxygen to
                    flow through to the chamber containing the islet cells.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We spoke to over 500 residents across parts of Oakland that
                    have been especially hard hit by crime and violence and who
                    live in areas that have historically been both overpoliced
                    and underserved with public resources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We asked questions like, "What does safety or the lack of
                    safety look like here," and "What are some signs that the
                    community is doing well or not doing well?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These conversations covered a lot of ground—ground that was
                    similar to other conversations we've had about peace with
                    people who live in conflict zones or countries with long
                    histories of war.

                  <p>
                    Some Oakland residents spoke about how kids are desensitized
                    to gunshots and violence or are arrested or kicked out of
                    their homes. We heard that these kids and teenagers
                    ultimately lose sight of how their lives—and the lives of
                    others—have value.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    High school students also reflected on the prevalence of
                    guns, shootings and gangs in their lives. As one told us, "I

                    But just as we know that violence and security are only two
                    aspects of people's understandings of peace, the same is
                    true of safety. The police—and even crime—are just two
                    aspects of how communities think about safety in their
                    everyday lives. They also think about economic
                    opportunities, public space and social connections.

                    We heard about how, when kids have basic life skills and job
                    skills training, or have mentors and role models, this can
                    give them choices that are alternatives to criminal activity
                    and help them invest back in their communities.

                Neuralink are looking for a few test subjects that have either
                ALS or are quadriplegics to test their wireless brain human
                interface. A device that will control a computer keyboard with
                only the users mind. Also they want to test out how good their
                robot is at surgery but that is perhaps less appealing.

                    The PRIME Study (short for Precise Robotically Implanted
                    Brain-Computer Interface) – a groundbreaking investigational
                    medical device trial for our fully-implantable, wireless
                    brain-computer interface (BCI) – aims to evaluate the safety
                    of our implant (N1) and surgical robot (R1) and assess the
                    initial functionality of our BCI for enabling people with
                    paralysis to control external devices with their thoughts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During the study, the R1 Robot will be used to surgically
                    place the N1 Implant's ultra-fine and flexible threads in a
                    region of the brain that controls movement intention. Once
                    in place, the N1 Implant is cosmetically invisible and is
                    intended to record and transmit brain signals wirelessly to
                    an app that decodes movement intention. The initial goal of
                    our BCI is to grant people the ability to control a computer
                    cursor or keyboard using their thoughts alone.

                    a preliminary injunction stopping California Attorney
                    General Rob Bonta from enforcing the state's Age-Appropriate
                    Design Code Act (CAADCA), finding that the law likely
                    violates the First Amendment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The Court finds that although the stated purpose of the
                    Act—protecting children when they are online—clearly is
                    important," Freeman wrote, "the CAADCA likely violates the
                    First Amendment."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Specifically," Freeman said, "the age estimation and
                    privacy provisions thus appear likely to impede the
                    'availability and use' of information and accordingly to
                    regulate speech," and "the steps a business would need to
                    take to sufficiently estimate the age of child users would
                    likely prevent both children and adults from accessing
                    certain content."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Regulators' attempts to age-gate the Internet have
                    drawn criticism, and courts have repeatedly found that these
                    laws likely run afoul of the First Amendment. But perhaps
                    more troubling, here, Freeman found that CAADCA not only
                    risked restricting speech, but also did not appear to
                    address or mitigate the harms to children identified by the
                    state. Even worse, after California argued that businesses
                    gathering information from children by requiring face scans
                    or other biometric data to estimate user ages was "minimally
                    invasive," Freeman concluded that enforcing the law could
                    cause more harm than good. "Such measures would appear to
                    counter the State's interest in increasing privacy
                    protections for children," Freeman wrote, explaining:
                  </p>

                      <p>
                        "CAADCA's age estimation provision appears not only
                        unlikely to materially alleviate the harm of
                        insufficient data and privacy protections for children,
                        but actually likely to exacerbate the problem by
                        inducing covered businesses to require consumers,
                        including children, to divulge additional personal

                into two "devices" under Microsoft DOS 3.2: 32MB and 8MB. It was
                so large that I thought that nobody would be able to use all
                that disk space! Over time, newest drives has had: 80MB, 200MB,
                and 1TB. My current PC has a 2TB drive... and that is relatively
                "small" by today's standards. Microsoft lost <i>38TB</i>?!]

              <p>How large were <i>your</i> drives over time?</p>

                Alex "Sandy" Pentland[1] is somewhere near the top of the AI
                pantheon these days, here's his most recent talk, "Engineering
                Ecosystems with AI", given online on Friday 15 Sept.,
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m8EsEmZPYQ"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m8EsEmZPYQ</a
                >
                at the MIT Mobility Forum. In the intro it is mentioned that
                this was a dry run for Pentland's upcoming keynote to the U. S.
                National Academy of Sciences. From the YT summary,
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    This talk covers how our society is having difficulties
                    engineering heterogeneous systems of people and
                    technologies; for instance, our systems for dealing with
                    pandemics, climate change, inequality, or financial stress
                    have been less than completely successful, in significant
                    part because of unanticipated human behaviors.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                He discusses recent work on models of panics, cascades and other
                highly nonlinear, long tailed phenomena--using aggregated census
                data--as an example of how AI and big data can be socially
                useful.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then he takes the data further, showing that when people move
                between communities (both locally and internationally with
                migration) is when progress really happens. AI may have a
                similar "melting pot" effect, helping mid-level workers/earners
                (which he defines) in closing some of the
                performance/creativity/earnings gap to high-level workers. In
                particular, AI developed on restricted and well defined training
                sets may not get the headlines of ChatGPT, but will be very
                useful in many fields.
              </p>
              <p>
                Near the end he quotes Xi Jinping of China to make it clear how
                big this social change is going to be (paraphrased):
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Xi is the largest representative, loudest voice for Marxism
                    and he recently said, 'data is a new primary means of
                    production along with capital and labor'. And if you think
                    about that, what he's saying is that classic Marxism is
                    done. It's now not a battle between capital and labor. It's
                    a battle between data, capital and labor and that sort of
                    gives you a sense of the magnitude of this problem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you look at what society did with capital and labor, it
                    took a century or more, for instance, to form labor unions
                    to pressure companies, to establish principles to get laws
                    enacted. ... And it's not a fixed thing, it's not like you
                    can do it once and it's done. It evolves over time. So
                    currently we're in a new evolutionary phase of labor and a
                    new evolutionary phase of capital. The problem with data is
                    that we don't have *any* institutions, we don't have *any*
                    norms for it. It's new, so we're back in the robber baron
                    era of capital, we're back in the early industrial age where
                    kids were working 14 hour days. That's where we are with
                    data. Just face it! What we have to do is develop the right
                    institutions to be able to deal with this now-critical
                    element of society.

                I don't watch many videos, but this one was well worth the time.
                His actual talk is about 25 minutes, the rest of the hour is
                intro and many questions/discussions at the end.

                    TSMC is in talks with Arizona officials to build its chip
                    packaging facility in the state, Katie Hobbs, governor of
                    Arizona, said in Taipei after visiting the world's No.1
                    foundry's headquarters, reports

                      >Bloomberg</a

                    vertically integrated chip production chain in the USA for
                    the first time ever.

                    TSMC has built Fab 21 in Arizona and is currently installing
                    production tools there. The company is also building up the
                    second phase of the fab and has approved plans to invest $40
                    billion in these two production facilities. But the company
                    apparently does not want to stop there and is discussing the
                    possibility of building an advanced packaging fab in the
                    state, too, as this will help it to assemble complex
                    system-in-packages for its clients from the U.S. on American
                    soil.

                    goes through a lot of the now-familiar arguments for why
                    Unity's decision to charge up to $0.20 per game install will
                    be bad for the industry. The federation of 23 national game
                    developer trade associations argues that the new fee
                    structure will make it "much harder for [small and midsize
                    developers] to build reliable business plans" by
                    "significantly increas[ing] the game development costs for
                    most game developers relying on [Unity's] services."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Beyond simply being bad for the industry, though, the
                    EGDF argues that "Unity's move might be anti-competitive" in
                    a way that demands government action. The group takes a
                    special exception to Unity's history of bundling its game
                    engine with services like analytics, in-game chat, ad
                    networks and mediation tools, user acquisition tools, and
                    more. That kind of bundling creates "a significant vendor
                    lock risk for game developers using Unity services," which
                    "also makes it difficult for many game middleware developers
                    to compete against Unity."

                  <p>
                    Some 500 years ago, construction workers in the midst of
                    building Ćmielów Castle in Poland carved a simple game board
                    into a slab of the sandstone floor as a diversion for their
                    leisure time. At least that's one possible scenario for the
                    existence of a game board recently discovered by
                    archaeologists in the castle ruins; it's also possible the
                    board could have been carved by children or by servants
                    after the castle was completed, or it may have been meant as
                    a symbolic message.
                  </p>

                      >previously reported</a
                    >, there is archaeological evidence for various kinds of
                    board games from all over the world dating back millennia:
                    Senet and Mehen in ancient Egypt, for example, or a strategy
                    game called ludus latrunculorum ("game of mercenaries")
                    favored by Roman legions. A 4,000-year-old board discovered
                    last year at an archaeological site in Oman's Qumayrah
                    Valley might be a precursor to an ancient Middle Eastern
                    game known as the Royal Game of Ur (or the Game of Twenty
                    Squares), a two-player game that may have been one of the
                    precursors to backgammon (or was simply replaced in
                    popularity by backgammon). Like backgammon, it's essentially
                    a race game in which players compete to see who can move all
                    their pieces along the board before their opponent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This latest discovery isn't quite as old as that in terms of
                    the actual carved board, but the game could be just as
                    ancient. According to archaeologist Tomasz Olszacki, it's a
                    two-person strategy board game called Mill, also known as
                    Nine Men's Morris, Merels, or "cowboy checkers" in North
                    America. The earliest-known Mill game board was found carved
                    into the roofing slabs of an Egyptian temple at Kurna, which
                    likely predates the Common Era. Historians believe it was
                    well-known to the Romans, who may have learned of the game
                    through trade routes.

                        One of the threats this emerging technology poses is to
                        weaken current encryption schemes, allowing protected

                        the concern is that encrypted communications can be

                    <b>Significance</b>:<br />
                    A consistent and comprehensive quantitative framework of the
                    cells in the human body could benefit many areas of biology.
                    We compile data to estimate cell mass, size range, and cell
                    count for some 1,200 cell groups, from the smallest red
                    blood cells to the largest muscle fibers, across 60 tissues
                    in a representative male, female, and 10-y-old child. We
                    find large-scale patterns revealing that both cellular
                    biomass in any given logarithmic cell-size class and the
                    coefficient of cell-size variation are both approximately
                    independent of cell size. These patterns are suggestive of a
                    whole-organism trade-off between cell size and count and
                    imply the existence of cell-size homeostasis across cell
                    types.

                    <b>Abstract</b>:<br />
                    Cell size and cell count are adaptively regulated and
                    intimately linked to growth and function. Yet, despite their
                    widespread relevance, the relation between cell size and
                    count has never been formally examined over the whole human
                    body. Here, we compile a comprehensive dataset of cell size
                    and count over all major cell types, with data drawn from
                    &gt;1,500 published sources. We consider the body of a
                    representative male (70 kg), which allows further estimates
                    of a female (60 kg) and 10-y-old child (32 kg). We build a
                    hierarchical interface for the cellular organization of the
                    body, giving easy access to data, methods, and sources (<a
                      href="https://humancelltreemap.mis.mpg.de/"
                      >https://humancelltreemap.mis.mpg.de/</a
                    >). In total, we estimate total body counts of ≈36 trillion
                    cells in the male, ≈28 trillion in the female, and ≈17
                    trillion in the child. These data reveal a surprising
                    inverse relation between cell size and count, implying a
                    trade-off between these variables, such that all cells
                    within a given logarithmic size class contribute an equal
                    fraction to the body's total cellular biomass. We also find
                    that the coefficient of variation is approximately
                    independent of mean cell size, implying the existence of
                    cell-size regulation across cell types. Our data serve to
                    establish a holistic quantitative framework for the cells of
                    the human body, and highlight large-scale patterns in cell
                    biology.

                    [...] [Nhat-Minh] Nguyen, U-M physics professor Dragan
                    Huterer and U-M graduate student Yuewei Wen examined the
                    temporal growth of large-scale structure throughout cosmic
                    time using several cosmological probes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, the team used what's called the cosmic microwave
                    background. The cosmic microwave background, or CMB, is
                    composed of photons emitted just after the Big Bang. These
                    photons provide a snapshot of the very early universe. As
                    the photons travel to our telescopes, their path can become
                    distorted, or gravitationally lensed, by large-scale
                    structure along the way. Examining them, the researchers can
                    infer how structure and matter between us and the cosmic
                    microwave background are distributed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nguyen and colleagues took advantage of a similar phenomenon
                    with weak gravitational lensing of galaxy shapes. Light from
                    background galaxies is distorted through gravitational
                    interactions with foreground matter and galaxies. The
                    cosmologists then decode these distortions to determine how
                    the intervening matter is distributed.<br />[...] The
                    findings potentially address the so-called S8 tension in
                    cosmology. S8 is a parameter that describes the growth of
                    structure. The tension arises when scientists use two
                    different methods to determine the value of S8, and they do
                    not agree. The first method, using photons from the cosmic
                    microwave background, indicates a higher S8 value than the
                    value inferred from galaxy weak gravitational lensing and
                    galaxy clustering measurements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Neither of these probes measures the growth of structure
                    today. Instead, they probe structure at earlier times, then
                    extrapolate those measurements to present time, assuming the
                    standard model. Cosmic microwave background probes structure
                    in the early universe, while galaxy weak gravitational
                    lensing and clustering probe structure in the late universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers' findings of a late-time suppression of
                    growth would bring the two S8 values into perfect agreement,
                    according to Nguyen.
