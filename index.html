                LG Chem has developed a thin membrane said to greatly reduce the
                chance of fire in Li-Ion batteries. From the abstract,
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Integrating safety features to cut off excessive current
                    during accidental internal short circuits in Li-ion
                    batteries (LIBs) can reduce the risk of thermal runaway.
                    However, making this concept practical requires overcoming
                    challenges in both material development and scalable
                    manufacturing. Here, we demonstrate the roll-to-roll
                    production of a safety reinforced layer (SRL) on current
                    collectors at a rate of 5 km per day. The SRL, made of
                    molecularly engineered polythiophene (PTh) and carbon
                    additives, interrupts current flow during voltage drops or
                    overheating without adversely affecting battery performance.
                    Impact testing on 3.4-Ah pouch cells shows that the SRL
                    reduces battery explosions from 63% to 10%.

                    ... The only catch, now, is that testing has only truly
                    begun. Scaling up to larger capacity battery packs—ones used
                    in EVs, as highlighted by the study—are to begin in 2025. It
                    seems that the CTO of LG Chem, Lee Jong-gu, believes this
                    safety feature will come sooner rather than later: "This is
                    a tangible research achievement that can be applied to mass
                    production in a short period of time. We will enhance safety
                    technology to ensure customers can use electric vehicles
                    with confidence and contribute to strengthening our
                    competitiveness in the battery market." We're sure that many
                    firefighters and motorsports events are probably begging LG
                    Chem to make this technology a top priority.

                    Another key factor in whether people will be interested in
                    having satellite services available as a supplement is -
                    unsurprisingly - the quality of mobile network coverage in
                    their area.

                  <p>
                    [...] Many of these alliances are for space-borne services
                    that are not yet operational, of course, such as the tie-ups
                    between US networks Verizon and AT&amp;T to use the
                    satellite network that

                  <p>
                    Most of the telcos with satellite tie-ups are in the
                    Asia-Pacific region, double those found in the next largest
                    region, which is Sub-Saharan Africa. Europe is listed as
                    having 10, and North America six, with Latin America at 14,
                     Middle East and North Africa at eight, and Eurasia four.

                    remains the leader in deployments, the GSM said, with more
                    than 6,300 in orbit as of August 2024. However, it is
                    estimated that only around one hundred of these are
                    currently units supporting direct-to-cell capability.

                    Eutelsat OneWeb had the next highest number of deployments,
                    with approximately 650 units in orbit, while Amazon's

                    China also has plans to loft thousands of satellites in the
                    near future, and the GSMA notes that these are part of a
                    broader strategy to support defense and economic objectives
                    and largely for domestic use, in contrast to other network
                    operators such as Starlink.

                    Earlier sessions have traced how OceanGate first developed a
                    carbon-fiber hull for Titan that cracked during deep-sea
                    testing in the Bahamas in 2019, and then commissioned a
                    second hull that was used for dives to the Titanic starting
                    in 2021.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rest of today's hearing focused on the Coast Guard's
                    response after authorities learned that the sub had gone
                    missing a year ago. Capt. Jamie Frederick, who was one of
                    the leaders of the search effort and is now the commander of
                    Coast Guard Sector Boston, recapped the effort to find
                    Titan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Other highlights from the hearing:<br />OceanGate has
                    permanently wound down its operations, an attorney for the
                    company told the investigative board. "The company's primary
                    task has been to cooperate fully with the investigations
                    conducted by the Coast Guard and the NTSB, including in
                    connection with this public hearing," said the attorney,
                    Jane Shvets. "Our law firm, Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, was
                    engaged by OceanGate shortly after the tragedy to assist
                    with that process."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Just after the Titan sub implosion, OceanGate said it was
                    suspending all exploration and commercial operations, but
                    Shvets' comments made clear that the Everett-based company's
                    shutdown is permanent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Coast Guard doesn't have the resources needed for
                    conducting a subsurface search-and-rescue operation on its
                    own, said Scott Talbot, a search-and-rescue specialist at
                    the Coast Guard.."We only have the capability to do surface
                    search and rescue," Talbot told the board. He is part of a
                    team that reviewed the Titan case to determine how the Coast
                    Guard's capabilities could be improved.

                    "This is a field that, obviously, the DOD [Department of
                    Defense] is an expert in, but even they don't operate at
                    some of these depths that these commercial companies are
                    doing exploration at," Talbot said. "So to say the Coast
                    Guard is going to effect subsurface search and rescue at
                    these depths ... I don't see it happening."

                      Scientists announced on Thursday a milestone in
                      neurobiological research with the mapping of the entire
                      brain of an adult fruit fly, a feat that may provide
                      insight into brains across the animal kingdom, including
                      people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The research detailed more than 50 million connections
                      between more than 139,000 neurons - brain nerve cells - in
                      the insect, a species whose scientific name is Drosophila
                      melanogaster and is often used in neurobiological studies.
                      The research sought to decipher how brains are wired and
                      the signals underlying healthy brain functions. It also
                      could pave the way for mapping the brains of other
                      species.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      "You might be asking why we should care about the brain of
                      a fruit fly. My simple answer is that if we can truly
                      understand how any brain functions, it's bound to tell us
                      something about all brains," said Princeton University
                      professor of neuroscience and computer science Sebastian
                      Seung, one of the co-leaders of the work published in a
                      series of studies in the journal Nature
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      [...] "And flies are an important model system for
                      neurosciences. Their brains solve many of the same
                      problems we do... They're capable of sophisticated
                      behaviors like the execution of walking and flying,
                      learning and memory behaviors, navigation, feeding and
                      even social interactions, which is a behavior that we
                      studied in my lab at Princeton," Murthy added.

                    During the summer US Mobile announced it is now a “super
                    carrier”, offering the ability to connect to all three major
                    US cellular networks. There’s been a lot of confusion about
                    this new change and how it works. I’ve spent a few months
                    with the carrier getting to know it for that very reason. In
                    this short guide, we explain US Mobile carrier switching and
                    how it works, as well as if it’s as good as it sounds on
                    paper and who it’s best suited for.

                  <p>
                    [...] This process is basically like fully transferring to
                    another network. Though it’s possible to physically swap
                    SIMs for the transfer, an<a

                    >

                    is essential if you want this experience to be as simple and
                    painless as possible. Even then, it’s not exactly an instant
                    procedure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It’s a bit both, frankly. While it’s true that US
                    Mobile on paper might sound like it can seamlessly switch
                    between carriers anytime you need better coverage, the
                    reality is more mundane, tedious, and restricted than users
                    might assume initially. The answer to whether it is worth it
                    really depends on your needs. If you travel outside of your
                    home region at least once or twice a month on average and
                    have run into carrier issues, then yes this is a great deal.
                    It’s also nice having the piece of mind to be able to switch
                    anytime there’s extra congestion or a network outage, like
                    the big Verizon outage that recently was in the news.

                    First, they ignored direct instructions telling the officers
                    not to detain the driver. Then they kept him detained for 91
                    minutes which, if nothing else, definitely violates the
                    Supreme Court’s <em>Rodriguez</em> decision — the one that
                    says officers cannot prolong traffic stops without the
                    reasonable suspicion to do so.

                  <p>
                    The State Police officers didn’t have any of that. All they
                    had was a “no fly” hit that came coupled with instructions
                    stating that his mere presence on this list did not justify
                    further detention. And none of that justified the
                    warrantless search of his truck.

                    And, according to the allegations in the lawsuit, the
                    <em>only</em> reason Meshal was on the FBI’s “no fly” list
                    was because he had refused to become an FBI snitch.

                    travel plans. That a state officer would feel comfortable
                    detaining someone in contravention of direct instructions
                    otherwise makes it clear anyone the government merely wants
                    to <em>pretend</em> is a terrorist is justification enough
                    for any further violation of their rights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the district court level, all involved officers (Janufka,
                    Oglesby, and Wright) were denied qualified immunity for this
                    prolonged, suspicionless detention of Meshal, as well as for
                    the completely unjustified search of his vehicle. They
                    appealed. And the 11th Circuit says, too bad. Maybe don’t
                    violate rights if you don’t like being sued.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The court first cites the <em>Rodriguez</em> decision in
                    response to the officers’ arguments that the stop was not
                    “unreasonably” prolonged. It also addresses their claim that
                    detaining Meshal was necessary, even though the original
                    stop was (allegedly) for him following another driver too
                    closely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for the claim that it was the <em>FBI’s</em> fault the
                    detention took 90 minutes due to officers waiting for a
                    return call from the agency (after ignoring the agency’s
                    direct instructions not to detain the driver), the court is
                    even less sympathetic. An extended stop can’t be justified
                    just because officers chose to involve an outside agency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Driving the point home, the Appeals Court says all of this
                    is stuff officers should know — so clearly established they
                    can’t plausibly claim they weren’t “on notice” that
                    detaining someone on a no fly list (much less searching his
                    truck) for driving isn’t acceptable under the US
                    Constitution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit will continue. And rights that were always
                    present have been reaffirmed, something that’s going to help
                    plenty of people who have been placed on the FBI’s “no fly”
                    list (as this lawsuit alleges) for purely vindictive
                    reasons. I would expect the state of Georgia to settle soon,
                    rather than just wait around for more precedent curbing
                    officer misconduct to be solidified.

                    What is cyber resiliency? And why is it different than cyber
                    protection?<br />A prevention mindset means doing all you
                    can to keep the bad guys out. A resilience mindset adds a
                    layer: while you do all you can to prevent an attack, you
                    also work with the expectation that they still might break
                    through your defenses and invest heavily preparing to
                    respond and recover when the worst happens. Resilient
                    organizations specifically devote significant resources to
                    drawing up plans for what they will do if an attack happens,
                    designing processes to execute them when the time comes, and
                    practicing how to put these plans into action. Prevention is
                    critical — but it's not enough.<br />[...]<br />Yet in my
                    work as a researcher in conversation with chief information
                    security officers and other cyber experts, I have noticed
                    that many leaders focus most, if not all, of their security
                    resources on prevention and leave recovery to business
                    continuity plans that aren't usually designed with cyber
                    incidents in mind. Instead, leaders need to embrace a
                    mindset of cyber-resilience.

                The HBR readership is (I believe) tilted toward C-class
                executives, so this may well filter down into IT departments.
                Anyone here seen any signs of a push toward "resilience"
                recently?

                    of California, Berkeley environmental economist Rachel Young
                    and Stanford University economist Solomon Hsiang.

                  <p>
                    That’s a Mount Everest of an estimate compared to the
                    official number of deaths — 24 — that the National Oceanic
                    and Atmospheric Administration attributes
                    to the average storm in the team’s analysis. The
                    results suggest that “hurricanes and tropical storms are a
                    much greater public health concern than anyone previously
                    thought,” Young says. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using a statistical model, she and Hsiang analyzed the
                    impact of all 501 tropical cyclones that hit the contiguous
                    United States from 1930 to 2015. They measured changes in
                    mortality for up to 20 years after each of these storms.
                    Their analysis suggests that an individual hurricane may
                    indirectly lead to thousands of lives lost. And taken
                    together, the storms could have spurred as many as 5 percent
                    of all deaths over that time period. Infants were
                    particularly vulnerable, as were Black populations, the team
                    found. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Young and Hsiang don’t know all the ways hurricanes may
                    contribute to mortality, but they have some ideas. It’s
                    possible the stress of a surviving such a storm,
                    or the pollution left in the

                    local governments have less money to spend on health care
                    after rebuilding ravaged infrastructure. It could be some
                    combination of these and other factors, Young says. She’s
                    interested in digging into what’s going on.

                  <p>
                    In the meantime, Young thinks her team’s work highlights the
                    need for new disaster response polices — ones that account
                    for hurricanes’ impact long term. “We really pull together
                    after these disasters to help people immediately in the
                    aftermath,” she says. But “we need to be thinking about
                    these folks long after those initial responses are over.”

                    California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill that
                    requires automakers selling internet-connected cars to do
                    more to protect domestic abuse survivors, a move that may
                    expand such safeguards nationwide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As automakers add ever more sophisticated technology to
                    their cars, instances of stalking and harassment using
                    features such as location tracking and remote controls have
                    begun to emerge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The bill passed the California state legislature with
                    overwhelming support, and Newsom signed it on Friday along
                    with several other measures intended to protect domestic
                    violence survivors. The law could lead to the new standards
                    being implemented beyond California, as automakers tend to
                    avoid producing different cars for different states.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Legislative analysts cited reporting from Reuters and the
                    New York Times about carmakers which did not help women who
                    alleged they were being targeted by their partners. One
                    woman unsuccessfully sued Tesla, alleging the company failed
                    to act after she repeatedly complained that her husband was
                    stalking and harassing her with the automaker's technology
                    despite a restraining order.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among its provisions, the California bill requires
                    automakers to set up a clear process for drivers to submit a
                    copy of a restraining order or other documentation and
                    request termination of another driver's remote access within
                    two business days. It also mandates that carmakers enable
                    drivers to easily turn off location access from inside the
                    vehicle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No carmaker officially opposed the law. The Alliance for
                    Automotive Innovation, which counts several car
                    manufacturers as members, said it supports the goal of
                    protecting victims of domestic abuse. The Alliance raised
                    some concerns about technical feasibility during the
                    legislative process, and a spokesman said in an email on
                    Monday it has discussed ways to potentially address those
                    issues next year.

                While Perfctl and some of the malware it installs are detected
                by some antivirus software, Aqua Security researchers were
                unable to find any research reports on the malware. They were,
                however, able to find a wealth of threads on developer-related
                sites that discussed infections consistent with it.

                    posted to the CentOS subreddit is typical. An admin noticed
                    that two servers were infected with a cryptocurrency
                    hijacker with the names perfcc and perfctl. The admin wanted

                    in the April 2023 post. "However, the process would stop
                    immediately when I logged in via SSH or console. As soon as

                    After exploiting a vulnerability or misconfiguration, the
                    exploit code downloads the main payload from a server,
                    which, in most cases, has been hacked by the attacker and
                    converted into a channel for distributing the malware
                    anonymously. An attack that targeted the researchers'
                    honeypot named the payload httpd. Once executed, the file
                    copies itself from memory to a new location in the /temp
                    directory, runs it, and then terminates the original process
                    and deletes the downloaded binary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once moved to the /tmp directory, the file executes under a
                    different name, which mimics the name of a known Linux
                    process. The file hosted on the honeypot was named sh. From
                    there, the file establishes a local command-and-control
                    process and attempts to gain root system rights by
                    exploiting CVE-2021-4043, a privilege-escalation
                    vulnerability that was patched in 2021 in Gpac, a widely
                    used open source multimedia framework.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The malware goes on to copy itself from memory to a handful
                    of other disk locations, once again using names that appear
                    as routine system files. The malware then drops a rootkit, a
                    host of popular Linux utilities that have been modified to
                    serve as rootkits, and the miner. In some cases, the malware
                    also installs software for "proxy-jacking," the term for
                    surreptitiously routing traffic through the infected machine
                    so the true origin of the data isn't revealed.
                  </p>
                  <p>The researchers continued:</p>

                        As part of its command-and-control operation, the
                        malware opens a Unix socket, creates two directories
                        under the /tmp directory, and stores data there that
                        influences its operation. This data includes host
                        events, locations of the copies of itself, process
                        names, communication logs, tokens, and additional log
                        information. Additionally, the malware uses environment
                        variables to store data that further affects its
                        execution and behavior.

                        indicating significant efforts to bypass defense
                        mechanisms and hinder reverse engineering attempts. The
                        malware also uses advanced evasion techniques, such as
                        suspending its activity when it detects a new user in
                        the btmp or utmp files and terminating any competing
                        malware to maintain control over the infected system.

                    In addition to new funding sources and deployment
                    strategies, the study uncovered overlooked challenges that
                    aren't being widely addressed. Many early GenAI efforts
                    failed due to issues with data quality and the processes
                    used for model training and tuning – topics directly related
                    to provenance (determining the source and characteristics of
                    the model and data) and governance (procedures to ensure
                    output quality and mitigate potential risks).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among medium-sized businesses, a staggering 84% reported
                    having no provenance policies, and 64% lacked governance
                    policies. Large enterprises fared better, but even there,
                    about a quarter had no provenance policies, and a fifth had
                    no governance procedures. (See "<a
                      href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/two-words-critical-genais-future-bob-o-donnell-bhapc/"
                      >Two Words That Are Critical to GenAI's Future</a
                    >" for more on provenance and governance.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The number one benefit that organizations hope to get from
                    their GenAI initiatives is increased efficiency and
                    productivity followed by improved quality and accuracy of
                    output.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While some of the study's findings were surprising, others
                    confirmed what many in the industry have been thinking. The
                    number one benefit that organizations hope to get from their
                    GenAI initiatives, for example, is increased efficiency and
                    productivity followed by improved quality and accuracy of
                    output.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When asked to the rank the importance of the potential
                    outcomes of their GenAI efforts, however, the results showed
                    more pragmatic, measurable results. Most importantly,
                    companies said they wanted to create new products or
                    services with the help of GenAI, and reducing costs was
                    their second most important outcome. Not only does this
                    reflect the fact that benefits and importance don't always
                    align when it comes to these initiatives, but it also
                    indicates that organizations recognize what GenAI can offer
                    now, yet still have more aspirational goals for the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In terms of the GenAI-powered applications that
                    organizations are using, as Figure 3 illustrates, the first
                    and third top choices are text-related with Text-Based
                    Document Creation number one and Text-based Summarization
                    number three.

                  <p>
                    Collaboration-based applications came in second, reflecting
                    the popularity of GenAI features such as meeting
                    summarizations, automatic note-taking, language translation,
                    and other capabilities integrated into messaging platforms.
                    Despite their heavy usage, satisfaction with collaboration
                    tools was found to be lower than with other product
                    categories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study also dives into more detailed aspects of the
                    companies' GenAI efforts, including which foundation models
                    and platforms they're using, why they chose them, techniques
                    for data preparation and model fine-tuning, the deployment
                    of GenAI applications at the edge, on PCs, and on
                    smartphones, as well as the types of partners companies are
                    working with and the specific services they need.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, returning to the original theme, GenAI-powered
                    summarization and sentiment analysis of the survey
                    respondents' comments highlight that we're still in the
                    early stages of the GenAI revolution. While companies
                    expressed legitimate concerns about GenAI and its impact,
                    they also made it clear that they understand the long-term
                    potential of the technology and are eager to integrate it
                    into their organizations.

                    Often when I encounter a conspiracy theory I ask: "What does
                    the sharer have to gain? Are they telling me this because
                    they have an evidence-backed concern, or are they trying to

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Back in February, we celebrated our victory at trial in the
                    U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas
                    against patent trolls Sable IP and Sable Networks. This was
                    the culmination of nearly three years of litigation against
                    Sable, but it wasn't the end of the story.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today we're pleased to announce that the litigation against
                    Sable has finally concluded on terms that we believe send a
                    strong message to patent trolls everywhere — if you bring
                    meritless patent claims against Cloudflare, we will fight
                    back and we will win.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While Sable's technical expert tried his hardest to
                    convince the jury that various software and hardware
                    components of Cloudflare's servers constitute "line cards,"
                    his explanations defied credibility. The simple fact is that
                    Cloudflare's servers do not have line cards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ultimately, the jury understood, returning a verdict
                    that Cloudflare does not infringe claim 25 of the '919
                    patent.
                  </p>
                </div>

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    In the end, Sable agreed to pay Cloudflare $225,000, grant
                    Cloudflare a royalty-free license to its entire patent
                    portfolio, and to dedicate its patents to the public,
                    ensuring that Sable can never again assert them against
                    another company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Let's repeat that first part, just to make sure everyone
                    understands:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sable, the patent troll that sued Cloudflare back in March
                    2021 asserting around 100 claims across four patents, in the
                    end wound up paying Cloudflare. While this $225,000 can't
                    fully compensate us for the time, energy and frustration of
                    having to deal with this litigation for nearly three years,
                    it does help to even the score a bit. And we hope that it
                    sends an important message to patent trolls everywhere to
                    beware before taking on Cloudflare.

                    Officials in Ireland have fined Meta $101 million for
                    storing hundreds of millions of user passwords in plaintext
                    and making them broadly available to company employees.

                    in early 2019. The company said that apps for connecting to
                    various Meta-owned social networks had logged user passwords
                    in plaintext and stored them in a database that had been
                    searched by roughly 2,000 company engineers, who
                    collectively queried the stash more than 9 million times.<br />[...]<br />When
                    Meta disclosed the lapse in 2019, it was clear the company
                    had failed to adequately protect hundreds of millions of
                    passwords.

                    "It is widely accepted that user passwords should not be

                    Louisiana Democratic political consultant Steven Kramer was
                    indicted in May over the robocalls. The 39-second message,
                    which told people to 'save their votes' for the November
                    presidential election, was created using a text-to-speech
                    tool called ElevenLabs. The calls were spoofed so they
                    appeared to originate from the former chairwoman of the New
                    Hampshire Democratic Party, writes
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/us/politics/biden-robocalls-steve-kramer-democratic-primary.html"

                  <p>
                    Kramer had worked for Biden's primary rival, Rep. Dean
                    Phillips, who condemned the calls. Kramer claimed that he
                    paid $500 to have the calls sent to voters as a way of
                    raising awareness about the dangers artificial intelligence
                    can pose to election campaigns, which sounds like a
                    questionable justification.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For me to do that and get $5 million worth of exposure, not
                    for me," Kramer told
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bngnTezR7s"
                      >CBS New York</a
                    >. "I kept myself anonymous so the regulations could just
                    play themselves out or begin to play themselves out. I don't
                    need to be famous. That's not my intention. My intention was
                    to make a difference."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Making a strange story even weirder, Kramer hired an actual
                    New Orleans magician named Paul Carpenter to make the
                    robocalls. Carpenter said creating the recording only took
                    about 20 minutes and cost $1, and that Kramer paid him $150
                    via Venmo. He believed what he was doing had been authorized
                    by President Biden's campaign. Carpenter's account has since
                    been shut down by ElevenLabs.

                    The FCC writes that Kramer violated the Truth in Caller ID
                    Act, which makes spoofed calls illegal when made with the
                    intent to defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything
                    of value. The FCC this year

                    California governor Gavin Newsom vetoed the state’s
                    controversial AI safety law known as ‘Senate Bill 1047’
                    yesterday (29 September).

                    Newsom said he that did not think this legislation would be
                    the best approach to protect the public from threats posed
                    by AI.

                  <p>
                    “While well-intentioned, SB 1047 does not take into account
                    whether an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments,
                    involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive
                    data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Instead, the bill applies stringent standards to even the
                    most basic functions — so long as a large system deploys
                    it.”

                    Marred in controversy since its introduction earlier this

                    Introduced earlier this year by state senator Scott Wiener,

                    systems by putting more responsibilities on developers.

                    [...] Instead of SB 1047, governor Newsom announced that he

                    As a force for good, however, generative AI is being
                    deployed widely across global organizations, supporting key
                    cybersecurity functions such as threat detection and
                    response, and threat intelligence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Cybersecurity is predominantly a data science problem,"
                    said Mike Elmore, global CISO at GSK. "It's becoming
                    imperative for cyber defenders to leverage the power of
                    generative AI and machine learning to get closer to the data
                    to drive timely and actionable insights that matter the
                    most."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shockingly, PwC also found that business leaders who have
                    regulatory and legal requirements to improve security do
                    just that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Indeed, 96 percent said regulations prompted an organization
                    to improve its security, while 78 percent said the same regs
                    have challenged, improved, or increased their security
                    posture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Organizations that embrace regulatory requirements
                    tend to benefit from stronger security frameworks and a more
                    robust posture against emerging threats," read PwC's report.
                    "Compliance shouldn't be viewed as a box-ticking exercise
                    but as an opportunity to build long-term resilience and
                    trust with stakeholders."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These new regulations have also ushered in new investment
                    into cybersecurity. Roughly a third of organizations (32
                    percent) said cyber investment increased to a "large extent"
                    in the past 12 months. 37 percent said investment increased
                    to a "moderate extent," while 14 percent said the increase

                    The UK's last coal plant will sigh out its final pollutants
                    Monday before shutting down for good and officially ending
                    the country's century and a half of coal production.
                    Nottinghamshire's Ratcliffe-on-Soar plant was the last of
                    its kind following

                    >
                    to close all coal power plants by 2025. Ratcliffe was
                    originally scheduled to shut down in 2022 but stayed open
                    after Russia invaded Ukraine and Europe entered a gas
                    crisis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Ratcliffe plant once had 3,000 engineers but only
                    employs 170 staff now. That group will gather to watch a
                    livestream of the plant being turned off, and over 100 of
                    them are set to work on decommissioning the plant over the
                    next two years. Many of the other employees will enter new
                    jobs at different power plants owned by Uniper, Raticliffe's
                    German owner, while others will enter training programs to
                    work on other aspects of the industry.

                    Britain opened the world's first coal power plant in 1882,
                    London's Holborn Viaduct, with the help of Thomas Edison's
                    Edison Electric Light Company. Coal has played a major part
                    in the UK until very recently. According to a report from
                    energy think tank
                    <a
                      href="https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/the-uks-journey-to-a-coal-power-phase-out/#supporting-material"
                      >Ember</a
                    >, coal was responsible for 39 percent of the UK's energy
                    supply in 2012 but shrunk to just two percent in 2019. The

                    was reportedly equal to double the amount of all greenhouse
                    gases used in the UK in 2023. Between 2012 and 2023,

                    and solar generation also increased from six percent to a 34
                    percent share of the UK's energy. Britain still has a long
                    way to go, but this step has made it the first G7 country to
                    remove all coal power production.

                    Although we suspect most people probably use Firefox or
                    Chrome, GNOME's Epiphany web browser has a bunch of new
                    features. Now it can do automatic form filling, has better
                    bookmarks, improvements in the handling of text boxes and
                    the address field, as well as passwords, image contrast,
                    setting wallpapers, and more. Sadly, though, support for
                    Mozilla's Firefox Sync, missing for a few releases, hasn't
                    returned yet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many more changes are under the hood and less visible –
                    unless it means improved support for kit that you use, such
                    as VR headsets, which get better Wayland support. There's
                    improved handling for graphics tablets, including
                    customizing button actions and pressure sensitivity.
                    Graphics acceleration has also improved, especially on
                    Nvidia GPUs, and there's better handling of machines with
                    hybrid graphics. Interop with X11 apps is better, with
                    drag-and-drop, improved fractional scaling – but if you're
                    one of the people who wants to banish X.org forever, GNOME
                    can now be compiled entirely without X11 support.

                    Especially now with the return of limited custom color
                    selections, and Files' expanding functionality, we sometimes
                    get the feeling that after GNOME 3 got started by removing a
                    large range of functionality, over the years since the team
                    has been gradually adding it back, piecemeal. The growing
                    functionality of some of its accessory apps also makes us
                    wonder if the project might not save itself some work by
                    cooperating more with existing external projects. However,

                    Whatever the reasons, it is the flagship desktop of most
                    Linux distributions today. It's the only choice on both SUSE
                    and Red Hat's enterprise flavors, as well as being the
                    default in Debian, Ubuntu, and many others. As such, long
                    may it grow and flourish.

                    and burned amid scrutiny from security researchers and
                    testers over the summer. The former version of Recall
                    recorded screenshots and OCR text of all user activity, and
                    stored it unencrypted on disk where it could easily be

                    As AMD flexes its muscles in the AI game, it is not only

                    authorities, so probably not), but this is a clear step in
                    the direction of addressing the needs of specific customers
                    with a pre-trained model done by AMD - using AMD hardware
                    for inference.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The main reason why AMD's models are fast is because they
                    use so-called speculative decoding. Speculative decoding
                    introduces a smaller 'draft model' that generates multiple
                    candidate tokens in a single forward pass. Tokens are then
                    passed to a larger, more accurate 'target model' that
                    verifies or corrects them. On the one hand, this approach
                    allows for multiple tokens to be generated simultaneously,
                    yet on the other hand this comes at the cost of power due to
                    increased data transactions.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] AMD believes that further optimizations can lead to
                    even better performance. Yet, as the company shares
                    benchmark numbers of its previous-generation GPUs, we can
                    only imagine what its current-generation (MI300X) and
                    next-generation (MI325X) could do.

                    Ampere's debts are set to mature beginning June 2026, when
                    Oracle will have the option of converting those investments
                    into additional equity in the chip startup. "If either of
                    such options is exercised by us or our co-investors, we
                    would obtain control of Ampere and consolidate its results
                    with our results of operations," the filing explains.

                    According to the document, Oracle spent roughly $48 million
                    on Ampere processors during its 2023 fiscal year – some of
                    it direct with Ampere and some through a third party. By
                    comparison, Big Red spent just $3 million on Ampere's chips
                    and had $101.1 million worth of products available under a
                    pre-payment order by the end of fiscal year 2024.

                    SpaceX celebrated the first human spaceflight from its Cape
                    Canaveral launch site on Saturday, and while the two humans
                    aboard the Crew Dragon Freedom are safely on their way to
                    the International Space Station, a problem arose with the
                    rocket's second stage that prompted the company to shut down
                    future launches for now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "After today's successful launch of Crew-9, Falcon 9's
                    second stage was disposed in the ocean as planned, but
                    experienced an off-nominal deorbit burn," SpaceX posted on
                    X. "As a result, the second stage safely landed in the
                    ocean, but outside of the targeted area. We will resume
                    launching after we better understand [the] root cause."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first victim of the shutdown was a planned launch Sunday
                    from California of a Falcon 9 with a plan to send up the
                    OneWeb Launch 20 mission for EutelsatGroup.

                  <p>
                    The Federal Aviation Administration still has that launch on
                    its operations plan advisory for as early as Oct. 1, but the
                    last two times SpaceX had an "off-nominal" issue with a
                    Falcon 9 launch, the FAA had grounded the rocket.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The most recent was a fiery landing of a Falcon 9's
                    first-stage booster last month during a Starlink mission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The FAA investigates commercial space incidents to
                    determine the root cause and identify corrective actions so
                    they won't happen again," the FAA said in a statement after
                    that incident.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Any significant delay in launches could affect the
                    upcoming Falcon Heavy launch of NASA's Europa Clipper

                    like a giant egg, looks like "a translucent, fuzzy white
                    cotton ball," ESA explained. The jet, as you can see, is the
                    wavy blue beam blasting out from the galactic core, home to
                    the supermassive black hole (it has the mass of

                    explodes like a giant nuclear bomb," the agency explained.
                    And then the gradual process renews.

                    operators will need Beijing's approval to offer their

                    China is an enormous market, but <em>The Register</em> can't
                    imagine that space broadband players like SpaceX or Amazon
                    will be keen to sign up for Beijing's rules – especially as
                    Elon Musk's professed fervent belief in free speech is at
                    odds with China's desire to monitor content and require
                    takedowns. Then again, maybe it's not as fervent as his
                    desire to sell lots of Teslas in China.

                    SESAC is nearing its end, and the two have struggled to
                    agree on a new deal. Without an agreement in place, YouTube
                    will no longer be able to host songs covered by SESAC.

                    Until YouTube and SESAC can also reach an agreement, the

                    a new partnership with
                    <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/">Valve</a>, the
                    company behind the Steam gaming platform and
                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"
                      >Steam Deck</a
                    >. This collaboration will see Valve financially support two
                    major projects for Arch Linux: an improved build service
                    infrastructure and a secure signing enclave.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] By providing freelance backing, Valve's support allows
                    Arch Linux to work on these critical projects without being
                    hindered by limitations in volunteer time. This will
                    significantly accelerate progress and enable the Arch Linux
                    team to tackle ambitious endeavours that would have
                    otherwise taken much longer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The collaboration will lead to the development of a robust
                    build service infrastructure. This infrastructure will
                    involve servers for building software, potentially similar
                    to continuous integration systems. The system will likely
                    manage compiling and distributing software, simplifying the
                    process and reducing the need for custom setups for
                    different devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The introduction of a secure signing enclave marks a
                    significant advancement in security for Arch Linux. This
                    enclave will leverage code signing to provide a higher level
                    of assurance that packages downloaded from the official
                    repositories haven't been tampered with. Users will be able
                    to cryptographically verify the origin and integrity of
                    software packages, making it much harder for malicious
                    actors to distribute compromised software.

                There is speculation that Valve might publicly release SteamOS
                in the future or that native support for games on GNU/Linux will
                improve greatly.

                    There are few bigger names in the world of motorcycles than
                    Harley-Davidson. The brand has been churning out two-wheeled
                    classics left and right for over a century, cultivating a
                    fanbase like no other. Along the way,

                    arise, in addition to plenty that have fallen by the
                    wayside. Seeing as it's rarely talked about in the modern
                    era, it's no stretch to say that one of these overlooked
                    points on the Harley timeline is the brand's brief foray
                    into lawn mower technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yes, as it was making its name as one of the United States'
                    foremost motorcycle manufacturers, Harley-Davidson took a
                    detour into landscaping territory. Way back in 1929, the
                    company began providing single cylinder side-valve engines
                    for the Worthington Mower Company's Overgreen lawn mowers.
                    These massive mowers were used commercially to cut large
                    swaths of grass like golf courses. Harley's engines powered
                    them throughout the Great Depression, though the motorcycle
                    giant didn't stick with lawn mowers for the long haul. Thus,
                    it was never destined to sit alongside
                    <a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It has been nearly 100 years since Harley-Davidson's
                    Worthington collaboration came and went, yet some folks are
                    still keen on trying to power their mowers with the bike
                    favorite's technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With modern perceptions of Harley-Davidson as strictly a
                    motorcycle brand, the idea of it contributing to the
                    Worthington Mower Company's Overgreen lawn mowers sounds
                    absurd. After all, throughout its century-long history, it
                    has only branched out to create non-motorcycle products a
                    few times. For instance, it created the LR-64 drone rocket
                    engine for the U.S. military, and took a dip in the marine
                    technology pool with its purchase of the Tomahawk Boating
                    Company in 1961. Still, this hasn't prevented some folks
                    from trying to bring its modern tech to back to the realm of
                    landscaping.

                    Over on YouTube,

                      >Specialised Motorcycle Transport</a
                    >
                    showcased what a modern lawn mower could look like with a
                    Harley engine inside. It looks like a conventional riding
                    mower with some unique aesthetic touches, but sounds just
                    like motorcycle and is designed to get the speed of one too.
                    This contraption was constructed for racing purposes rather
                    than lawn maintenance.

                    on YouTube featured a similar piece on their channel. This
                    orange riding mower — dubbed the "mower cycle" — came
                    equipped with a 1,500cc Harley engine, certainly making it
                    better suited for the racetrack than for cutting grass. It
                    more than likely can't outrun

                    the dust.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Odds are Harley-Davidson's efforts in terms of lawn mowing
                    are long over, but so long as mechanics can make its engines
                    compatible with the latest riding mowers, chances are its
                    legacy in the space will endure well into the future.

                  <p>
                    Fifth, the GDPR, on principle, posits that every processing
                    of personal data restricts the data subject’s right to data
                    protection. It requires, therefore, that each of these
                    processes needs a justification based on the law. The GDPR
                    deems any processing of personal data as a potential risk
                    and forbids its processing in principle. It only allows
                    processing if a legal ground is met. Such an anti-processing
                    and anti-sharing approach may not make sense in a
                    data-driven economy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sixth, the law does not distinguish between low-risk and
                    high-risk applications by imposing the same obligations for
                    each type of data processing application, with a few
                    exceptions requiring consultation of the Data Processing
                    Administrator for high-risk applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Seventh, the GDPR also excludes exemptions for low-risk
                    processing scenarios or when SMEs, startups, non-commercial
                    entities, or private citizens are the data controllers.
                    Further, there are no exemptions or provisions that protect
                    the rights of the controller and of third parties for such
                    scenarios in which the data controller has a legitimate
                    interest in protecting business and trade secrets,
                    fulfilling confidentiality obligations, or the economic
                    interest in avoiding huge and disproportionate efforts to
                    meet GDPR obligations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eighth, the GDPR lacks a mechanism that allows SMEs and
                    startups to shift the compliance burden onto third parties,
                    which then store and process data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ninth, the GPR relies heavily on government-based
                    bureaucratic monitoring and administration of GDPR privacy
                    compliance. This means an extensive bureaucratic system is
                    needed to manage the compliance regime.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are other issues with GDPR enforcement (see pieces by
                    <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gdpr-2022"

                    opted to go with SpaceX to bring the stuck astronauts home.

                    retiring more than a decade ago. SpaceX beat Boeing in
                    delivering astronauts to the space station in 2020 and it's

                    SpaceX took over the old Titan rocket pad nearly two decades

                    GitHub. The Winamp for Windows project, as it's officially
                    called by Llama Group, will receive a few updates per year,
                    adding new features and ensuring proper security practices.
                    Just don't get your hopes up about creating alternative
                    projects from this "freely" available code.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Llama Group is looking to the

                    for help in developing new capabilities and maintaining (or
                    even modernizing) a codebase that dates back several
                    decades. Originally introduced in 1997, Winamp has long been
                    praised for its flexibility and broad compatibility with
                    various audio formats.

                  <p>
                    [...] Winamp's source code is now freely available, but the
                    license it was released under has sparked controversy. The
                    <a

                    >
                    imposes significant restrictions on what people can do with
                    the code, including a ban on releasing modified third-party
                    modified versions. The license explicitly states that no
                    public forks are permitted, and only the maintainers of the
                    official repository are allowed to release the software or
                    any new (approved) modifications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Llama Group appears eager to benefit from community
                    contributions to Winamp, but the software itself cannot be
                    repurposed to create something new. Despite the legal
                    threat, developers are undeterred, with hundreds of
                    "unofficial" forks of Winamp's source code already surfacing
                    online. As time goes on, this trend is only expected to
                    grow.

                  <p>
                    Legal concerns aside, it seems clear that Llama Group no
                    longer wants the full responsibility of maintaining the
                    still-popular PC media player. The company has shifted its

                    in Antarctica has concluded with a grim outlook on its
                    future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Often dubbed the “doomsday glacier”, this huge mass of ice
                    is comparable in size to Britain or Florida and its collapse
                    alone would raise sea levels by 65 centimetres. Worse still,
                    this is expected to trigger a more widespread loss of the
                    ice sheet covering West Antarctica, causing a calamitous sea
                    level rise of 3.3 metres and threatening cities like New
                    York, Kolkata and Shanghai.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is an extremely remote and difficult area to get to, but
                    the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC), a
                    joint UK-US research programme, has managed to deploy 100
                    scientists there over the past six years, using planes,
                    ships and underwater robots to study the dynamics of this
                    ice in detail.  “It was a tremendous challenge, and yet we
                    really learned a lot,” says
                    <a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/people/ted-scambos"
                      >Ted Scambos</a
                    >
                    at University of Colorado Boulder.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These discoveries include the fact that Thwaites glacier is
                    particularly vulnerable, as it rests on a bed of rock that
                    is well below sea level and is being melted from the
                    underside by warmer seawater. What’s more, the bedrock
                    slopes downwards towards the interior of the ice sheet, so,
                    as the glacier retreats, even more ice is exposed to warm
                    seawater, threatening to accelerate the collapse.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “It’s not going to instantaneously lead to a
                    catastrophic retreat in the next year or the year after,
                    but, at the same time, we are very sure that Thwaites is
                    going to continue to retreat, and ultimately the retreat is
                    going to accelerate,” says
                    <a href="https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/rdla/">Rob Larter</a>
                    at the British Antarctic Survey, another member of the team.
                    “We can’t put an exact time frame on that.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, however, the ITCG researchers think that, by the
                    end of the 23<sup>rd</sup> century, Thwaites glacier and
                    much of the West Antarctic ice sheet might be lost.

                    On Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman outlined his vision for an
                    AI-driven future of tech progress and global prosperity in a
                    new personal blog post titled "<a

                      >The Intelligence Age.</a
                    >" The essay paints a picture of human advancement
                    accelerated by AI, with Altman suggesting that
                    superintelligent AI could emerge within the next decade.
                  </p>

                    "It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few
                    thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I'm confident
                    we'll get there," he wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    (artificial general intelligence), which is a term for
                    hypothetical technology that could match human intelligence
                    in performing many tasks without the need for specific
                    training. By contrast, superintelligence surpasses AGI, and
                    it could be seen as a hypothetical level of machine
                    intelligence that can dramatically outperform humans at any
                    intellectual task, perhaps even to an unfathomable
                    degree.<br />[...]<br />Despite the criticism, it's notable
                    when the CEO of what is probably the defining AI company of
                    the moment makes a broad prediction about future
                    capabilities—even if that means he's perpetually trying to

                  <p>
                    "If we want to put AI into the hands of as many people as
                    possible," Altman writes in his essay, "we need to drive
                    down the cost of compute and make it abundant (which
                    requires lots of energy and chips). If we don't build enough
                    infrastructure, AI will be a very limited resource that wars
                    get fought over and that becomes mostly a tool for rich
                    people."<br />[...]<br />While enthusiastic about AI's
                    potential, Altman urges caution, too, but vaguely. He
                    writes, "We need to act wisely but with conviction. The dawn
                    of the Intelligence Age is a momentous development with very
                    complex and extremely high-stakes challenges. It will not be
                    an entirely positive story, but the upside is so tremendous
                    that we owe it to ourselves, and the future, to figure out
                    how to navigate the risks in front of us."<br />[...]<br />"Many
                    of the jobs we do today would have looked like trifling
                    wastes of time to people a few hundred years ago, but nobody
                    is looking back at the past, wishing they were a
                    lamplighter," he wrote. "If a lamplighter could see the
                    world today, he would think the prosperity all around him
                    was unimaginable. And if we could fast-forward a hundred
                    years from today, the prosperity all around us would feel
                    just as unimaginable."

                    If you're thinking of going down the unconventional route
                    for this year's Halloween costume, we've got just the
                    inspiration for you: a brand-new species of chimaera, better
                    known as a ghost shark or

                    Scientists discovered the new species, which goes by the
                    scientific name <em>Harriotta avia</em> –
                    <em>avia</em> meaning "grandmother" in Latin, in honor of
                    study author Dr Brit Finucci's grandmother – and the common
                    name Australasian Narrow-nosed Spookfish, off the coast of
                    New Zealand and Australia.

                    – the study describing the new species dubs it "a global
                    diversity [hotspot] for chimaeroids" – but it was previously
                    thought that this particular species wasn't actually its own
                    species at all. Instead, it was believed to be a variant of
                    another species, <em>Harriotta raleighana</em>, which is
                    found across the globe.

                    But with the help of genetics and a closer inspection of its
                    morphology, the researchers were able to identify
                    <em>H. avia</em> as a species in its own right.

                  <p>
                    "<em>Harriotta avia</em> is unique due to its elongated,
                    narrow and depressed snout; long, slender trunk; large eyes;
                    and very long, broad pectoral fins," said Finucci in a

                    "Their habitat makes them hard to study and monitor, meaning
                    we don't know a lot about their biology or threat status,
                    but it makes discoveries like this even more exciting,"
                    Finucci explained.

                    What we do know is that, despite the nickname, ghost sharks
                    aren't actually sharks at all. Whilst the two groups are
                    still related to each other, it's thought that they

                    several physical differences from their relatives.

                    This is where the trucks come in: The traffic on German
                    autobahns that most consistently conforms to that pattern
                    are the swarms of semis that are constantly crisscrossing
                    the country. "The trucks are generally limited to 80km/h
                    (50mph)," says Drive Pilot test engineer Jochen Haab," but
                    they usually travel at about 90km/h, and up to 95km/h on
                    downhills."<br />Drive Pilot 95 could operate without having
                    to follow traffic, Haab says, but making that part of its
                    operational design domain provides an additional safety
                    redundancy: If there is traffic ahead, and it is moving, the
                    car knows for certain the road ahead is clear without
                    needing to process more data to double check.<br />A highly
                    precise positioning antenna mounted in the roof enables the
                    car to know, to within a fraction of an inch, exactly where
                    it is in terms of its absolute position, its relative
                    position, and its position correlated to carefully measured
                    landmarks on an HD map built from data collected
                    Mercedes-Benz engineers who drove every single mile of
                    Germany's 8,196-mile autobahn network in both directions and

                    Ferroelectric memory (FRAM) is an interesting storage
                    technique that stores bits in a special "ferroelectric"
                    material. Ferroelectric memory is nonvolatile like flash
                    memory, able to hold its data for decades. But, unlike
                    flash, ferroelectric memory can write data rapidly.
                    Moreover, FRAM is much more durable than flash and can be be
                    written trillions of times. With these advantages, you might
                    wonder why FRAM isn't more popular. The problem is that FRAM
                    is much more expensive than flash, so it is only used in
                    niche applications.

                  <p>
                    [...] The history of ferroelectric memory dates back to the
                    early 1950s.3 Many companies worked on FRAM from the 1950s
                    to the 1970s, including Bell Labs, IBM, RCA, and Ford. The
                    1955 photo below shows a 256-bit ferroelectric memory built
                    by Bell Labs. Unfortunately, ferroelectric memory had many
                    problems,4 limiting it to specialized applications, and
                    development was mostly abandoned by the 1970s.

                  <p>
                    Ferroelectric memory had a second chance, though. A major
                    proponent of ferroelectric memory was George Rohrer, who
                    started working on ferroelectric memory in 1968. He formed a
                    memory company, Technovation, which was unsuccessful, and
                    then cofounded Ramtron in 1984.5 Ramtron produced a tiny
                    256-bit memory chip in 1988, followed by much larger
                    memories in the 1990s.

                    "How enzymes tie a lasso knot is a fascinating question.
                    This study provides a first glimpse of the biophysical
                    interactions responsible for producing this unique
                    structure," said Diwakar Shukla, an associate professor of
                    chemical and biomolecular engineering.

                  <p>
                    "We also showed that these molecular contacts are the same
                    in several different cyclases across different phyla. Even
                    though we have not tested every system, we believe it's a
                    generalizable model," Barrett said.

                    Collaborating with the San Diego-based company Lassogen, the
                    researchers showed that the new insights can guide cyclase
                    engineering to generate lasso peptides that otherwise cannot
                    be made. As a proof-of-concept, they engineered a different
                    cyclase, called McjC, to efficiently produce a potent
                    inhibitor of a cancer-promoting integrin.

                    "The ability to generate lasso peptide diversity is
                    important for optimizing drugs," said Mark Burk, CEO of
                    Lassogen. "The enzymes from nature do not always allow us to
                    produce the lasso peptides of interest and the ability to
                    engineer lasso cyclases greatly expands the therapeutic
                    utility of these amazing molecules."

                    powerful computing and recent advances in artificial
                    intelligence and cell-free biosynthetic methods," said
                    Douglas Mitchell, John and Margaret Witt Professor of
                    Chemistry. "This work is an extraordinary example of how

                    Shares of General Motors and Ford Motor traded lower on
                    Wednesday after Morgan Stanley downgraded the overall U.S.
                    auto sector, citing worries that Western automakers might
                    struggle in the intensifying competition with Chinese

                    $45.50. Ford went to "equal weight" from "overweight," with
                    its shares dropping more than 4 percentage points, to
                    $10.43.

                    Investors sold after Morgan Stanley analysts warned about
                    what they called the "China butterfly effect," a metaphor
                    suggesting that even small surges in China's industrial
                    production capacity could have significant ripple effects
                    across the global market.

                    [...] Bolstered in part by massive government subsidies,
                    Chinese manufacturers have rapidly emerged as major players
                    in the EV industry, accounting for 60 percent of worldwide
                    EV sales and almost one in five EVs sold in Europe last
                    year.

                    at the center of one of the greatest miscarriages of justice
                    in the UK. From 1999 until 2015, 736 local branch managers
                    were wrongfully convicted of fraud when errors in the system
                    were to blame. The total value of the Horizon contract is
                    £2.38 billion ($3.15 billion). It is due to expire on March
                    31, 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers warn that poor-performing suppliers to
                    UK government are virtually never excluded from supplying
                    the public sector and often continue to receive government
                    money. Meanwhile, a large number of contracts, totaling
                    billions of pounds, are overseen by officials who are not
                    commercial specialists.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The report also highlights that poor data across government
                    departments meant officials didn't know how much they were

                There is a fair, and long running, amount of research for that
                playing Tetris helps people deal with trauma, PTSD of some kind.
                Adding some more recent research then where it can reduce PTSD
                symptoms in healthcare workers (nurses) that worked with trauma
                COVID19 patients.

                Playing something such as Tetris (it's a bit unclear if it's
                just Tetris or a similar style of games of which Tetris is the
                prime example) can induce some relaxing zen like state or a
                "cognitive vaccine". 20 minutes is apparently the prescribed
                dosage of rotational healing experience. There was the 15
                minutes of talking to before playing Tetris. But clearly the
                healing power of Tetris at work ...

                    The study was carried out with healthcare workers in Sweden
                    who worked with COVID-19 patients and were exposed to
                    work-related trauma. It was conducted during the COVID-19
                    pandemic between September 2020 and April 2022. A total of
                    164 participants were included. Participants were recruited
                    through information at workplaces. Participation was
                    entirely voluntary. The criterion for participation was that
                    the person had at least two intrusive memories per week due
                    to traumatic events that occurred at work.

                    A truck full of lithium-ion batteries is burning in Los
                    Angeles, shutting down ports and a bridge. It’s not clear
                    what the batteries were for — but LA’s Vincent Thomas
                    Bridge, leading to the Port of Los Angeles and the next-door
                    Port of Long Beach, has been shut down for at least 15 hours
                    now while local firefighters let the truck burn. State Route
                    47 was also closed in both directions as of a couple of
                    hours ago.

                    shut down a number of terminals while the fire continues to
                    burn. As of 12:10PM PT on Friday, the truck was still on
                    fire, and both the ports and bridge were still closed, Los
                    Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) spokesperson Ren Medina told

                    >, big concentrated lithium battery fires can be very
                    difficult to put out: firefighters sometimes douse them with
                    thousands of gallons of water only to see the fire restart
                    as additional battery cells heat up to the point that they
                    combust. Once a cell gets hot enough, it’s said to go into
                    “thermal runaway,” at which point it can sometimes restart a
                    fire. The LAFD confirms this is a case of thermal runaway.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    EV packs are particularly dense with cells, but we don’t yet
                    know if they were involved here — the LA Fire Department
                    spokesperson says it’s not clear who owns the truck, let
                    alone what it was carrying. The LAFD could only confirm they
                    are lithium-ion batteries at this point.

                A senior RedMonk analyst tried to prove shifting to proprietary

                >
                -- from a VC at OSS Capital, ex-Googlers, Chef's co-founder, and
                even Taylor Dolezal, head of ecosystem at the Cloud Native
                Computing Community. Plus analyst Lawrence Hecht, who concluded
                "these companies are nowhere closer to being profitable than
                before."
              </p>
              <p>
                There's new quotes from the analyst herself. ("I asked Stephens
                if she thought the analysis would have an impact in the future
                on companies considering moves to proprietary licensing. 'I
                doubt it,' Stephens replied...") And Hecht pounds away at the
                missteps. ("The assumption has been that closing a company's
                license will allow the companies to increase their margins among
                their existing customers... The percentage of companies using a
                given technology is not changing... Elasticsearch fell from 14%
                to 13%..")
              </p>
              <p>
                Interestingly, the study hits right as Elastic is switching
                *back* to an open-source license. They weigh in in this article
                too...
              </p>
              <p>
                It's the discussion about open source licensing that really
                needed to happen.

                    Hardware hacker Dmitry Grinberg recently achieved what might
                    sound impossible:
                    <a
                      href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=35.%20Linux4004"

                    >
                    the world's first commercial microprocessor. With just 2,300
                    transistors and an original clock speed of 740 kHz, the 1971
                    CPU is incredibly primitive by modern standards. And it's
                    slow—it takes about 4.76 days for the Linux kernel to boot.

                    [....] If you're skeptical that this feat is possible with a
                    raw 4004, you're right: The 4004 itself is far too limited
                    to run Linux directly. Instead, Grinberg created a solution
                    that is equally impressive: an emulator that runs on the
                    4004 and emulates a MIPS R3000 processor—the architecture
                    used in the
