                    Intel has begun to send formal notifications to 1,300
                    employees at its Gordon Moore Park facility, saying that
                    they only have until next month to stay in their position.
                    This massive job cut is part of the company’s plan to

                      >The Oregonian</a
                    >, this reduction-in-force will affect more than 5% of the
                    Intel workforce in Oregon, and would make it one of the
                    largest layoffs in the state’s history.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Note that this does not include the number of employees that
                    took voluntary severance, buyouts, and early retirement
                    options. Given that the company had 23,000 workers in its
                    Oregon site earlier this year, a 15% reduction would drop
                    this to less than 20,000 employees. The 1,300 affected
                    workers would be less than half of Intel’s target reduction.
                    So, if the company will apply its reduction evenly across
                    the board, we could expect the number of workers that will
                    leave Intel, whether voluntary or not, to reach over 3,000.

                    evolve. "It's kind of like cybersecurity," says Mantooth.

                    Over the past four years, the Dragon spacecraft has returned
                    eight NASA crews by performing a parachute-assisted
                    splashdown in the ocean, but the crew capsule now has a
                    backup landing method in the event of an emergency.

                  <p>
                    SpaceX’s Dragon can land propulsively using its eight
                    SuperDraco thrusters, a feature that was originally intended
                    to be the spacecraft’s main way of returning to Earth but
                    was later scrapped due to safety concerns. During the live

                    of the Crew-9 launch on September 27, NASA officials
                    announced that in the event that all four parachutes fail to
                    deploy, Dragon would land on a solid surface using the
                    SuperDracos launch abort system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Dragon was always designed to land propulsively, but I
                    didn’t want to risk it as the primary method,” SpaceX CEO
                    Elon Musk

                    on X. During the early days of its development, SpaceX
                    marketed Dragon’s ability to land using its eight SuperDraco
                    engines, which would slow the spacecraft down during its
                    descent until its velocity reached zero, at that point its
                    landing legs would extend so the capsule can touch down on
                    the pad. However, a lot can change in ten years.

                    [...] By now, NASA has plenty of reason to trust SpaceX and
                    its ability to launch and return its crew of astronauts
                    safely to Earth. The Dragon spacecraft that recently
                    launched to the International Space Station is also

                    More than 6,500 volunteers have supported the accurate
                    identification of approximately 1,000 prehistoric burial
                    mounds in the Netherlands in just four months, proving the
                    value of involving volunteers in archaeology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2018, the Heritage Quest project was launched to harness
                    the power of citizen scientists, utilizing crowd-sourcing to
                    identify archaeological features on lidar imagery of the
                    central Netherlands.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Through the involvement of thousands of people online,
                    prehistoric burial mounds were identified across the region
                    in a short amount of time. However, the accuracy of
                    crowd-sourced data has been questioned in the past, as the
                    majority of volunteers are not professional archaeologists.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "While the volume of data exceeded our expectations, we
                    faced a key challenge common to large citizen science
                    projects: how reliable are the detections made by
                    volunteers?" states lead author of the research, Dr. Quentin
                    Bourgeois from Leiden University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To assess the accuracy of the data, the authors performed a
                    ground-based survey of 380 sites identified during the
                    study, examining them in person to determine whether they
                    were in fact prehistoric barrows. Their results are
                    published in the journal <i>Antiquity</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Dr. Bourgeois, the results are clear. "Citizen
                    science works. We found a direct correlation between the
                    number of volunteers identifying a potential archaeological
                    object and its likelihood of being a prehistoric burial
                    mound."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This means that the Heritage Quest project has discovered
                    1,000 previously-unknown burial mounds, doubling the number
                    of known mounds from the region in just four months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Importantly, this shows the value of involving volunteers in
                    archaeological projects, allowing for the identification of
                    archaeological features much more quickly than could be
                    achieved by professionals alone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "But for me the most amazing outcome is seeing the
                    passion the volunteers had for our research. They have now
                    become vocal advocates for the preserved traces of
                    prehistoric landscapes in their region."

                    [...] Kairos Power was founded in 2016 with the goal of
                    developing “innovative nuclear technology”. The company only
                    secured permission to build a test reactor in December last
                    year. The reactor is called Hermes and will be based in
                    Tennessee. In February, the US Department of Energy agreed
                    to provide up to $303m to help build Hermes.

                    It is possible that Google’s SMRs will face delays. The
                    completion date for Hermes has already slipped to 2027 in

                    this article. After Russian’s invasion of Ukraine, the US
                    banned uranium imports from Russia and now has just three
                    years’ supply left. Kairos says it is working with a
                    European consortium to source uranium.

                    that exposure to toxic voice chat in Call of Duty has
                    declined by 43 percent since the beginning of this year. The
                    publisher credits the recent implementation of AI-based
                    moderation for the results, which have convinced it to
                    expand its use when Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on
                    October 25.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The publisher introduced the moderator, ToxMod, when it
                    launched Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III last November.
                    According to ToxMod's website, the system analyzes text
                    transcripts of in-game voice chat and detects keywords based
                    on multiple factors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To tell the difference between trash talk and harassment,
                    ToxMod monitors keywords and reactions to comments,
                    recognizing player emotions and understanding the game's
                    code of conduct. Furthermore, the system estimates the
                    perceived age and gender of the speaker and recipients to
                    understand each conversation's context better.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ToxMod can't ban anyone on its own, but it can quickly flag
                    violations for review by human moderators. Activision then
                    decides whether to warn or mute players, only issuing bans
                    after repeated infractions. The number of repeat offenders
                    in Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone fell by 67
                    percent since Activision implemented improvements in June
                    2024. In July alone, 80 percent of players caught violating
                    voice chat rules didn't re-offend.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All regions except Asia currently support ToxMod, and Call
                    of Duty uses the system to moderate voice chat in English,
                    Spanish, and Portuguese. When Black Ops 6 launches,
                    Activision will add support for French and German.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, text-based chat and username moderation expanded
                    from 14 to 20 languages in August. Community Sift has been
                    Call of Duty's text moderation partner since the first
                    Modern Warfare reboot game launched in 2019, blocking 45
                    million messages since Modern Warfare III's November
                    release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using AI to moderate player behavior is far less
                    controversial than employing the technology for in-game
                    assets. Late last year, AI-generated art

                    in content skins for Modern Warfare III. Amid the historic
                    number of gaming industry layoffs occurring around that
                    time, some fear publishers will try to replace artists with
                    AI models.

                    parent-teacher associations, campus clubs, sports teams and
                    the like – use on flyers offering information about

                    healthcare organizations, housing providers, and large

                    working on high-value projects in aerospace, engineering,
                    nuclear science, or other sensitive topics in partnership
                    with multiple government agencies," the report notes.

                    "For cyber attackers, it can be easier to first compromise

                  <p>
                    So, for example, after compromising credentials belonging to
                    a professor or researcher, an attacker could then send an
                    email from a university account to a government official and

                    Unfortunately, there's no easy fix when it comes to
                    education-sector security. It requires a lot of user
                    education for students and staff about best practices, like
                    multifactor authentication (MFA).

                    resolution before Musk runs X into the ground, the
                    executives on Thursday asked the court to approve discovery
                    on all claims except the claim disputed in the motion to
                    dismiss.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Discovery on those topics is inevitable, and there is no
                    reason to further delay," the executives argued.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The executives have requested that the court open discovery
                    at a hearing scheduled for November 15 to prevent further
                    delays that they fear could harm their severance claims.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Neither X nor a lawyer for the former Twitter executives,
                    David Anderson, could immediately be reached for comment.

                    The Intel LGA 1700 socket, compatible with Intel’s 12th,
                    13th, and 14th Gen Core processors, has gained a lot of
                    attention due to a unique issue: bending and warping of the
                    CPUs. This phenomenon has been associated with higher
                    operating temperatures, as it affects the evenness of
                    contact with the CPU cooler. In response, several companies
                    have developed contact frame replacements to mitigate these
                    effects. This article will explore how these frames work,
                    their benefits, and what recent developments mean for users
                    of Intel’s latest processors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The elongated design of Intel's LGA 1700 CPUs makes them
                    susceptible to bending when installed in the motherboard's
                    socket. This happens due to the pressure exerted by the
                    Independent Loading Mechanism (ILM), which secures the CPU
                    in place. When the CPU is not in full contact with the
                    cooler, it can lead to uneven heat distribution and
                    ultimately, higher temperatures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Several manufacturers, including Thermal Grizzly and
                    Thermalright, have developed replacement ILMs for the LGA
                    1700 socket, aiming to enhance cooling efficiency by
                    ensuring better contact.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Replacing the stock ILM with a custom contact frame is a
                    popular solution for addressing the bending issue. These
                    aftermarket contact frames offer several key benefits:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Better Thermal Contact: Custom frames reduce bending,
                      allowing the integrated heat spreader (IHS) of the CPU to
                      make more consistent contact with the cooler's base. This
                      helps in maintaining more even temperature distribution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Improved Temperature Management: For example, testing with
                      Thermalright's LGA1700-BCF contact frame on an Asus TUF
                      Gaming Z790 Plus motherboard, paired with an Intel Core
                      i9-13900K, showed a temperature reduction of up to 12°C.
                      This significant decrease can be crucial for users looking
                      to overclock their CPUs or simply maintain cooler, more
                      stable systems.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Intel’s upcoming Arrow Lake processors, such as the Core
                    Ultra 9, bring new challenges. Although the LGA 1700 and LGA
                    1851 sockets are similar in size, the Arrow Lake CPUs are
                    slightly taller and thinner, with a shifted hotspot. This
                    means that existing contact frames may not provide optimal
                    performance, as they could interfere with the CPU’s metal
                    casing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Arrow Lake processors are designed to work on the
                    next-generation Z890 motherboards, which are rumored to
                    include a Reduced Load ILM. This new ILM design spreads
                    contact points over more areas of the IHS, potentially
                    reducing the likelihood of CPU warping and thereby improving
                    cooling efficiency without needing aftermarket solutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While new contact frames have not been announced for the
                    Z890 motherboard lineup, this could imply that Intel’s
                    Reduced Load ILM design might address the temperature issues
                    seen with previous LGA 1700 sockets. By reducing pressure on
                    the CPU and ensuring uniform contact with the cooler, these
                    new ILMs could help minimize warping and optimize thermal
                    performance.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's not immediately clear if the service module on OTV-7 is
                    of the same design, or if it's bigger. As we noted in our
                    discussion of OTV-7's choice of a SpaceX Falcon Heavy for
                    launch, the rocket gave the Space Force way more cargo
                    capacity, meaning the service module could be larger.

                  <p>
                    Either way, it looks like the plan is to get it ejected from
                    the craft itself as part of the aerobraking maneuver.
                    According to the Space Force, part of the orbital adjustment
                    will include the X-37B "safely dispos[ing] of its service
                    module components in accordance with recognized standards
                    for space debris mitigation."

                    [...] OTV-7 won't be returning to Earth immediately, though:
                    The 29-foot-long space plane still has some more experiments
                    to conduct before heading home. All we know about what's on
                    board is some space domain awareness technology experiments
                    and materials being tested for their reaction to radiation

                    nitrate concentrations at concerning levels.

                    We received responses from over half of the households we
                    surveyed. Of those, just over 8,100 (37%) used private
                    wells.

                      href="https://www.cdc.gov/drinking-water/safety/guidelines-for-testing-well-water.html"
                      >recommends testing annually for nitrate</a
                    >, just 9% of these households had tested their water
                    quality in the past year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More concerning, 40% of this group used their wells for
                    drinking water, had not tested it in the past year, and did
                    not filter the water or use other sources such as bottled
                    water. They were drinking straight from the tap without
                    knowing whether their water was safe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our survey also showed that, despite living in high-risk
                    areas, 77% of households classified their well water quality
                    as "good" or "great." This may be driven by a "not in my
                    backyard" mentality. Households in our survey were more
                    likely to agree with the statement that nitrate is a problem
                    in the state of Iowa than to perceive nitrates as a problem
                    in their local area.

                    [...] As of 2024, just
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41370-024-00645-2"
                      >24 states</a
                    >
                    offered well water testing kits for at least one contaminant
                    that were free or cost $100 or less. And while most states
                    offer information about well water safety, some simply post
                    a brochure online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The upshot is that rural households are bearing the costs
                    associated with unsafe well water, either through health
                    care burdens or spending for treatment and testing.
                    Policymakers have been slow to address the main source of
                    this problem: nitrate pollution from agriculture.

                    In one exception, state agencies in southeastern Minnesota
                    are providing free well water quality testing and offering a

                        Statistical Mechanics is the third pillar of modern
                        physics, next to quantum theory and relativity theory.
                        Its aim is to account for the macroscopic behaviour of
                        physical systems in terms of dynamical laws governing
                        the microscopic constituents of these systems and
                        probabilistic assumptions. Like other theories in
                        physics, statistical mechanics raises a number of
                        foundational and philosophical issues. But philosophical
                        discussions in statistical mechanics face an immediate
                        difficulty because unlike other theories, statistical
                        mechanics has not yet found a generally accepted
                        theoretical framework or a canonical formalism.

                    is evidently invalid, a weaker version—that language
                    influences thought—is much harder to argue against. When we
                    talk about a spaceship, a portmanteau word derived from
                    "[outer] space" and "ship", we bring along certain unstated
                    assumptions about shipping that are at odds with the
                    physical parameters of a human-friendly life support
                    environment for traversing interplanetary distances.
                    <em>Ships</em>, in the vernacular, have
                    <em>captains</em> and a <em>crew</em> who obey the captain
                    via a <em>chain of command</em>, they carry
                    <em>cargo</em> or <em>passengers</em>, they travel between

                    they may have a <em>mission</em> whether it be
                    <em>scientific research</em> or <em>military</em>. And of
                    these aspects, only the scientific research angle is
                    <em>remotely</em> applicable to any actually existing

                    commander, actual direction came from Mission Control back
                    on Earth and the astronauts operated as a team, along lines
                    very similar to those later formalized as

                    <a
                      href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2009/11/the_myth_of_the_starship.html"
                      >a spaceship is not like a sea-going vessel</a
                    >, can't be operated like a sea-going vessel, and the word
                    "ship" in its name feeds into various cognitive biases that
                    may be actively harmful to understanding what it is.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Which leads me to the similar term "space colony": the word
                    <em>colony</em> drags in all sorts of historical baggage,
                    and indeed invokes several models of how an off-Earth
                    outpost might operate, all of which invoke very dangerous
                    cognitive biases!

                    A new paper from Apple's artificial intelligence scientists
                    has found that engines based on large language models, such
                    as those from Meta and OpenAI, still lack basic reasoning
                    skills.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The group
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229">has proposed</a>
                    a new benchmark, GSM-Symbolic, to help others measure the
                    reasoning capabilities of various large language models
                    (LLMs). Their initial testing reveals that slight changes in
                    the wording of queries can result in significantly different
                    answers, undermining the reliability of the models.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The group investigated the "fragility" of mathematical
                    reasoning by adding contextual information to their queries
                    that a human could understand, but which should not affect
                    the fundamental mathematics of the solution. This resulted
                    in varying answers, which shouldn't happen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Specifically, the performance of all models declines [even]
                    when only the numerical values in the question are altered
                    in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark," the group wrote in their
                    report. "Furthermore, the fragility of mathematical
                    reasoning in these models [demonstrates] that their
                    performance significantly deteriorates as the number of
                    clauses in a question increases."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study found that adding even a single sentence that
                    appears to offer relevant information to a given math
                    question can reduce the accuracy of the final answer by up
                    to 65 percent. "There is just no way you can build reliable
                    agents on this foundation, where changing a word or two in
                    irrelevant ways or adding a few bit of irrelevant info can
                    give you a different answer," the study concluded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We found no evidence of formal reasoning in language
                    models," the new study concluded. The behavior of LLMS "is
                    better explained by sophisticated pattern matching" which
                    the study found to be "so fragile, in fact, that [simply]
                    changing names can alter results."

                    Nvidia's latest Blackwell GPUs are experiencing
                    unprecedented demand, with the company reporting that it has
                    sold out of these next-gen processors. Nvidia CEO Jensen
                    Huang revealed the news during an investors

                    hosted by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley Analyst Joe Moore
                    notes that Nvidia executives disclosed that their Blackwell
                    GPU products have a 12-month backlog, echoing a similar
                    situation with Hopper GPUs several quarters ago.

                  <p>
                    The overwhelming demand for Blackwell GPUs comes from
                    Nvidia's traditional customers, including major tech giants
                    like AWS, CoreWeave, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle.
                    These companies have purchased every Blackwell GPU Nvidia
                    and its manufacturing partner TSMC can produce for the next
                    four quarters. The extreme demand indicates that Nvidia's
                    already considerable footprint in the AI processor market
                    should continue to grow next year, even as competition from
                    rivals such as AMD, Intel, and various cloud service
                    providers grab their share.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our view continues to be that Nvidia is likely to gain
                    share of AI processors in 2025, as the biggest users of
                    custom silicon are seeing very steep ramps with Nvidia
                    solutions next year," Moore said in a client note.

                    [...] In August, Nvidia acknowledged that its
                    Blackwell-based products were experiencing low yields,
                    necessitating a re-spin of some layers of the B200 processor
                    to improve production efficiency. Despite these challenges,
                    Nvidia remains confident in its ability to ramp up Blackwell
                    production in Q4 2024. It expects to ship several billion
                    dollars worth of Blackwell GPUs in the last quarter of this
                    year.

                    "confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital

                    Prior to creating the first BBS, Christensen invented
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMODEM">XMODEM</a>, a
                    1977 file transfer protocol that made much of the later BBS
                    world possible by breaking binary files into packets and
                    ensuring that each packet was safely delivered over
                    sometimes unstable and noisy analog telephone lines. It
                    inspired other file transfer protocols that allowed ad-hoc
                    online file sharing to flourish.

                    when they wanted to keep up with their computer club, the
                    Chicago Area Computer Hobbyists' Exchange (CACHE), when
                    physical travel was difficult. Beginning in January of that
                    year, Suess assembled the hardware, and Christensen wrote
                    the software, called
                    <a href="http://software.bbsdocumentary.com/AAA/AAA/CBBS/"

                    "They finished the bulletin board in two weeks but they
                    called it four because they didn't want people to feel that
                    it was rushed and that it was made up," Scott told Ars. They
                    canonically "finished" the project on February 16, 1978, and
                    later wrote about their achievement in a

                  <p>
                    Their new system allowed personal computer owners with
                    modems to dial up a dedicated machine and leave messages
                    that others would see later. The BBS concept represented a
                    digital version of a push-pin bulletin board that might
                    flank a grocery store entrance, town hall, or college dorm
                    hallway.

                    Christensen and Suess openly shared the concept of the BBS,
                    and others began writing their own BBS software. As these
                    programs grew in complexity over time, the often
                    hobbyist-run BBS systems that resulted allowed callers to
                    transfer computer files and

                    BBSes introduced many home computer users to multiplayer
                    online gaming, message boards, and online community building
                    in an era before the Internet became widely available to
                    people outside of science and academia. It also gave rise to

                    band saying, 'Eh, never really got into touring, never
                    really had the urge to record albums or become a rock
                    star,'" Scott said.  "And then later people come and go,
                    'Oh, you made the first [whatever] in your high school
                    band,' but that sense of being at that locus of history and

                    standards provide an opportunity to reduce electronic waste
                    and benefit consumers by specifying a standardized charger
                    for smartphones and similar gadgets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We consider that it would potentially help businesses and
                    deliver consumer and environmental benefits if we were to
                    introduce standardized requirements for chargers for certain
                    portable electrical/electronic devices across the whole UK,"
                    the Office for Product Safety and Standards stated. "We are
                    seeking views from manufacturers, importers, distributors,
                    and trade associations as to whether it would be helpful to
                    do so and, if so, whether this should be based on USB-C – as
                    adopted by the EU."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The aim of the exercise is to help the office understand the
                    potential impact of introducing the measures. It wants
                    feedback of the potential issues and practicalities of
                    having a common charger based on USB-C.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the agency notes that having USB-C as a common
                    charging port should mean that one charger will work for
                    multiple devices. It may also allow manufacturers to
                    "unbundle" the sale of a charger, meaning that consumers
                    have the option to purchase new devices without a charger.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Office for Product Safety and Standards conceded that
                    "manufacturers are likely to adopt a similar approach to the
                    EU Common Charger Directive for the whole of the UK on a
                    voluntary basis in order to avoid supply chain complexity,"
                    and concluded: "As a result, the USB-C charging port is
                    likely to become the industry default."

                    dangers of uncontrolled AGI are real and present. The
                    Clock's current reading—29 minutes to midnight—is a measure
                    of just how close we are to the critical tipping point where
                    uncontrolled AGI could bring about existential risks. While
                    no catastrophic harm has happened yet, the breakneck speed
                    of AI development and the complexities of regulation mean
                    that all stakeholders must stay alert and engaged.

                    sophistication of AI technologies, their increasing
                    autonomy, and their integration with physical systems.

                    The biggest are happening in machine learning and neural

                  <p>
                    What this means is that when a wave strikes this structure,
                    it smashes into the internal geometry, swirls around, and
                    exits with less energy. This effect alone weakens the wave
                    by 70 percent, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers,
                    which tested a scale model in a wave simulator in
                    Mississippi. But the effect should only improve as oysters
                    colonize the structure. Bushek and his team have tried to
                    design the shelves with the right hardness, texture, and
                    shading to entice them.

                    [...] Oysters may suit the DoD's needs in temperate waters,
                    but for bases in tropical climates, it's coral that builds
                    the best seawalls. Hawaii, for instance, enjoys the
                    protection of "fringing" coral reefs that extend offshore
                    for hundreds of yards in a gentle slope along the seabed.
                    The colossal, complex, and porous character of this surface
                    exhausts wave energy over long distances, says Ben Jones, an
                    oceanographer for the Applied Research Laboratory at the
                    University of Hawaii—and head of the university's Reefense
                    project. He said it's not unusual to see ocean swells of 6
                    to 8 feet way offshore, while the water at the seashore laps
                    gently.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Inspired by this effect, Jones and a team of researchers are
                    designing an array that they'll deploy near a US Marine
                    Corps base in Oahu whose shoreline is rapidly receding.
                    While the final design isn't set yet, the broad strokes are:
                    It will feature two 50-meter-wide barriers laid in rows,
                    backed by 20 pyramid-like obstacles. All of these are
                    hollow, thin-walled structures with sloping profiles and
                    lots of big holes. Waves that crash into them will lose
                    energy by crawling up the sides, but two design aspects of
                    the structure—the width of the holes and the thinness of the
                    walls—will generate turbulence in the water, causing it to
                    spin off more energy as heat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the team's full vision, the units are bolstered by about
                    a thousand small coral colonies. Jones' group plans to cover
                    the structures with concrete modules that are about 20
                    inches in diameter. These have grooves and crevices that
                    offer perfect shelters for coral larvae. The team will
                    initially implant them with lab-bred coral. But they're also
                    experimenting with enticements, like light and sound, that
                    help attract coral larvae from the wild—the better to build
                    a wall that nature, not the Pentagon, will tend.

                    A third Reefense team, led by scientists at the University
                    of Miami, takes its inspiration from a different sort of
                    coral. Its design has a three-tiered structure. The
                    foundation is made of long, hexagonal logs punctured with
                    large holes; atop it is a dense layer with smaller
                    holes—"imagine a sponge made of concrete," says Andrew
                    Baker, director of the university's Coral Reef Futures Lab
                    and the Reefense team lead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team thinks these artificial components will soak up
                    plenty of wave energy—but it's a crest of elkhorn coral at
                    the top that will finish the job. Native to Florida, the
                    Bahamas, and the Caribbean, elkhorn like to build dense
                    reefs in shallow-water areas with high-intensity waves. They
                    don't mind getting whacked by water because it helps them
                    harvest food; this whacking keeps wave energy from getting
                    to shore.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Disease has ravaged Florida's elkhorn populations in recent
                    decades, and now ocean heat waves are dealing further
                    damage. But their critical condition has also motivated
                    policymakers to pursue options to save this iconic state
                    species—including Baker's, which is to develop an elkhorn
                    more rugged against disease, higher temperatures, and
                    nastier waves. Under Reefense, Baker says, his lab has
                    developed elkhorn with 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius more heat
                    tolerance than their ancestors. They also claim to have
                    boosted the heat thresholds of symbiotic algae—an
                    existentially important occupant of any healthy reef—and
                    cross-bred local elkhorn with those from Honduras, where
                    reefs have mysteriously withstood scorching waters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Although their client has the largest military budget
                    in the world, the three Reefense teams have been asked to
                    keep an eye on the economics. Darpa has asked that project
                    costs "not greatly exceed" those of conventional solutions,
                    and tasked government monitors with checking the teams'
                    math. Catherine Campbell, Reefense's program manager at
                    Darpa, says affordability doesn't just make it more likely
                    the Pentagon will employ the technology—but that civilians
                    can, too.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This isn't something bespoke for the military ... we need
                    to be in line with those kinds of cost metrics [in the
                    civilian sector]," Campbell said in an email. "And that
                    gives it potential for commercialization."

                advantages and disadvantages:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    According to a traditional system of classification, "high
                    frequency" or HF refers to the radio spectrum between 3 and
                    30 MHz. The label now seems anachronistic, as HF is among
                    the lowest ranges of radio frequencies that see regular use.
                    This setting of the goalposts in the early days of radio
                    technology means that modern communications standards like
                    5G are pushing major applications into the EHF or "extremely
                    high frequency" band. The frontiers of basic radio
                    technology now lie in the terahertz range, where the
                    demarcation between radio waves and light is blurred and the
                    known techniques for both only partially apply. HF, by
                    contrast, is ancient technology. HF emissions can be
                    generated by simple, brute-force means. Ironically, this
                    makes HF a bit difficult: the incredible miniaturization and
                    energy efficiency of modern electronics makes HF radio hard
                    to receive and transmit in a reasonable footprint, one of
                    several reasons that HF radio sees little consumer use.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                HF still has a variety of interesting uses, including some new,
                surprising ones. The signals go beyond the horizon and around
                the curvature of the Earth due to their interaction with parts
                of the atmosphere.

                  <p>
                    A little after 2 PM California time, social media blew up
                    with screenshots showing what the archive.org homepage
                    displayed.
                  </p>
                  <p>It read:</p>

                        Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on
                        sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a
                        catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31

                  <p>
                    HIBP is short for Have I been Pwned, the authoritative site
                    for breach notifications that help people protect their
                    accounts after they've been compromised.

                  <p>
                    The message didn't last long. Soon after it appeared,
                    archive.org, when it loaded at all, displayed a message
                    saying the site was temporarily down. Later, the site
                    returned. Archive.org's Brewster Kahle said on on a social
                    media site that the archive had come under a DDoS attack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, Have I Been Pwnd is reporting that archive.org was
                    hacked. HIBP said the compromise occurred last month and
                    exposed 31 million records containing email addresses,
                    screen names, and bcrypt-hashed passwords.

                    from the North American market. For its residential
                    customers—owners of the popular Juicebox level 2 home
                    chargers—the physical hardware will continue to work, but
                    from tomorrow Enel X will have ended all software support,
                    including updates and its apps. But Enel X also had
                    commercial clients, and they're even more out of luck—from
                    tomorrow those stations "will lose functionality in the
                    absence of software continuity," Enel X
                    <a href="http://www.juiceboxnorthamerica.com/">says</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Juicebox customers, the loss of Enel X's servers and
                    apps isn't great—they will lose the ability to remotely
                    manage the charger, or schedule charging sessions from it.
                    But most electric vehicles—both battery EVs and plug-in
                    hybrid EVs—have their own built-in software to schedule
                    charging sessions, and to hear some owners tell it, Enel X's
                    software was a poor substitute for the original Juicebox
                    software written by eMotorworks, which was bought by Enel X
                    in 2017.

                    [...] Meanwhile, a number of companies and open source

                    As might be expected, lots of charging solution providers
                    are interested in helping Enel X's stranded commercial
                    customers become their newest happy, smiling customers. But
                    it's going to be up to those stranded by Enel X to find a
                    new company and platform to work with.

                    In some cases that might mean migrating existing hardware
                    over, but
                    <a
                      href="https://sustainablecareers.sae.org/article/juicebox-owners-enel-x/"
                      >as SAE notes</a
                    >, Enel X has done little to make that migration simple. And
                    many businesses may find what were functioning level 2
                    chargers today are just beige-colored bricks tomorrow. For
                    example, with Enel X gone, there are no contracts in place
                    for the SIM cards embedded in each charger that provide the
                    connectivity those devices expect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When that goes dead, the only way you can really get those
                    chargers going again is you physically send someone out
                    there, or you ask the person on the property to take out the
                    SIM card, replace it," said Joseph Schottland, CEO of EV+
                    Charging. "It's a big ask, because they've got to get the
                    screwdriver out, take the back of the charger off... They've
                    got to know where to look."

                    Jason Allen—a synthetic media artist whose
                    Midjourney-generated work "Théâtre D'opéra Spatial" went
                    viral and incited backlash after winning a state fair art
                    competition—is not giving up his fight with the US Copyright

                  <p>
                    Last fall, the Copyright Office refused to register Allen's
                    work, claiming that almost the entire work was AI-generated
                    and insisting that copyright registration requires more
                    human authorship than simply plugging a prompt into
                    Midjourney.

                  <p>
                    Allen is now appealing that decision, asking for judicial
                    review and alleging that "the negative media attention
                    surrounding the Work may have influenced the Copyright
                    Office Examiner's perception and judgment." He claims that
                    the Examiner was biased and considered "improper factors"
                    such as the public backlash when concluding that he had "no
                    control over how the artificial intelligence tool analyzed,
                    interpreted, or responded to these prompts."

                A working Turing Machine was submitted to Lego Ideas, consisting
                of approximately 2,900 parts and a bucketload of extreme
                cleverness. The Lego builder first came across the concept a few
                years ago and, despite it being an abstract model, decided to
                attempt making one out of the plastic components of Lego
                Technic.

                Talking to <i>El Reg</i>, the submitter "The Bananaman" stated:
                "My first few ideas [on] how to do this would be very big and
                inefficient if they were ever [to be] built, but I usually
                stopped developing them very early. The first one that could
                possibly work was three years ago and I built a part of the tape
                with the symbol reader and a very bad unfinished prototype of
                the 'truth table' that would use a 32-speed gearbox instead of
                the 'searching' mechanism. Later I realized that the 'truth
                table' can be made way more easily (it was my fourth idea on how
                to build the table and it still had a dozen revisions later on),
                and I came up with using the registers which made everything
                easier. I started building the prototype last vacation, then
                took a break and I've finished it this vacation."

                There was also the challenge of fitting into the limits imposed
                by Lego Ideas. At the time of submission, this was 3,000 parts,
                and The Bananaman's contraption finally managed to come in at
                around 2,900. The limit has since been raised to 5,000 parts.
                Should it get to 10,000 supporters on the Lego Ideas site, it
                will go into Expert Review, where Lego's professionals will
                decide if it should be approved for production. The evaluation
                will depend on a range of criteria, including feasibility and
                strength of idea.

                    Governor Gavin Newsom over the weekend signed into law a
                    bill amending the California Consumer Privacy Act, the
                    state's spin on the GDPR in Europe, to classify "neural
                    data" as protected personal information along the lines of
                    precise geolocation, genetics and biometrics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Neurorights Foundation medical director Sean Pauzauskie
                    called the Califoria law "an enormous victory" for patients
                    suffering from mental health disorders as well as for
                    consumers simply looking to enhance their lives with new
                    technologies.
                  </p>
                  <p>The NGO co-sponsored the bill with a state senator.</p>
                  <p>
                    "The essential privacy guardrails it ensures should only
                    boost confidence in all varieties of these revolutionary
                    neurotechnologies, the great majority which are based in
                    California," Pauzauskie said in a release.

                    California is the second state to extend data protections to
                    brainwaves, on the heels of Colorado putting in place a law
                    requiring privacy safeguards along the lines of what is done
                    for fingerprints.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The California law sends "a clear signal to the fast-growing
                    neurotechnology industry" to protect people's mental
                    privacy, NeuroRights Foundation general counsel Jared Genser
                    said in a release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Protections under the California law include the right to
                    know what brain data is being collected, limit its
                    disclosure, and to be able to opt-out or have it deleted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The law applies to devices capable of recording or altering
                    nervous system activity, whether they be implanted or worn,
                    the NGO said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The potential for devices to tap into how people feel or
                    think has raised concerns they could be used to manipulate
                    feelings or thoughts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In the coming years, the sensitivity of neural data will
                    increase alongside surging investments...resulting in
                    increased resolution of brain scans and larger datasets of
                    brain data being collected," the NGO predicted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Meanwhile generative artificial intelligence will continue
                    accelerating the ability to accurately decode these scans."

                    TV and streaming stick manufacturers and streaming service
                    providers, have developed a "surveillance system" that has
                    "long undermined privacy and consumer protection," according
                    to a report from the Center for Digital Democracy (CDD)
                    published today and sent to the Federal Trade Commission
                    (FTC). Unprecedented tracking techniques aimed at pleasing
                    advertisers have resulted in connected TVs (CTVs) being a
                    "privacy nightmare," according to Jeffrey Chester, report

                    Getting into arguments with strangers online or family
                    members at the dinner table can feel a bit like debating
                    with a brick wall. We are probably all guilty of feeling
                    like we are right, even if we don't have all the facts.
                    According to a recent psychology study, people tend to
                    assume that they have all of the information that they need
                    to make a decision or support their position–even if they
                    don't. This phenomenon dubbed the "illusion of information
                    adequacy" is detailed in a study published October 9 in the
                    journal PLoS ONE.
                  </p>

                    "Interpersonal conflict is on the rise, driving increases in
                    anger, anxiety, and general stress," Angus Fletcher, a study
                    co-author and narrative theorist and neurophysiologist at
                    the Ohio State University, tells Popular Science. "We wanted
                    to look into those misunderstandings and see if they could
                    be mitigated."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team calls this belief that we are correct–even when we
                    don't have all of the information–<b

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fletcher describes the illusion of adequacy as, "The less
                    that our brain knows, the more confident it is that it knows
                    all it needs to know. This makes us prone to thinking that
                    we have all the crucial facts about a decision, leaping to
                    confident conclusions and decisive judgments, when we are
                    missing necessary information."

                    Before you can write an exploit, you need a bug. When there
                    are no bugs, we have to get creative—that's where Fault
                    Injection comes in. Fault injection can take many forms,
                    including software-controlled data corruption, power
                    glitching, clock glitching, electromagnetic pulses, lasers,
                    and more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hardware fault injection is something that typically
                    requires specialized (and expensive) equipment. The costs
                    stem from requiring a high degree of precision in terms of
                    both when and where the fault is injected. There are many
                    valiant attempts at bringing down the costs, with notable
                    projects ranging from the RP2040-based PicoEMP, all the way
                    to "Laser Fault Injection for The Masses". (The RP2040 crops
                    up a lot due to its low cost combined with the "PIO"
                    peripheral, which can do I/O with tight timings and latency)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A while back I read about using a piezo-electric BBQ Igniter
                    coupled to an inductor as a low-budget tool for
                    electro-magnetic fault injection (EMFI), and I was
                    captivated. I wondered, how far can you take such a
                    primitive tool? At the time, the best thing I could come up
                    with was exploiting a software implementation of AES running
                    on an Arduino, using DFA—it worked!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But I wasn't fully satisfied. I wanted to exploit something
                    more "real," but I was out of ideas for the time being....

                Amazon plans to show more ads on Prime Video in 2025 to test how
                much viewers can handle. Even though some subscribers may not
                like ads, Amazon has not seen a big drop in customers since
                adding them. By adding more commercials and shoppable ads,
                Amazon is trying to see how much ads people will tolerate while
                watching their favorite shows.

                    As for the conversion, it looks fairly well-executed, though
                    it does make the Cayenne look somewhat like a sea mammal
                    with wheels. It's weird, but we don't hate it. It's unclear
                    how long it took West Coast Customs to do the conversion or
                    how much it cost, though we assume the answer is "a long

                It's bad enough that Porsche took a turn to the ordinary when
                they started making SUVs, as a cash grab to suppliment their
                traditional expertise in sports and racing cars. But a minivan
                is a step too far...

                    Starting a new car company isn't easy—just ask Henrik
                    Fisker, whose second bite at that particular cherry ended
                    the same way as his first when it filed for bankruptcy this
                    July. At the time, Fisker said it wanted to try to "preserve
                    certain customer programs," but Ars wondered what this
                    actually meant, particularly now that electric vehicles are
                    so dependent on software support and cloud connectivity.
                    Now, thanks to a recent court filing spotted by TechCrunch,
                    we know the answer: nothing good.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Car publications were already warning consumers to steer
                    clear of the Ocean as early as this March, despite massive
                    price cuts that saw these electric SUVs being offered for
                    less than $25,000. A New York-based company called American
                    Lease was less deterred by this warning and in June agreed
                    to purchase the remaining Fisker inventory—approximately
                    3,300 cars for a total of $46.3 million dollars. By October,
                    American Lease had paid Fisker $42.5 million and had taken
                    delivery of about 1,100 Oceans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That was the plan until the end of last week, at least. Last
                    Friday evening, Fisker informed American Lease that the
                    Oceans "cannot, as a technical matter, be 'ported' from the
                    Fisker server to which the vehicles are currently linked to
                    a distinct server owned and/or controlled by" American
                    Lease.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] American Lease says it "cannot overstate the
                    significance of this unwelcome news," particularly since it
                    had already paid Fisker the vast majority of the agreed
                    price. American Lease is also more than a little unhappy
                    that the news was delivered a few days before a court
                    hearing scheduled for today and says it's unclear how long
                    Fisker has known that its cars cannot be ported to a new
                    server.

                      <p>
                        John Hopfield invented a network that uses a method for
                        saving and recreating patterns. We can imagine the nodes
                        as pixels. The Hopfield network utilises physics that
                        describes a material's characteristics due to its atomic
                        spin – a property that makes each atom a tiny magnet.
                        The network as a whole is described in a manner
                        equivalent to the energy in the spin system found in
                        physics, and is trained by finding values for the
                        connections between the nodes so that the saved images
                        have low energy. When the Hopfield network is fed a
                        distorted or incomplete image, it methodically works
                        through the nodes and updates their values so the
                        network's energy falls. The network thus works stepwise
                        to find the saved image that is most like the imperfect
                        one it was fed with.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Geoffrey Hinton used the Hopfield network as the
                        foundation for a new network that uses a different
                        method: the Boltzmann machine. This can learn to
                        recognise characteristic elements in a given type of
                        data. Hinton used tools from statistical physics, the
                        science of systems built from many similar components.
                        The machine is trained by feeding it examples that are
                        very likely to arise when the machine is run. The
                        Boltzmann machine can be used to classify images or
                        create new examples of the type of pattern on which it
                        was trained. Hinton has built upon this work, helping
                        initiate the current explosive development of machine
                        learning.

                    performance. Over the weekend, 16-year-old Michael
                    "dogplayingtetris" Artiaga became the first to reach an even
                    more impressive plateau in the game,
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXhbti5SneE"

                    and instantly rolling the game all the way back to the
                    ultra-slow Level 0.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It took Artiaga a bit over 80 minutes and a full 3,300
                    cleared lines to finally achieve the game's first
                    near-mythical "rebirth"
                    <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2268738212"
                      >live in front of hundreds of Twitch viewers</a
                    >.<br />[...]<br />Artiaga's record does come with a small
                    asterisk since he used a version of the game that was
                    modified to avoid the crashes that stopped Blue Scuti's
                    historic run.<br />[...]<br />NES Tetris was never designed
                    for play past Level 29, though, which means unintended
                    glitches start to get in the way of any truly endless Tetris
                    sessions. At Level 138,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Lp2yA2wYKI&amp;t=0s"
                      >a memory overflow error</a
                    >
                    causes the Tetris pieces to show up in some increasingly
                    funky colors, including palettes that are incredibly hard to
                    make out at Levels 146 and 148.<br />[...]<br />Even with a
                    modified game, though, Artiaga faced another massive
                    mountain of a glitch before he could achieve rebirth: Level
                    235. While the Tetris Level counter usually cycles every 10
                    lines,
                    <a
                      href="https://cohost.org/rgmechex/post/5264863-rgme-article-33-81"
                      >vagaries of the game's binary-coded decimal line
                      counter</a
                    >
                    cause the level count to get stuck on 235 for a whopping 810
                    lines. To make matters worse, the Level 235 glitched color
                    palette is a dull green that is hard to see against the
                    game's black background, making the level a true test of
                    endurance.<br />[...]<br />Artiaga—who started playing
                    high-level Tetris competitively at the age of 10 in 2019—has
                    won the Classic Tetris World Championship two times, in
                    addition to setting multiple records in the game and
                    dominating many smaller tournaments. Despite all that, he
                    said during his stream that "this is the best thing I've
                    ever done in Tetris, bro."<br />[...]<br />"Oh my god, I'm
                    so glad that game is over, bro," Artiaga said on stream. "I
                    never want to play this game again, bro... I was starting to
                    lose my mind."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now that the Tetris rebirth has been proven humanly possible
                    (with crash-avoidance mods, at least), the community will no
                    doubt move on to see who, if anyone, can complete a double
                    rebirth in a single uninterrupted Tetris session.<br />[...]<br />One
                    thing's for sure: The classic Tetris scene has certainly
                    come a long way since the days of the Level 29 "kill
                    screen."

                    Concern about deceptively edited photos feels like a very
                    modern anxiety, yet a century ago similar worries were being
                    litigated...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Portrait photography gave rise to an industry of photo
                    'retouching' – analog 'beauty filters' – to flatter subjects
                    in a way portrait painters once did. This trend lead to
                    questions about technology distorting our perceptions of
                    beauty, reality and truth:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other commercial applications of photo retouching emerged:
                    in 1911 tourists visiting Washington D.C. could acquire fake
                    photographs of themselves posing with then President of the
                    United States William Taft. This troubled Government
                    officials. Upon discovering the practice in 1911, a United
                    States Attorney ordered it stopped.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The following year a fugitive - wanted for people
                    trafficking - was found in possession of a fake photo posing
                    with President Taft, it was reported he'd used it to buy the
                    trust of his victims:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That this seemingly benign practice had been weaponized
                    prompted some to demand it be regulated against abuse. The
                    justice department prepared a law, that was introduced by
                    then Senator Henry Cabot Lodge - who'd similarly been
                    troubled after reportedly finding a photograph of himself
                    with someone he'd never met.

                    NERD HARDER! has been the answer ever since CALEA – and
                    related Clinton-era initiatives, like the failed Clipper
                    Chip program, which would have put a spy chip in every
                    computer, and, eventually, every phone and gadget:

                    America may have invented NERD HARDER! but plenty of other
                    countries have taken up the cause. The all-time champion is
                    former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who, when
                    informed that the laws of mathematics dictate that it is
                    impossible to make an encryption scheme that only protects
                    good secrets and not bad ones, replied, "The laws of
                    mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that
                    applies in Australia is the law of Australia":

                    CALEA forced a redesign of the foundational, physical layer
                    of the internet. Thankfully, encryption at the protocol
                    layer – in the programs we use – partially counters this
                    deliberately introduced brittleness in the security of all
                    our communications. CALEA can be used to intercept your
                    communications, but mostly what an attacker gets is
                    "metadata" ("so-and-so sent a message of X bytes to such and
                    such") because the data is scrambled and they can't
                    unscramble it, because cryptography actually <em>works</em>,
                    unlike back doors. Of course, that's why governments in the
                    EU, the US, the UK and all over the world are
                    <em>still</em> trying to ban working encryption, insisting
                    that the back doors they'll install will only let the good
                    guys in:

                    <em>Any</em> back door can be exploited by your adversaries.
                    The Chinese sponsored hacking group know as Salt Typhoon
                    intercepted the communications of hundreds of millions of
                    American residents, businesses, and institutions. From that
                    position, they could do NSA-style metadata-analysis, malware
                    injection, and interception of unencrypted traffic. And they
                    <em>didn't have to hack anything</em>, because the US
                    government insists that all networking gear ship
                    <em>pre-hacked</em> so that cops can get into it.

                    This isn't even the first time that CALEA back doors have
                    been exploited by a hostile foreign power as a matter of
                    geopolitical skullduggery. In 2004-2005, Greece's
                    telecommunications were under mass surveillance by US spy
                    agencies who wiretapped Greek officials, all the way up to
                    the Prime Minister, in order to mess with the Greek Olympic
                    bid:

                    This is a wild story in <em>so many</em> ways. For one
                    thing, CALEA isn't law in Greece! You can totally sell
                    working, secure networking gear in Greece, and in many other
                    countries around the world where they have not passed a
                    stupid CALEA-style law. <em>However</em> the US telecoms
                    market is so fucking <em>huge</em> that all the
                    manufacturers build CALEA back doors into their gear, no
                    matter where it's destined for. So the US has effectively
                    exported this deliberate insecurity to the whole planet –
                    and used it to screw around with <em>Olympic bids</em>, the
                    most penny-ante bullshit imaginable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now Chinese-sponsored hackers with cool names like "Salt
                    Typhoon" are traipsing around inside US telecoms
                    infrastructure, using the back doors the FBI insisted would
                    be safe.

                    Then, according to Knowledge Stew, the Air Force brought in
                    a crashed F-101A Voodoo, an aircraft that had been out of
                    service with the Air Force since 1972 and with the Air
                    National Guard since 1982. The crashed Voodoo had been in
                    storage at the secretive Area 51 in Nevada for more than 20
                    years, and it was broken up and put in place of the F-117
                    debris. Almost a month later, the Air Force said the area
                    was no longer restricted.

                    If anyone was in any doubt, the notification spells it out:
                    "Cisco will be exiting the LoRaWAN space. There is no
                    planned migration for Cisco LoRaWAN gateways."

                  <p>
                    The move will come as a blow for any organizations that have
                    built IoT deployments using LoRaWAN that may have considered
                    Cisco to be a safe and dependable supplier. The networking
                    colossus was pushing new products as

                      >recently as last year</a
                    >, when it announced a pluggable interface module (PIM) for

                  <p>
                    LoRaWAN is a low power, wide area network specification,
                    specifically designed to connect devices such as sensors
                    over relatively long distances. It is built on LoRa, a form
                    of wireless communication that uses spread spectrum
                    modulation, and makes use of license-free sub-gigahertz
                    industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio bands. The
                    tech is overseen by the
                    <a href="https://lora-alliance.org/">LoRa Alliance</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] One analyst we spoke to who covers the IoT space said
                    this likely isn't a profitable part of the business as far
                    as Cisco is concerned. Since LoRa has a long range, fewer
                    gateways are required than in Wi-Fi deployments, for
                    example, and there are many vendors making LoRa sensors and
                    hardware, resulting in a competitive market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Exiting the LoRaWAN market is probably part of a more
                    focused look at networking, paring away areas where they
                    either weren't dominant, they don't see growth potential or
                    that isn't in line with their overall networking roadmap."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Any Cisco LoRaWAN customers can perhaps take comfort from
                    the fact that the final date to receive applicable service
                    and support as stipulated in active service contracts is
                    December 31, 2029. However, the last date that Cisco
                    Engineering may release a planned maintenance release or
                    software patch is much nearer – December 31, 2026.

                a factor in the potential for a severe geomagnetic storm.

                One of the main questions that we can't answer until the CME
                gets to within about a million miles of Earth is the orientation
                of its magnetic field.

                concerned about the possibility of viewing auroras or potential
                disruptions to the power grid, so hopefully some of the comments
                can explain a bit more about what it means. I don't know a whole
                lot about space weather, but I'll try to offer a cursory
                explanation of what I believe some of it means.

                the sun) of solar wind plasma. A higher plasma density or a
                faster radial velocity should result in a stronger geomagnetic
                storm. This is also useful for estimating when a CME will reach
                Earth. I believe the

                is used to measure how much the Earth's magnetic field is
                compressed or stretched and can identify the onset of
                geomagnetic storms. The

                >
                data are satellite-derived measurements of the solar wind. In
                addition to showing the plasma speed, temperature, and density,
                the Bz and Phi variables show the orientation of the magnetic
                field in the solar wind. If Bz is positive, it's a
                northward-oriented magnetic field. However, a negative Bz
                indicates a southward-oriented magnetic field, the opposite
                direction of Earth's magnetic field, and this can result in more
                severe geomagnetic storms. Basically, a strongly negative Bz
                around -10 or even -20 would be more favorable for a strong
                geomagnetic storm. The aurora forecast is a short-term forecast
                (~30 minutes to an hour) of the probability of auroral activity
                over a location, though auroras may be visible near the horizon
                in areas equatorward of what the forecast shows.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's a lot of data on NOAA's space weather dashboard that can
                be useful for anyone hoping to see the auroras. My understanding
                of space weather is very limited, so if anyone else has a better
                understanding of what the data means, please share the
                information in the comments. Although a G4 or even a G5
                geomagnetic storm is possible, but there's still a lot of
                uncertainty until the CME gets very close to Earth.

                    [...] Although only a simulation, the outcome of the
                    experiment suggests that using a nuclear X-ray pulse on an
                    asteroid could potentially change its trajectory enough to
                    prevent a collision with the Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I knew right away that this was a huge success," said
                    Moore.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is a significant difference between planting a nuclear
                    bomb on an asteroid and directing a nuclear X-ray pulse to
                    part of an asteroid to nudge it onto a different trajectory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If a space agency were to successfully detonate a nuclear
                    bomb on an asteroid, scientists have cautioned that the
                    asteroid would be likely to break into smaller chunks,
                    potentially causing multiple asteroid impacts on Earth
                    instead of just one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even if the trajectory of the biggest chunk of the asteroid
                    was changed, there would be no guarantee that the other
                    fragments of the asteroid would travel away from Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using an X-ray pulse, scientists can generate energy to
                    vapourise enough material from the surface of the asteroid
                    to result in a push that would change the trajectory of the
                    asteroid rather than blasting it into smaller fragments.

                    The legal saga over Martin Shkreli's infamous 5,000 percent
                    price hike of a life-saving anti-parasitic drug has ended
                    with a flat denial from the highest court in the land.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Monday, the Supreme Court rejected Shkreli's petition to
                    appeal an order to return $64.6 million in profits from the
                    pricing scheme of Daraprim, a decades-old drug used to treat
                    toxoplasmosis. The condition is caused by a single-celled
                    parasite that can be deadly for newborns and people with
                    compromised immune systems, such as people who have HIV,
                    cancer, or an organ transplant.<br />[...]<br />In a lawsuit
                    filed in 2021, the Federal Trade Commission and seven state
                    attorneys general accused Shkreli of building a "web of
                    anticompetitive restrictions to box out the competition." In
                    January of 2022, US District Court Judge Denise Cote agreed,
                    finding that Shkreli's conduct was "<a

                    Cotes banned Shkreli from the pharmaceutical industry for
                    life and found him liable for $64.6 million in disgorgement.

                    compiled by Jon Peddie Research (JPR) reveals a significant
                    surge in global AIB [add-in board] volumes, up 47.9 percent
                    year-on-year to 9.5 million units and up 9.4 percent

                    Yet since Intel introduced its first dedicated AIB – or
                    graphics card – via the
                    <a

                    >
                    microarchitecture in March 2022, the company has seemingly
                    failed to capture meaningful market share from either Nvidia
                    or AMD, at least according to JPR.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When Intel first teased its Arc GPUs, there was a lot
                    of buzz. Could Chipzilla translate its experience in
                    processors to AIBs and perform as well in the dedicated
                    graphics market as it has elsewhere?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On launch, the company talked a big game about disrupting
                    the duopoly of Nvidia and AMD. Intel promised its products
                    would be affordable and competitive, with options for
                    gamers, creators, and enterprise users. Just over two years
                    in, the reality hasn't lived up to the hype. Intel has
                    suffered some technical setbacks, including driver
                    instability and immaturity, which is a given for a new
                    player in the market. The other stumbling block is
                    performance related, although Intel has consistently
                    released new driver updates looking to address this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From here, Intel's movement into the AIB market seems to
                    have been a dud, particularly considering the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/23/intel_apollo_investment/"
                      >company's poor financial position</a
                    >
                    and

                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/27/arm_intel_takeover/"
                      >rivals expressing interest in acquiring assets</a
                    >. If Intel can't even dent a full percentile of AMD's
                    market share, it seemingly doesn't stand a chance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unless Intel can recapture some of that earlier buzz with
                    the upcoming Battlemage AIBs between now and the end of
                    2025, its goal of being a major player in dedicated graphics
                    appears more likely to be a pipe dream.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Intel needs to focus on its pedigree in microprocessors
                    rather than trying to enter a market locked down by Nvidia
                    because the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/26/intel_0x12b_raptor_lake/"

                      families</a
                    >
                    haven't done its reputation any favors. Nvidia's dominance
                    in the broader graphics market looks unlikely to change as
                    we enter the age of AI, nor will its chokehold on the AIB
                    industry, at least not any time soon.
