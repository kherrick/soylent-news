                    U.S. authorities have dismantled a massive botnet run by
                    hackers backed by the Chinese government, according to a
                    speech given by FBI director Christopher Wray on Wednesday.
                    The botnet malware infected a number of different types of
                    internet-connected devices around the world, including home
                    routers, cameras, digital video recorders, and NAS drives.
                    Those devices were used to help infiltrate sensitive
                    networks related to universities, government agencies,
                    telecommunications providers, and media organizations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wray explained the operation at the
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mmVUVp3iJ8o"
                      >Aspen Digital</a
                    >
                    conference and said the hackers work for a Beijing-based
                    company called Integrity Technology Group, which is known to
                    U.S. researchers as Flax Typhoon. The botnet was launched in
                    mid-2021, according to the FBI, and infected roughly 260,000
                    devices as of June 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The operation to dismantle the botnet was coordinated by the
                    FBI, the NSA, and the Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF),
                    according to a press release dated
                    <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2024/240918.pdf"
                      >Wednesday</a
                    >. The U.S. Department of Justice received a court order to
                    take control of the botnet infrastructure by sending
                    disabling commands to the malware on infected devices. The
                    hackers tried to counterattack by hitting FBI infrastructure
                    but were "ultimately unsuccessful," according to the law
                    enforcement agency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    About half of the devices hijacked were in the U.S.,
                    according to Wray, but there were also devices identified as
                    compromised in South America, Europe, Africa, Southeast
                    Asia, and Australia. And the DOJ noted in a press release
                    that authorities in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the
                    UK all helped take down the botnet.

                    New Starlink customers have to pay a $100 "congestion
                    charge" in areas where the satellite broadband network has
                    limited capacity.

                    says. "This fee will only apply if you are purchasing or
                    activating a new service plan. If you change your Service
                    address or Service Plan at a later date, you may be charged

                  <p>
                    The charge is unwelcome for anyone wanting Starlink service
                    in a congested area, but it could help prevent the capacity
                    crunch from getting worse by making people think twice about
                    signing up. The SpaceX-owned Internet service provider also
                    seems to anticipate that people who sign up for service in
                    congested areas may change their minds after trying it out
                    for a few weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our intention is to no longer charge this fee to new
                    customers as soon as network capacity improves. If you're
                    not satisfied with Starlink and return it within the 30-day
                    return window, the charge will be refunded," the company
                    said.

                    Since its founding in 1954, high-energy physics laboratory
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a> has
                    been a flagship for international scientific collaboration.
                    That commitment has been under strain since the Russian
                    invasion of Ukraine in 2022. CERN decided to cut ties with
                    Moscow late last year over deaths resulting from the
                    country's "unlawful use of force" in the ongoing conflict.

                    With the existing international cooperation agreements now
                    lapsing, the Geneva-based organization is expected to expel
                    hundreds of scientists on November 30 affiliated with
                    Russian institutions,

                    Institute for Nuclear Research, an intergovernmental center
                    near Moscow.

                    CERN was founded in the wake of World War II as a place
                    dedicated to the peaceful pursuit of science. The
                    organization currently has 24 member states and, in 2019
                    alone, hosted about 12,400 users from institutions in more
                    than 70 countries. Russia has never been a full member of
                    CERN, but collaborations first began in 1955, with hundreds
                    of Russia-affiliated scientists contributing to experiments
                    in the ensuing decades. Now, that 60-year history of
                    collaboration, and Russia's long-standing observer status,
                    is ending. As World Nuclear News

                    The decision to end the cooperation agreement was taken in
                    December 2023 when CERN's Council passed a resolution "to
                    terminate the International Cooperation Agreement between
                    CERN and the Russian Federation, together with all related
                    protocols and addenda, with effect from 30 November 2024; To
                    terminate ... all other agreements and experiment memoranda
                    of understanding allowing the participation of the Russian
                    Federation and its national institutes in the CERN
                    scientific programme, with effect from 30 November 2024;
                    AFFIRMS That these measures concern the relationship between
                    CERN and Russian and Belarusian institutes and do not affect
                    the relationship with scientists of Russian nationality
                    affiliated with other institutes." The cooperation agreement
                    with Belarus will come to an end on 27 June, before the
                    Russian one ends.

                  <p>
                    It's unclear how this decision will impact scientific
                    research at CERN. Russia's 4.5 percent contribution to the
                    combined budget for ongoing experiments at the Large Hadron
                    Collider has already been covered by other collaboration
                    members. Some think the effects will be minimal since
                    researchers have had plenty of time to prepare for the exit.
                    Certain essential staff members have successfully found
                    employment outside of Russia so that they can stay on.

                    Others are less confident. “It will leave a hole. I think
                    it’s an illusion to believe one can cover that very simply

                    The Arc browser's 'Boosts' feature would've allowed bad
                    actors to edit a website and add a malicious payload that
                    their target could download to their computer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the feature that separates the Arc browser from its
                    competitors is the ability to customize websites. The
                    feature called "Boosts" allows users to change a website's
                    background color, switch to a font they like or one that
                    makes it easier for them to read and even remove an unwanted
                    elements from the page completely. Their alterations aren't
                    supposed to be be visible to anyone else, but they can share
                    them across devices. Now, Arc's creator, the Browser
                    Company, has admitted that a security researcher found a
                    serious flaw that would've allowed attackers to use Boosts
                    to compromise their targets' systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company used Firebase, which the security researcher
                    known as "xyzeva" described as a "database-as-a-backend
                    service" in their post about the vulnerability, to support
                    several Arc features. For Boosts, in particular, it's used
                    to share and sync customizations across devices. In xyzeva's
                    post, they showed how the browser relies on a creator's
                    identification (creatorID) to load Boosts on a device. They
                    also shared how someone could change that element to their
                    target's identification tag and assign that target Boosts
                    that they had created.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If a bad actor makes a Boost with a malicious payload, for
                    instance, they can just change their creatorID to the
                    creatorID of their intended target. When the intended victim
                    then visits the website on Arc, they could unknowingly
                    download the hacker's malware. And as the researcher
                    explained, it's pretty easy to get user IDs for the browser.
                    A user who refer someone to Arc will share their ID to the
                    recipient, and if they also created an account from a
                    referral, the person who sent it will also get their ID.
                    Users can also share their Boosts with others, and Arc has a
                    page with public Boosts that contain the creatorIDs of the
                    people who made them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In its post, the Browser Company said xyzeva notified it
                    about the security issue on August 25 and that it issued a
                    fix a day later with the researcher's help.

                    Google employees were well aware of how their written words
                    could be used against the company, the DOJ argued, pointing
                    to the company's "Communicate with Care" legal training for
                    employees. In one 2019 email, Srinivasan copied a lawyer on
                    an email to colleagues about an ad tech feature and reminded
                    the group to be careful with their language. "We should be
                    particularly careful when framing something as a
                    'circumvention,'" he wrote. "We should assume that every
                    document (and email) we generate will likely be seen by
                    regulators." The email was labeled "PRIVILEGED and
                    CONFIDENTIAL."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the many documents shown by the DOJ demonstrate that
                    Google often discussed business decisions in writing, at
                    other times, they seemed to intentionally leave the
                    documentation sparse. "Keeping the notes limited due to
                    sensitivity of the subject," a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We take seriously our obligations to preserve and produce
                    relevant documents," Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels
                    said in a statement. "We have for years responded to
                    inquiries and litigation, and we educate our employees about
                    legal privilege. In the DOJ cases alone, we have produced
                    millions of documents including chat messages and documents
                    not covered by legal privilege."

                    The Linux kernel is 33 years old. Its creator, Linus
                    Torvalds, still enjoys an argument or two but is baffled why
                    the debate over Rust has attracted so much heat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I'm not sure why Rust has been such a contentious area,"
                    Torvalds said during
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/OM_8UOPFpqE?feature=shared"

                    this week with Dirk Hohndel, Verizon's Head of Open Source.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It reminds me of when I was young and people were arguing
                    about vi versus Emacs," said the software engineer. Hohndel
                    interjected, "They still are!"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Torvalds laughed, "Maybe they still are! But for some
                    reason, the whole Rust versus C discussion has taken almost
                    religious overtones."

                    Getting Rust into the Linux kernel has been a hot topic for
                    some time.

                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/16/rust_in_the_linux_kernel/"
                      >In 2022</a
                    >, developers were arguing over the language, with some
                    calling the memory safety features of Rust an "insult" to
                    some of the hard work that had gone into the kernel over the
                    years. At the beginning of September, one of the maintainers
                    of the Rust for Linux projects

                  <p>
                    During the conversation at the Linux Foundation's Open
                    Source Summit in Vienna this week, Torvalds continued,
                    "Clearly, there are people who just don't like the notion of
                    Rust, and having Rust encroach on their area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "People have even been talking about the Rust integration
                    being a failure … We've been doing this for a couple of
                    years now so it's way too early to even say that, but I also
                    think that even if it were to become a failure – and I don't
                    think it will – that's how you learn," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "So I see the whole Rust thing as positive, even if the
                    arguments are not necessarily always [so]."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Keen to pull those positives from the row, Torvalds added,
                    "One of the nice parts about Rust has been how it's livened
                    up discussions," before acknowledging, "some of the
                    arguments get nasty, and people do actually - yes - decide
                    'this is not worth my time,' but at the same time it's kind
                    of interesting, and I think it shows how much people care."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "C is, in the end, a very simple language. It's one of the
                    reasons I enjoy C and why a lot of C programmers enjoy C,
                    even if the other side of that picture is obviously that
                    because it's simple it's also very easy to make mistakes,"
                    he argued.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With impressive diplomacy, considering his

                    >
                    of years past, Torvalds went on, "There's a lot of people
                    who are used to the C model, and they don't necessarily like
                    the differences... and that's ok.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Some people care about specific architectures, and some
                    people like file systems, and that's how it should be.
                    That's how I see Rust."

                    X's lawyers said in a Friday court filing cited by the Times
                    that X complied with the orders asking the social network to
                    remove accounts accused of engaging in disinformation, as
                    well as demands from the Supreme Court regarding fines and
                    the assignment of a new legal representative for X in
                    Brazil. The Brazilian Supreme Court confirmed the compliance
                    in its own filing Saturday, though it noted X has yet to
                    file the proper documents to move forward with its case and
                    will have five days to do so, the Times reported. André
                    Zonaro Giacchetta, one of X's new lawyers in Brazil, told
                    the Times the conditions for X's return in Brazil "have
                    already been met, but it depends on the assessment of" the
                    country's supreme court.

                  <p>
                    Like many people who solder regularly, I decided years ago
                    to upgrade from a basic iron and invest in a soldering
                    station. My RadioShack digital station has served me well
                    for the better part of 20 years. It heats up fast, tips are
                    readily available, and it's a breeze to dial in whatever
                    temperature I need. It's older than both of my children, has
                    moved with me to three different homes, and has outlived two
                    cars and one marriage (so far, anyway).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As such, when the new breed of "smart" USB-C soldering irons
                    started hitting the scene, I didn't find them terribly
                    compelling. Oh sure, I bought a Pinecil. But that's because
                    I'm an unrepentant open source zealot and love the idea that
                    there's a soldering iron running a community developed
                    firmware. In practice though, I only used the thing a few
                    times, and even then it was because I needed something
                    portable. Using it at home on the workbench? It just never
                    felt up to the task of daily use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So when iFixit got in contact a couple weeks back and said
                    they had a prototype USB-C soldering iron they wanted me to
                    take a look at, I was skeptical to say the least. But then I
                    started reading over the documentation they sent over, and
                    couldn't deny that they had some interesting ideas. For one,
                    it was something of a hybrid iron. It was portable when you
                    needed it to be, yet offered the flexibility and power of a
                    station when you were at the bench.

                    On Tuesday, Chief US District Judge Robert Shelby granted a

                    from limiting the social media usage of minors. Republican
                    Governor Spencer Cox had signed the Utah Minor Protection in
                    Social Media Act earlier in March. It was supposed to take
                    effect on October 1, but the court’s decision to block the
                    law is a victory for young social media users in Utah.

                  <p>
                    Under the law, social media companies would have been forced
                    to verify the age of all users. If a minor registers for an
                    account, they are subject to various limitations. The
                    content they share would be seen only by connected accounts.
                    Additionally, minor accounts could not be searched for or
                    messaged by non-followers or friends, effectively
                    nonexistent to strangers.

                    Since at least Aristotle, writers and scholars have debated
                    what makes for a great story. One of them is

                    professor of marketing at the University of Toronto's Rotman
                    School of Management. With a scientist's tools, he's done
                    what previous theorizers have failed to: put theory to the
                    test and demonstrate the key factor for empirically
                    predicting which stories will be snore fests and which will
                    leave audiences hungry for more.

                    It turns out to be "narrative reversals" -- lots of them and
                    the bigger the better. Commonly known as changes of fortune
                    or turning points, where characters' fortunes swing from
                    good to bad and vice versa, Prof. Knight and fellow
                    researchers found that stories rich in these mechanisms
                    boosted popularity and engagement with audiences through a
                    range of media, from television to crowdfunding pitches.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The best-written stories were always either 'building up' a
                    current reversal, or introducing a new plot point," says
                    Prof. Knight. "In our analysis, the best writers were those
                    that were able to maintain both many plot points and strong
                    build-up for each plot point across the course of the
                    narrative."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers analyzed nearly 30,000 television shows,
                    movies, novels, and crowdfunding pitches using computational
                    linguistics, a blend of computer science and language
                    analysis. This allowed them to quantify not only the number
                    of a reversals in a text but also their degree or intensity
                    by assigning numerical values to words based on how positive
                    or negative they were.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Movies and television shows with more and bigger reversals
                    were better rated on the popular ratings site IMDb. Books
                    with the most and biggest reversals were downloaded more
                    than twice as much as books with the fewest reversals from
                    the free online library Project Gutenberg. And GoFundMe
                    pitches with more and larger reversals were more likely to
                    hit their fundraising goal, by as much as 39 per cent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Greek philosopher Aristotle was the first to identify
                    peripeteia, the sudden reversal of circumstances, as a key
                    feature of a good story. Other thinkers have added their
                    ideas since then, including American playwright and
                    dramaturg Leon Katz whose scholarship particularly inspired
                    Prof. Knight's research. Katz "described the reversal as the
                    basic unit of narrative, just as a sentence is the basic
                    unit of a paragraph, or the syllogism is the basic unit of a
                    logical proof," says Prof. Knight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to helping psychologists understand how
                    narrative works to educate, inform and inspire people, the
                    findings may also benefit storytellers of all kinds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Hopefully our research can help build a pedagogy for
                    writers that allows them to rely on the accumulated
                    knowledge of Aristotle et al. without having to 'reinvent
                    the wheel' on their own every time," says Prof. Knight.

                    [...] When Constellation signaled interest in restarting
                    Three Mile Island in July, doubts surfaced about the
                    technical feasibility of the project. Not only would it be
                    the first of its kind, but it will have to be accomplished
                    next to another reactor whose clean-up and decommissioning
                    is expected to continue through 2078.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The site also remains politically contentious due to the
                    lasting memory of the 1979 accident, which displaced
                    surrounding communities and left a legacy of fear over
                    whether the radiation released contributed to increased
                    cancer rates in the vicinity. About 2 million people were
                    exposed to radioactive fallout as a result of the meltdown.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Public health researchers from Temple, Penn State and the
                    University of Pittsburgh published a report last year
                    finding that long-term studies into the impact of the
                    meltdown were limited by research flaws.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite these concerns, Constellation cited a statewide poll
                    showing strong support for restarting Three Mile Island. The
                    poll conducted by Susquehanna Polling &amp; Research found
                    Pennsylvania residents approve of restarting Three Mile
                    Island by more than 2-1 and 70% favor the ongoing use of
                    nuclear energy in the state.

                    Thousands of lives could be saved around the world after NHS
                    scientists discovered a new blood group system - solving a
                    50-year-old mystery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research team, led by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT)
                    scientists in South Gloucestershire and supported by the
                    University of Bristol, found a blood group called MAL.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They identified the genetic background of the previously
                    known AnWj blood group antigen, which was discovered in 1972
                    but unknown until now after this world-first test was
                    developed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Senior research scientist at NHSBT Louise Tilley said the
                    discovery means better care to rare patients can be offered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ms Tilley, who has worked on the project for 20 years, told
                    the BBC it is "quite difficult to a put a number" on how
                    many people will benefit from the test. However, the NHSBT
                    is the last resort for about 400 patients across the world
                    each year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Everyone has proteins outside their red blood cells known as
                    antigens, but a small number might lack them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using genetic testing, NHSBT's International Blood Group
                    Reference Laboratory in Filton have for the first time
                    developed a test that will identify patients missing this
                    antigen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The test could prove a lifesaver for those who would react
                    against a blood transfusion, and will make it easier to find
                    potential blood developers for this rare blood type.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Philip Brown, who works at the laboratory, was diagnosed
                    with a form of leukaemia about 20 years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He had blood transfusions and a bone marrow transplant -
                    without that, he would have died.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Anything we can do to make our blood much safer and a
                    better match for patients is a definite step in the right
                    direction," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Head of the laboratory Nicole Thornton said: "Resolving the
                    genetic basis for AnWj has been one of our most challenging
                    projects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There is so much work that goes into proving that a gene
                    does actually encode a blood group antigen, but it is what
                    we are passionate about, making these discoveries for the
                    benefit of rare patients around the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Now genotyping tests can be designed to identify
                    genetically AnWj-negative patients and donors.

                  <p>
                    "Such tests can be added to the existing genotyping

                A music historian at the Austrian state archives, Paul Duncan,
                has completed the final component of an investigation into a
                lost Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791) piece. It was

                The result, due to an ongoing effort of just over 20 years, now
                allows for the all developers and users to utilize real-time
                computing without having to target a completely separate OS.
                Embedded systems and live processing will likely see more
                immediate improvements. This support is limited to X86, X86_64,
                ARM64, and RISCV and only capable of hard real time on hardware
                that supports it. However, the new competition and interest will
                likely spur on more developments in Real-Time Computing the
                future.

                One final note is that enabling PREEMPT_RT is not a panacea
                leading to better performance. Real time computing and real-time
                OSes sacrifice maximum throughput for guaranteed latency with
                minimal jitter. Real time does not mean "as fast as possible."
                Real time means "not too slow." In the wrong situation, it can
                actually make your performance worse.

                    The search for the energy of the future continues in all
                    parts of the world, from Antarctica to outer space (yes,
                    also outside our planet). However, it seems that this new
                    race has been won by America, where we have found what all
                    countries are looking for: this is the region that is going
                    to earn trillions of dollars for the energy of the future:
                    the enigmatic golden hydrogen.

                    The United States has recently, as you know discovered rich
                    hydrogen resources within the country that would alter the
                    current energy situation. The use of hydrogen is gradually
                    becoming an indispensable measure in the shift towards the
                    non-utilization of fossil resources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The DoE has noted massive under ground pool of hydrogen
                    energy in various places across the country. Hydrogen, the
                    first, lightest element on the periodic table of elements,
                    is the most abundant element in the universe and yet, the
                    discovery of hydrogen in concentrated form in this planet
                    has been a task.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    New assessments hence show the prospect that these domestic
                    supplies can be used to fuel automobiles, factories and even
                    electrification. Promising innovation and development in
                    infrastructure, hydrogen is capable of powering America's
                    tomorrow.

                  <p>
                    Scientists in United States have found that there exist very
                    huge resources of hydrogen gaseous fuel trapped beneath the
                    surface of the earth, that can sustain all consumers for
                    hundreds of years. The Department of Energy has claimed that
                    the resources of hydrogen in some parts of the country to be
                    in trillions of dollars.

                  <p>
                    This natural hydrogen was generated through geo-chemical
                    processes, it has been confined within underlying rocks and
                    sediments. Though hydrogen is present in immensely massive
                    quantities in the universe, localized, denser sources here
                    on Earth are relatively scarce.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If one uses the correct technology then one can know that
                    this enormous source of clean energy could fuel the society
                    for ages. A key advantage here is that the hydrogen does not
                    have to be produced, which means there is no environmental
                    and economic cost associated with its production.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Accessing these hydrogen resources is one of the prospects
                    for shifting the oil and gas industry to a new level of
                    energy production. However, it must be noted that there are
                    technical issues that can be associated with scaling of
                    hydrogen release and the efficient harvesting of hydrogen in
                    a safe and sustainable manner.

                  <p>
                    Signs of huge deposits of hydrogen have known to exist
                    underground in different sedimentary basins in the United
                    States of America. They contain the world's largest deposits
                    mainly in the western part of the USA in Texas, New Mexico,
                    Utah and Colorado.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These areas contain trillions of cubic feet of hydrogen gas
                    dislocated in rock structures at depths of the earth crust.
                    These hydrogen sources were generated from deposits of
                    natural gas that over millions of years interacted with
                    water and rock to create whatis referred to as hydrostatic
                    hydrogen or hydrostatic pressure.

                    The largest Onshore Basin in the View of Oil and Gas
                    Resources is the Gulf Coast Basin which Texas possesses some
                    of the greatest extents. San Juan Basin is endowed with the
                    major natural resources in New Mexico. Another region that
                    holds extensive amounts is the Uinta Basin of Utah.

                    A recent study finds that hope appears to be more beneficial
                    than mindfulness at helping people manage stress and stay
                    professionally engaged during periods of prolonged stress at
                    work. The study underscores the importance of looking ahead,
                    rather than living "in the moment," during hard times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mindfulness refers to the ability of an individual to focus
                    attention on the present, in a way that is open, curious and
                    not judgmental. Essentially, the ability to be fully in the
                    moment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There's a lot of discussion about the benefits of
                    mindfulness, but it poses two challenges when you're going
                    through periods of stress," says Tom Zagenczyk, co-author of
                    a paper on the work and a professor of management in North
                    Carolina State University's Poole College of Management.
                    "First, it's hard to be mindful when you're experiencing
                    stress. Second, if it's a truly difficult time, you don't
                    necessarily want to dwell too much on the experience you're
                    going through.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Fundamentally, our findings tell us that hope was
                    associated with people being happy, and mindfulness was
                    not," says Kristin Scott, study co-author and a professor of
                    management at Clemson University. "And when people are
                    hopeful – and happy – they experience less distress, are
                    more engaged with their work, and feel less tension related
                    to their professional lives."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Being mindful can be tremendously valuable – there are
                    certainly advantages to living in the moment," says Sharon
                    Sheridan, study co-author and an assistant professor of
                    management at Clemson. "But it's important to maintain a
                    hopeful outlook – particularly during periods of prolonged
                    stress. People should be hopeful while being mindful – hold
                    on to the idea that there's a light at the end of the
                    tunnel."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the study focused on musicians during an extreme set
                    of circumstances, the researchers think there is a takeaway
                    message that is relevant across industry sectors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Whenever we have high levels of job stress, it's important
                    to be hopeful and forward looking," says Emily Ferrise,
                    study co-author and a Ph.D. student at Clemson. "And to the
                    extent possible, there is real value for any organization to
                    incorporate hope and forward thinking into their corporate
                    culture – through job conditions, organizational
                    communications, etc."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Every work sector experiences periods of high stress," says
                    Zagenczyk. "And every company should be invested in having
                    happy employees who are engaged with their work."

                    The US and Japan are close to a deal to curb tech exports to
                    China's chip industry despite alarm in Tokyo about Beijing's
                    threat to retaliate against Japanese companies.

                    The White House wants to unveil new export controls before
                    November's presidential election, including a measure
                    forcing non-US companies to get licences to sell products to
                    China that would help its tech sector.

                    Biden administration officials have spent months in intense
                    talks with their counterparts in Japan — and the Netherlands
                    — to establish complementary

                    targeted by the US "foreign direct product rule".

                  <p>
                    People in Washington and Tokyo familiar with the talks said
                    the US and Japan were now close to a breakthrough, although
                    a Japanese official cautioned the situation remained "quite
                    fragile" because of fears of Chinese retaliation.

                  <p>
                    [...] The US export controls are designed to close loopholes
                    in existing rules and add restrictions that reflect the fast
                    progress of Huawei and other Chinese groups in chip
                    production over the past two years.

                    [...] China said it "firmly opposes the abuse of export
                    controls" and urged "relevant countries" to abide by
                    international economic and trade rules.

                    [...] Most differences in colour perception are
                    physiological, like colour blindness, which affects one in
                    10 men and one in 100 women. Others, however, may be
                    connected to aspects of culture or language.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity,
                    popularised in the movie Arrival<em>,</em> suggests that
                    language shapes the way we think, and even how we perceive
                    the world. In the 1930s, Benjamin Lee Whorf argued that the
                    world consisted of "a kaleidoscopic flux of impressions
                    organised ... largely by the linguistic systems of our
                    minds", pointing to, for instance, the Inuits' multiple
                    words for "snow" as an example of differences in cultural
                    perceptions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although this theory continues to be hotly debated
                    throughout linguistics, psychology and philosophy, language
                    does inform how we communicate ideas. There's no word for
                    "blue" in ancient Greek, for example, which is why Homer
                    described stormy seas as "wine-dark" in The Odyssey. By
                    contrast, Russian has distinct words for light blue and dark
                    blue. However,
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2001946117"
                      >recent research</a
                    >
                    suggests a greater vocabulary may only be beneficial for
                    remembering colours and not for perceiving them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before you fight online about whether a particular shade is
                    aqua or cyan, it's important to note that ismy.blue's
                    results have limitations. The slightest variation in viewing
                    conditions influences colour perception, which is why vision
                    researchers take such care when designing experiments.
                    Factors like the model of your phone or computer, its age,
                    display settings, ambient light sources, time of day and
                    even which colour is presented first in the test will all
                    play a role in your responses.

                    Night modes in particular increase the redness of a device's
                    screen, causing blues to appear greener. To see if this was
                    influencing test results, Mineault separated the data into
                    two groups: before or after 6pm. The effect was immediately
                    apparent, especially on devices with built-in night modes.

                  <p>
                    So what's the point of ismy.blue if it's so variable? In the
                    end, it's just entertainment. But if you'd like results with
                    a little more equivalence, Mineault suggests doing the
                    exercise with others on the same device, so that
                    "everybody's in the same lighting and the same place".

                  <p>
                    [...] One question remains, though: what colour is the
                    blanket?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We've taken the test a bunch of times," says Mineault. "As
                    soon as there's a little green in there, I call it green";
                    his wife sees blue.
                  </p>

                    that" Amazon can charge for the smart TVs.

                    Denis Villeneuve can't stop making movies based on books.
                    The Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 director has delivered two
                    high-budget and polished Dune blockbusters in a row, while a
                    third is on the way. He also has three other book
                    adaptations in the works for when he's finished with Paul
                    Atreides, and the director finally gave a promising update
                    on one of those projects that could be the perfect follow-up
                    to Dune.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a conversation with Vanity Fair, Villeneuve addressed the
                    three other book-based movies he has in development:
                    Cleopatra, based on the biography by Stacy Schiff, Nuclear
                    War: A Scenario, based on the nonfiction book by Annie
                    Jacobsen, and Rendezvous With Rama, based on the sci-fi
                    novel by Arthur C. Clarke. "I'm working on Rendezvous With
                    Rama and that screenplay is slowly moving forward," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rendezvous with Rama isn't nearly as well known as Clarke's
                    best-known novel, 2001: A Space Odyssey, but it's definitely
                    well-suited to Villeneuve's mystical, epic style. The first
                    book in a series, Rendezvous with Rama follows a group of
                    human explorers in the distant future as they explore a
                    mysterious alien spaceship that's hurtling towards the sun.

                    Publishers, dissatisfied with this system, found a
                    workaround to conduct the auctions outside of Google's
                    purview, a process that became known as "header bidding."
                    Internal Google documents introduced at trial described
                    header bidding as an "existential threat" to Google's market
                    share.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google's response relied on its control of all three
                    components of the process. If publishers conducted an
                    auction outside Google's purview but they still used
                    Google's publisher ad server, called DoubleClick For
                    Publishers, that software forced the winning bid back into
                    Google's Ad Exchange. If Google was willing to match the
                    price that publishers had received under the header-bidding
                    auction, Google would win the auction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Professor Ramamoorthi Ravi, an expert at Carnegie Mellon
                    University, said rules imposed by Google failed to maximize
                    value for publishers and "seem to have been designed to
                    advantage Google's own products."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Google, for its part, says it hasn't run auctions this
                    way since 2019, and that in the last five years Google's
                    share of the display ad market has begun to erode. It says
                    that tying its buy side, sell side and middleman products
                    together helps them run seamlessly and quickly, and
                    minimizes fraudulent ads or malware risks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google also says its innovations over the last 15 years
                    fueled the improvements in matching online ads to consumer
                    interests. Google says it was at the forefront of
                    introducing "real-time bidding," which allowed an advertiser
                    selling shoes, for instance, to be paired up with a consumer
                    whose online profile indicated an interest in purchasing
                    shoes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those innovations, according to Google, allowed publishers
                    to sell their available ad space at a premium because the
                    advertiser would know that the ad was going to the eyeballs
                    of someone interested in their product or service.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Justice Department says that even though Google no
                    longer runs its auctions in the ways described, it helped
                    Google maintain its monopoly in the ad tech market in the
                    years leading up to 2019, and that its existing monopoly
                    allows Google to keep up to 36 cents on the dollar of every
                    ad purchase it brokers when the transaction runs through all
                    of its various products.

                    doubt above do not include watermarks, metadata, or AI
                    detectors as ideal solutions. That's because trust does not
                    inherently derive from the authority of a software tool. And
                    while AI and deepfakes have dramatically accelerated the
                    issue, bringing us to this new "deep doubt" era, the
                    necessity of finding reliable sources of information about
                    events you didn't witness firsthand is as old as history

                    synthesized digital media artifacts will be completely
                    indistinguishable from human-created ones. That means there
                    may be no reliable automated way to determine if a
                    convincingly created media artifact was human or
                    machine-generated solely by looking at one piece of media in
                    isolation (remember the sermon on context above). This is
                    already true of text, which has resulted in many
                    human-authored works being falsely labeled
                    [thedailybeast.com] as AI-generated, creating ongoing pain

                    In 1338, among a scattering of obscure villages just to the
                    west of Lake Issyk-Kul, Kyrgyzstan, people began dropping
                    dead in droves. Among the many headstones found in the
                    cemeteries of Kara-Djigach and Burana, one can read epitaphs
                    such as "This is the grave of Kutluk. He died of the plague
                    with his wife." Recently, ancient DNA exhumed from these
                    sites has confirmed the presence of the plague bacterium
                    <em>Yersinia pestis</em>, cause of the condition that became
                    known as the Black Death. The strain detected in those
                    remote graveyards of Central Asia has been identified as the
                    most recent common ancestor of the plague that went on to
                    kill as much as 60% of the Eurasian population in the great
                    pandemic of the 14th-century.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In 2018, a team of researchers found ancient traces of
                    the plague bacterium in 4900-year old remains in Sweden. A
                    few years later, traces of the bacterium were found in a
                    5000-year old skull in Latvia. It was tentatively suggested
                    that these finds correlate with the Neolithic Decline, and
                    might explain the large die off within these farming
                    societies. However the cases were isolated, with some of the
                    infected buried with uninfected, suggesting there wasn't an
                    epidemic comparable to the Black Death outbreaks that would
                    come in later millenniums.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Whether the Neolithic Decline was mostly, or in part,
                    caused by the plague is still up for debate, but one thing
                    is clear: humanity has been battling
                    <em>Yersinia pestis</em> for a long, long time.

                    is perhaps the least consequential and impressive, but it's
                    the most talked about due to a recurring meme where people
                    ask LLMs to count the number of Rs in the word "strawberry."
                    Due to tokenization, where the LLM processes words in data
                    chunks called tokens, most LLMs are typically blind to

                    A key Senate Committee is about to vote on two bills that
                    would bring back some of the worst patents and empower
                    patent trolls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Patent Eligibility Restoration Act (PERA), S. 2140,
                    would throw out crucial rules that ban patents on many
                    abstract ideas. Courts will be ordered to approve patents on
                    things like ordering food on a mobile phone or doing basic
                    financial functions online. If PERA Passes, the floodgates
                    will open for these vague software patents that will be used
                    to sue small companies and individuals. This bill even
                    allows for a type of patent on human genes that the Supreme
                    Court rightly disallowed in 2013.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A second bill, the PREVAIL Act, S. 2220, would sharply limit
                    the public's right to challenge patents that never should
                    have been granted in the first place.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Patent trolls—companies that have no product or service of
                    their own, but simply make patent infringement demands on
                    others—are a big problem. They've cost our economy billions
                    of dollars. For a small company, a patent troll demand
                    letter can be ruinous.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We took a big step towards fighting off patent trolls in
                    2014, when a landmark Supreme Court ruling, the Alice Corp.
                    v. CLS Bank case, established that you can't get a patent by
                    adding "on a computer" to an abstract idea. In 2012,
                    Congress also expanded the ways that a patent can be
                    challenged at the patent office.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These two bills, PERA and PREVAIL, would roll back both of
                    those critical protections against patent trolls. We know
                    that the bill sponsors, Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Chris
                    Coons (D-DE) are pushing hard for these bills to move
                    forward. We need your help to tell Congress that it's the
                    wrong move.

                Larry Ellison (of Oracle) predicts a future of AI enabled
                mass-surveillance where everyone lives in a panopticon.
                Constantly watched and recorded by AI that reports all
                transgressions.

                    But this is only the start of our surveillance dystopia,
                    according to Larry Ellison, the billionaire cofounder of
                    Oracle. He said AI will usher in a new era of surveillance
                    that he gleefully said will ensure "citizens will be on
                    their best behavior."

                    Ellison's vision bears more than a passing resemblance to
                    the cautionary world portrayed in George Orwell's prescient
                    novel 1984. In Orwell's fiction, the totalitarian government
                    of Oceania uses ubiquitous "telescreens" to monitor citizens
                    constantly, creating a society where privacy no longer
                    exists and independent thought becomes nearly impossible.

                We have been getting stories for a while about how JWST
                observations don't line up with the current Big Bang timelines.
                I'm certain there will be "Big Bang Band Aid" theories at least
                until the current crop of Astrophysicists who built their entire
                career on the semi-biblical "In the Beginning..." theory of
                where it all started have, themselves, died off. Meanwhile,
                there is also never a shortage of contrarian theories out there,
                and one of them is starting to get some support from the JWST
                observations of the "deep past" - which, maybe, isn't so deep
                after all.
              </p>
              <p>
                Current theories for the redshift observed in more distant
                galaxies rely on the postulate: "photons travel at the speed of
                light and arrive unchanged at their destination, exactly when
                they left their source, from their perspective."
              </p>
              <p>
                There are other theories. One, in particular, explains the
                observed redshifts with the idea that photons "get tired" on
                their Billions of light year journeys and lose a little
                frequency / gain a little wavelength along the way. JWST
                observations that are seeing mature galaxies back at, and
                before, the previously presumed start of "it all" may align
                better with the less well developed tiring photon theory than
                they do with the Big Bang. Not only does the "tired light"
                theory directly explain red-shift, but the observations of
                wavelength shift with respect to galactic rotation seem to be
                lining up better with "tired light" than "Big Bang," too...
              </p>
              <blockquote>

                    Around the same time, Fritz Zwicky, a well-known astronomer,
                    came up with a different idea.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He proposed that the redshift we see in distant galaxies —
                    basically a shift in the light spectrum towards red — might
                    not be because those galaxies are speeding away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead, he thought that the light photons from these
                    galaxies could be losing energy, or "tiring out," as they
                    travel through space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This energy loss could make it look like the farther
                    galaxies are moving away from us faster than they actually
                    are.
                  </p>

                    post and a tree before careening down a slope and igniting a
                    post-crash inferno. Fortunately, no one was injured.
                    However, the NTSB's report sheds light on the difficulty of
                    extinguishing fires in electric vehicles. Tesla's infamous
                    "thermal runaway" effect—the tendency of lithium-ion
                    batteries to reignite hours after being "put out"—was a
                    constant concern, but the semi's battery system stayed under
                    control this time.

                    [...] The blaze and the hazardous materials response that
                    followed created chaos along I-80, a key artery linking
                    Northern California with Nevada. Traffic was rerouted, and
                    the full shutdown stretched late into the evening, causing
                    significant delays.

                See, kid, back in the stone age we didn't have supercomputers in
                our pockets acting as telephones, we only had telephones. They
                were a permanent part of a room. If you weren't home, nobody
                could call you. But if you were a physician, people need to call
                you. So they had "pagers", also called "beepers," that alerted
                you to call the office.

              <p>
                They're not supposed to blow up. This is James Bond stuff. Since
                the Israelis can listen in to every cell phone call in the area,
                Hezbollah needed a secure way to communicate, so used pagers.
                But who loaded them with explosives? How? Pagers weren't big,
                the explosive must be high tech.

                    commoditization of Large Language Models (LLMs). The
                    simplicity of transitioning from one LLM to another is
                    largely due to the use of a common language (English) for
                    queries. This uniformity allows for minimal cost when
                    switching, akin to navigating between different e-commerce
                    websites. While LLM providers might use various APIs, these
                    differences are not substantial enough to significantly
                    raise switching costs.

                  <p>
                    In contrast, transitioning between different database
                    systems involves considerable expense and complexity. It
                    requires migrating data, updating configurations, managing
                    traffic shifts, adapting to different query languages or
                    dialects, and addressing performance issues. Adding
                    long-term memory [<a
                      href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogcacm/the-commoditization-of-llms/#four"
                      >4</a
                    >] to LLMs could increase their value to businesses at the
                    cost of making it more expensive to switch providers.
                    However, for uses that require only the basic functions of
                    LLMs and do not need memory, the costs associated with
                    switching remain minimal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Open source models like Llama and Mistral allow
                    multiple infrastructure providers to enter the market,
                    enhancing competition and lowering the cost of AI services.
                    These models also benefit from community-driven
                    improvements, which in turn benefits the organizations that
                    originally developed them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, open source LLMs serve as a foundation for
                    future research, making experimentation more affordable and
                    reducing the potential for differentiation among competing
                    products. This mirrors the impact of Linux in the server
                    industry, where its rise enabled a variety of providers to
                    offer standardized server solutions at reduced costs,
                    thereby commoditizing server technology.

                    The HP-12c is probably the most iconic financial calculator.
                    Not being in finance myself, and in fact being terribly bad
                    at that kind of thing, I never quite got the purpose of
                    these special-purpose devices. My ignorance came to a halt
                    due to an unfortunate combination of my fixed-rate mortgage
                    period ending and Liz Truss happening, and I was driven to a
                    sudden keen interest in the 'time value of money' (TVM)
                    calculation.
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    Earlier this year I came across a fairly benign-looking
                    reddit post describing some difficulty changing the decimal
                    point to a decimal comma on a new Brazilian-bought HP-12c.
                    Most of the replies were along the lines of 'you're holding
                    it wrong', but something caught my attention. They weren't
                    the only one, and not only had someone else had the same
                    experience, I was pointed to numerous Amazon reviews
                    describing similar woes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To find out for myself, I VPN'd myself over to the Brazilian
                    Amazon and started reading (with the assistance of my phone
                    and google translate) reviews. What I saw was quite
                    consistent - people couldn't change the point to the comma,
                    and the calculator also failed on something called the
                    internal rate of return (IRR) calculation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was curious, were these a different version of the HP-12c?
                    Was it a fake? It is generally accepted that the HP-12c (and
                    to some degree the related HP-12c platinum) will return
                    exactly the same results no matter. Why would it otherwise?
                    It was at this point I needed help, and a very kind
                    Brazilian redditor did the work needed to run the
                    aforementioned TVM tests as a forensic tool. What they found
                    was a set of results entirely different to not just the
                    regular HP-12c, but to any other financial calculator we had
                    tested.

                    old are the ones where there's the most pressure to commit
                    pension fraud, and they also have the worst records. For
                    example, the best place to reach 105 in England is Tower
                    Hamlets. It has more 105-year-olds than all of the rich
                    places in England put together. It's closely followed by
                    downtown Manchester, Liverpool and Hull. Yet these places
                    have the lowest frequency of 90-year-olds and are rated by
                    the UK as the worst places to be an old person.

                    Less than 2% of the EU's heavy freight vehicles are now
                    electric and hydrogen-powered. To meet the bloc's carbon
                    emission reduction targets, the share should rise to 40% of
                    new sales by 2030, the study released before the IAA
                    Transportation 2024 truck show in Hanover showed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Currently production costs for electric trucks are 2.5-3
                    times higher than for diesel ones, the study said, and with
                    logistics firms unwilling to accept higher costs for
                    emissions-free freight, that goal is still distant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To overcome that, prices for new electric trucks should be
                    no more than 30% higher than for diesel models, McKinsey
                    said, which would require a technological leap in batteries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For successful implementation of the EU's CO2 strategy, a
                    25% cut in charging costs is also needed, the study showed,
                    with 900,000 private charging points to be installed in
                    Europe by 2035, which would require a $20 billion
                    investment.

                    to be behind the Charles Darwin School attack. In a post on
                    the criminals' dark-web blog, they say they stole 200 GB of
                    data, including user, business data, employee, student and
                    financial information.

                    more frequently despite having the latest security measures
                    in place," he said. "Our understanding of our situation is
                    that it is similar to what was experienced by the NHS,
                    Transport for London, National Rail, other schools and
                    public sector departments."

                    [...] "There is no honor amongst the ransomware gangs
                    attacking schools in Washington state and the UK," Semperis
                    principal technologist Sean Deuby told
                    <em>The Register</em>, adding that schools are more
                    vulnerable targets because of their smaller IT budgets and
                    fewer defensive resources. "Attacking just before the first
                    day of school for young kindergartners demonstrates their
                    amorality."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the Seattle-area district hasn't called the incident
                    ransomware, "reading between the lines on these attacks
                    leads me to believe that the schools were hit by
                    ransomware," Deuby opined.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Most schools today use Office 365 but still depend
                    upon their on-premises identity system, Active Directory,
                    for its users," Deuby said, adding that this makes
                    exploiting Microsoft AD vulnerabilities more enticing to
                    criminals. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While there's "no silver bullet" to solve schools' security
                    challenges, he suggests working with their IT providers to
                    identify critical services "such as AD that are single
                    points of failure." 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If critical services go down, school stops, and the school
                    buses don't roll," Deuby noted. "Have a plan for what to do.
                    This doesn't have to be perfect but think now about what to
                    do if email goes away or a teacher portal is locked."

                    For some context, Loongson is a Chinese fabless chip company

                    develop domestic CPUs. Its

                    launched in late 2023 is claimed to match AMD's Zen 3 and
                    Intel's Tiger Lake architectures from 2020. While the
                    company has mostly played in the CPU space until now, the
                    GPU offerings represent a new push.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their current model, the 9A1000, is a pretty tame GPU aimed
                    at budget systems and low-end AI tasks. But the 9A2000 is
                    allegedly taking things to the next level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Loongson's Chairman and General Manager Hu
                    Weiwu, the 9A2000 delivers performance up to 10 times higher
                    than its predecessor. He claimed it should be "comparable to
                    Nvidia RTX 2080,"
                    <a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/794/762.htm">according</a>
                    to ITHome.

                  <p>
                    [...] That said, Loongson has another card to play. At the
                    same briefing, Weiwu also provided a teaser for their
                    next-gen 3B6600 CPU, making some lofty performance claims
                    about its architecture. He touted "significant" changes
                    under the hood that should elevate its single-threaded
                    muscle to "world-leading" levels,
                    <a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/794/753.htm">according</a>
                    to another ITHome report.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Previous leaks suggest this processor will pack eight LA864
                    cores clocked at a stout 3GHz, along with integrated LG200
                    graphics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for the launch, Weiwu gave a tentative first half of 2025
                    target for initial production, with mass availability
                    hopefully following in the second half of next year.

                    But if this 3B6600 chip can truly hang with the heavyweights
                    of x86 and Arm in per-core performance, it would mark a
                    major step up for the company.

                    with the previously reported DNA structure of Neandertals
                    that lived around 105,000 years ago, versus Neandertals
                    dating to around 50,000 to 40,000 years ago. Yet analyses of
                    carbon and other diet-related chemical elements in Thorin’s
                    bones and teeth suggest that he lived during an ice age,
                    which did not develop in Europe until about 50,000 years
                    ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thorin also inherited from his parents an unusually high
                    percentage of DNA segments containing consecutive pairs of
                    identical gene variants.

                    population (<em>SN: 10/19/22</em>).

                  <p>
                    Taken together, the genetic evidence fits a scenario in
                    which Thorin belonged to a Neandertal lineage that split
                    from other European Neandertals around 105,000 years ago,
                    the researchers say. For roughly the next 50,000 years, they
                    suspect, Thorin’s lineage consisted of small networks of
                    closely related communities that exchanged mates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Reasons why those ancient groups avoided mating with other
                    Neandertals in the region, possibly related to language or
                    cultural differences, are unclear, Sikora says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “If Thorin is really 50,000 years old, this would be
                    an amazing finding showing a strong genetic structure in
                    late Neandertals,” says paleogeneticist Cosimo Posth of the
                    University of Tübingen in Germany. But, he says, further
                    excavation and research at Grotte Mandrin will need to
                    confirm when Thorin lived.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers found Thorin’s remains in a small, natural
                    depression on the rock shelter floor. Slimak’s and Sikora’s
                    group cannot yet say how the body got there or whether it
                    originated in older sediment. An older date for the partial
                    skeleton would indicate, less surprisingly, that Thorin
                    belonged to an isolated population that petered out quickly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Long-term isolation would have resulted in Thorin inheriting
                    a greater number of short DNA segments containing identical
                    gene pairs than reported in the new study, Lalueza-Fox says.
                    Isolating more of Thorin’s DNA or collecting genetic
                    remnants from other fossil members of his lineage will
                    clarify the evolutionary story of these close-knit
                    Neandertals, he says.

                    [...] As a daily tech news writer, I keep an eye on the
                    latest innovations in AI image generation. Late last month
                    while browsing Reddit, I noticed a post from an AI imagery
                    hobbyist who goes by the name "<a
                      href="https://x.com/fofrAI"
                      >fofr</a
                    >"—pronounced "Foffer," he told me, so let's call him that
                    for convenience. Foffer announced that he had
                    <a
                      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1f0hs79/you_can_train_handwriting_loras_with_flux/"
                      >replicated J.R.R. Tolkien's handwriting</a

                  <p>
                    [...] Foffer's breakthrough was realizing that Flux can be
                    customized using a special technique called "LoRA" (short
                    for "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685"
                      >low-rank adaptation</a
                    >") to imitate someone's handwriting in a very realistic
                    way. LoRA is a modular method of fine-tuning Flux to teach
                    it new concepts that weren't in its original training
                    dataset—the initial set of pictures and illustrations
                    <a href="https://blackforestlabs.ai/">its creator</a> used
                    to teach it how to synthesize images.

                  <p>
                    [...] "I don't want to encourage people to copy other's
                    handwriting, especially signatures," Foffer told me in an
                    interview the day he took the Tolkien model down. But said
                    he would help me attempt to apply his technique to a less
                    famous individual for an article, telling me how I could
                    inexpensively train

                    on a cloud AI hosting site called Replicate. "I think you
                    should try it. I think you'll be surprised how fun and easy
                    it is," he said.

                    That file triggers the execution of a base64 obfuscated

                    The obfuscated string is a malware downloader that contacts

                    require the task to be completed quickly: five minutes for
                    building the project, 15 minutes to implement the fix, and
                    10 minutes to send back the final result.

                    This is supposed to prove the developer's expertise in
                    working with Python projects and GitHub, but the goal is to
                    make the victim skip any security checks that may reveal the
                    malicious code.

                  <p>
                    Lucina Uddin, a professor of psychology at the University of
                    California, Los Angeles, is the named plaintiff in an
                    antitrust lawsuit against six publishers of academic
                    journals: Elsevier, Wolters Kluwer, Wiley, Sage, Taylor and
                    Francis Group, and Springer. The lawsuit accuses the
                    publishers of collusion in violation of Section 1 of the
                    Sherman Act, stating that they "conspired to unlawfully
                    appropriate billions of dollars that would have otherwise
                    funded scientific research."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The plaintiff "seeks to recover treble damages, an
                    injunction, and other relief."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in New York,
                    can be read in its entirety
                    <a

                      >here</a
                    >. The early paragraphs in which the publishers' "scheme" is
                    described are a good read:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        The Publisher Defendants' Scheme has three primary
                        components. First, the Publisher Defendants agreed to
                        not compensate scholars for their labor, in particular
                        not to pay for their peer review services (the "Unpaid
                        Peer Review Rule"). In other words, the Publisher
                        Defendants agreed to fix the price of peer review
                        services at zero. The Publisher Defendants also agreed
                        to coerce scholars into providing their labor for
                        nothing by expressly linking their unpaid labor with
                        their ability to get their manuscripts published in the
                        Publisher Defendants' journals. In the "publish or
                        perish" world of academia, the Publisher Defendants
                        essentially agreed to hold the careers of scholars
                        hostage so that the Publisher Defendants could force
                        them to provide their valuable labor for free.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Second, the Publisher Defendants agreed not to compete
                        with each other for manuscripts by requiring scholars to
                        submit their manuscripts to only one journal at a time
                        (the "Single Submission Rule"). The Single Submission
                        Rule substantially reduces competition among the
                        Publisher Defendants, substantially decreasing
                        incentives to review manuscripts promptly and publish
                        meritorious research quickly. The Single Submission Rule
                        also robs scholars of negotiating leverage they
                        otherwise would have had if more than one journal
                        offered to publish their manuscripts. Thus, the
                        Publisher Defendants know that if they offer to publish
                        a manuscript, the submitting scholar has no viable
                        alternative and the Publisher Defendant can then dictate
                        the terms of publication.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Third, the Publisher Defendants agreed to prohibit
                        scholars from freely sharing the scientific advancements
                        described in submitted manuscripts while those
                        manuscripts are under peer review, a process that often
                        takes over a year (the "Gag Rule"). From the moment
                        scholars submit manuscripts for publication, the
                        Publisher Defendants behave as though the scientific
                        advancements set forth in the manuscripts are their
                        property, to be shared only if the Publisher Defendants
                        grant permission. Moreover, when the Publisher
                        Defendants select manuscripts for publication, the
                        Publisher Defendants will often require scholars to sign
                        away all intellectual property rights, in exchange for
                        nothing. The manuscripts then become the actual property
                        of the Publisher Defendants, and the Publisher
                        Defendants charge the maximum the market will bear for
                        access to that scientific knowledge.

                    The IARC classification relied on previous observational
                    studies where people with brain cancer reported they used a
                    mobile phone more than they actually did. One example of

                  <p>
                    This new systematic review of human observational studies is
                    based on a much larger data set compared to what the IARC
                    examined in 2011.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It is the most comprehensive review on this topic – it
                    considered more than 5,000 studies, of which 63, published
                    between 1994 and 2022, were included in the final analysis.
                    The main reason studies were excluded was that they were not
                    actually relevant; this is very normal with search results
                    from systematic reviews.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No association between mobile phone use and brain cancer, or
                    any other head or neck cancer, was found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There was also no association with cancer if a person used a
                    mobile phone for ten or more years (prolonged use). How
                    often they used it – either based on the number of calls or
                    the time spent on the phone – also didn't make a difference.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Importantly, these findings align with

                    been no rise in the incidence of brain cancers.

                    The report calls on Member States to submit their final
                    National Energy and Climate Plans “as soon as possible” to
                    ensure the EU can meet its 2030 energy and climate goals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Earlier this year, the European Commission recommended that
                    the EU aims for a
                    <a

                    to be able to meet its target of net-zero emissions by 2050.

                    by five more gigantic satellites which are poised to become

                    orbit, according to AST SpaceMobile. The company's prototype

                    to the raw materials—namely weapons-grade uranium and
                    plutonium—that underpins them. The risk has been managed

                    Countries can do something similar for AI today. They can
                    regulate AI from the ground up by controlling access to the
                    highly specialized chips that are needed to train the
                    world's most advanced AI models.

                    While this doesn't include major food crops like rice and
                    wheat, pollination is essential to what the study's first
                    author – ecologist Katherine Turo from Rutgers University in
                    the US –

                    "If you look through a list of crops and think about which
                    fruits and vegetables you're most excited to eat – like
                    summer berries or apples and pumpkins in the fall – those
                    are the crops that typically need to be pollinated by
                    insects," Turo

                    And yet, there's a lack of experimental research on
                    pollinator limitation in crops. While we know the phenomenon
                    is impacting global food supplies, its prevalence has so far
                    been unclear.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Within this detailed picture, Turo and colleagues
                    found that up to 60 percent of global crop systems are being
                    limited by insufficient pollination. The phenomenon is
                    affecting 25 of the 49 different crop species analyzed, with
                    blueberry, coffee, and apple crops being the worst affected.

                  <p>
                    Pollinator limitation is occurring in 85 percent of the
                    countries in this database, spanning all six continents
                    represented.

                    "Our findings are a cause for concern and optimism," says
                    Turo.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We did detect widespread yield deficits. However, we also
                    estimate that, through continued investment in pollinator
                    management and research, it is likely that we can improve
                    the efficiency of our existing crop fields to meet the
                    nutritional needs of our global population."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Our findings show that by paying more attention to
                    pollinators, growers could make agricultural fields more
                    productive."

                    Curiosity is the driving force behind all science, which may
                    explain why so many scientists sometimes find themselves
                    going in some decidedly eccentric research directions. Did
                    you hear about the WWII plan to train pigeons as missile
                    guidance systems? How about experiments on the swimming
                    ability of a dead rainbow trout or that time biologists
                    tried to startle cows by popping paper bags by their heads?
                    These and other unusual research endeavors were honored
                    tonight in a virtual ceremony to announce the 2024
                    recipients of the annual Ig Nobel Prizes. Yes, it's that
                    time of year again, when the serious and the silly
                    converge—for science.
