                    recognize that change. Even when companies put Macs,
                    iPhones, and iPads in the hands of their employees, they are
                    failing to manage these deployments. It’s quite shocking.

                    place. That’s bad, as it means companies have no control
                    over how employees connect and use corporate resources,
                    creating a nice, soft attack surface for criminals and
                    competitors alike.

                    In that context, it makes total sense to think about how to
                    manage the devices connected to your systems and to put in
                    place the software, security, and user education it takes to
                    protect your business environments. The cost of device
                    management is relatively negligible compared to the
                    consequences of a

                    With this in mind, it’s surprising so many European — and,
                    by inference, global — businesses seem so poorly protected.

                    These findings were based upon oxygen isotopes (the same
                    element with different atomic masses), whereby the warmer
                    conditions cause the evaporation of lighter <sup>16</sup>O,
                    leaving the water enriched in heavier <sup>18</sup>O which
                    is then incorporated into the shells of organisms living in
                    the ocean, such as single-celled foraminifera.

                    [...] Through this work, the research team identified nine
                    glacial termination events, with the three marked by an
                    asterisk representing partial termination, while the
                    remainder are fully changing from glacial to interglacial
                    conditions. The precession cycles are noticeably different
                    between the glacial terminations, which Hobart and
                    colleagues suggest may be explained by the competing
                    influence of obliquity, as well as variable ice sheet size
                    at the beginning of each cycle. Therefore, they calculate
                    the duration between the cycles ranging from 90,400 and
                    115,500 years, with the more distinct changes in precession
                    a clear indicator of the sensitivity of Late Pleistocene ice
                    sheets.

                    continually track other objects in geosynchronous orbit, a
                    capability that military leaders have prioritized over the
                    last decade. In that time, Pentagon officials say there has
                    been an escalation in "cat and mouse" games between US
                    satellites and those operated by China and Russia.

                    The US military already has its own satellites capable of
                    approaching other objects in geosynchronous orbit. These
                    satellites,

                    So far, there haven't been reports that any of these
                    cat-and-mouse games have resulted in either a physical or
                    cyber attack on a US military satellite, but that's what the
                    Silent Barker mission is designed to guard against.

                    "There are several critical issues with current evaluation
                    techniques for large language models," says Natalie Shapira,
                    a computer scientist at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan,
                    Israel. "It creates the illusion that they have greater
                    capabilities than what truly exists."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's why a growing number of researchers—computer
                    scientists, cognitive scientists, neuroscientists,
                    linguists—want to overhaul the way they are assessed,
                    calling for more rigorous and exhaustive evaluation. Some
                    think that the practice of scoring machines on human tests
                    is wrongheaded, period, and should be ditched.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "People have been giving human intelligence tests—IQ tests
                    and so on—to machines since the very beginning of AI," says
                    Melanie Mitchell, an artificial-intelligence researcher at
                    the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. "The issue throughout
                    has been what it means when you test a machine like this. It
                    doesn't mean the same thing that it means for a human."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "There is a long history of developing methods to test
                    the human mind," says Laura Weidinger, a senior research
                    scientist at Google DeepMind. "With large language models
                    producing text that seems so human-like, it is tempting to
                    assume that human psychology tests will be useful for
                    evaluating them. But that's not true: human psychology tests
                    rely on many assumptions that may not hold for large
                    language models."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Webb is aware of the issues he waded into. "I share the
                    sense that these are difficult questions," he says. He notes
                    that despite scoring better than undergrads on certain
                    tests, GPT-3 produced absurd results on others. For example,
                    it failed a version of an analogical reasoning test about
                    physical objects that developmental psychologists sometimes
                    give to kids.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A lot of these tests—questions and answers—are online,
                    says Webb: "Many of them are almost certainly in GPT-3's and
                    GPT-4's training data, so I think we really can't conclude
                    much of anything."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The performance of large language models is brittle.
                    Among people, it is safe to assume that someone who scores
                    well on a test would also do well on a similar test. That's
                    not the case with large language models: a small tweak to a
                    test can drop an A grade to an F.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In general, AI evaluation has not been done in such a way
                    as to allow us to actually understand what capabilities
                    these models have," says Lucy Cheke, a psychologist at the
                    University of Cambridge, UK. "It's perfectly reasonable to
                    test how well a system does at a particular task, but it's
                    not useful to take that task and make claims about general
                    abilities."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The assumption that cognitive or academic tests
                    designed for humans serve as accurate measures of LLM
                    capability stems from a tendency to anthropomorphize models
                    and align their evaluation with human standards," says
                    Shapira. "This assumption is misguided."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The trouble is that nobody knows exactly how large
                    language models work. Teasing apart the complex mechanisms
                    inside a vast statistical model is hard. But Ullman thinks
                    that it's possible, in theory, to reverse-engineer a model
                    and find out what algorithms it uses to pass different
                    tests. "I could more easily see myself being convinced if
                    someone developed a technique for figuring out what these
                    things have actually learned," he says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I think that the fundamental problem is that we keep
                    focusing on test results rather than how you pass the
                    tests."

                    Shooter video game Call Of Duty has started using AI to
                    listen out for hate speech during online matches.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Publisher Activision said the moderation tool, which uses
                    machine learning technology, would be able to identify
                    discriminatory language and harassment in real time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Machine learning is what allows AI to learn and adapt on the
                    fly without explicit human instruction, instead using
                    algorithms and the data it's taught with to recognise
                    patterns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The tool being rolled out in Call Of Duty, called ToxMod, is
                    made by a company called Modulate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Activision's chief technology officer Michael Vance said it
                    would help make the game "a fun, fair and welcoming
                    experience for all players".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Activision said its existing tools, including the
                    ability for gamers to report others and the automatic
                    monitoring of text chat and offensive usernames, had already
                    seen one million accounts given communications restrictions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Call Of Duty's code of conduct bans bullying and harassment,
                    including insults based on race, sexual orientation, gender
                    identity, age, culture, faith, and country of origin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mr Vance said ToxMod allows the company's moderation efforts
                    to be scaled up significantly by categorising toxic
                    behaviour based on its severity, before a human decides
                    whether action should be taken.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Players will not be able to opt out of having the AI listen
                    in, unless they completely disable in-game voice chat.

                    this week. One of the reasons why the Biden administration
                    decided to require an export license on Nvidia's A100 and
                    H100 products and servers on their base is to thwart China's

                    government informed us of an additional licensing
                    requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined

                    already restricted for sale in China and Russia, which is
                    why Nvidia has developed H800 and A800 models with reduced
                    performance to sell in China. Although Nvidia disclosed
                    these new limitations in a U.S. regulatory filing, the
                    company did not reveal which countries in the Middle East
                    are specifically impacted by these controls.

                    Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been strengthening their
                    AI prowess in the recent years, which is why they
                    are significant purchasers of Nvidia's chips. Saudi Arabia
                    and the UAE have been in talks with China to deepen their
                    collaborations. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia even entered into
                    a strategic alliance with China, committing to work
                    collaboratively on artificial intelligence projects.

                    [...] If this letter is indeed about E-meters, the only
                    electronic device Scientology is readily connected to, then
                    Author Services may be concerned about how the Church of
                    Scientology's reputation could be impacted if E-Meters are
                    dissected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "My hunch is that the Scientologists think granting the
                    hacking community permission to dig into their E-Meter
                    software will expose the whole operation as snake oil. The
                    request is like so many other anti-Right to Repair
                    arguments: Manufacturers are afraid that access to repair
                    materials will expose some of their other dirty secrets,"
                    Chamberlain said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nathan Proctor, US Public Interest Research Group's senior
                    director, told 404 Media that Author Services' requested
                    DMCA changes would prevent people from repairing products
                    with end-user license agreements (EULAs). E-Meters have
                    EULAs, 404 Media reported, that block ordinary people from
                    getting into critical software and require an International
                    Association of Scientologists membership number to update
                    E-meter software.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Regardless of how an organization representing the works of
                    the creator of Scientology ended up in the Copyright
                    Office's mailbox, right-to-repair advocates say the
                    amendment would harm the movement and would extend past
                    electropsychometers if it were ever implemented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Obviously, very few people own E-Meters and even fewer
                    people want to repair them. But the amendment they're
                    proposing could undermine repair rights for many other
                    devices," Chamberlain said.

                    Kim Malfacini, head of product policy at OpenAI, says the
                    company is exploring how its text-generation technology is
                    being used for political ends. People are not yet used to
                    assuming that content they see may be AI-generated, she
                    says. "It's likely that the use of AI tools across any
                    number of industries will only grow, and society will update
                    to that," Malfacini says. "But at the moment I think folks
                    are still in the process of updating."

                    Scientists say the woman most likely caught the roundworm
                    after collecting a type of native grass, Warrigal greens,
                    beside a lake near where she lived. The area is also

                    contaminated by python faeces and parasite eggs - for

                    infectious diseases that have jumped from animals to humans.

                    While this might sound like science fiction, the federal
                    government has already embraced the technology. In May, the
                    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration offered

                    for laboratory services to assist with "autonomously
                    collected eDNA testing": environmental DNA testing based on
                    samples that are no longer even manually collected.

                    [...] "A universal database really just would subvert our
                    ideas of autonomy and freedom and the presumption of
                    innocence. It would be saying that it makes sense for the
                    government to track us at any time based on our private
                    information," Eidelman told The Intercept, adding that DNA
                    collection presents specific risks to privacy. "Our DNA is
                    personal and sensitive: It can expose our propensity for
                    serious health conditions, family members, and ancestry."

                    the department from collection requirements for non-U.S.
                    detainees. The task would have been too expensive, since
                    Congress had not allocated funding for DNA collection,
                    then-DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano explained.

                    that it would collect DNA samples from people arrested or

                    [...] For this study, they worked with three groups of
                    adults in their 20s with different drinking patterns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The groups were: light drinkers who do not binge-drink;
                    heavy social drinkers who binge-drink several times a month
                    (defined as consuming five or more drinks for a man or four
                    or more for a woman); and drinkers who meet the criteria for
                    alcohol use disorder and binge-drink 11 or more days in a
                    typical month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They had each group consume a set amount of alcohol and
                    tested their performance on both a fine motor task and a
                    paper-and-pencil cognitive skill test.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When given a standard intoxicating dose, which produce
                    breathalyzer readings of 0.08%, the light drinkers were more
                    impaired than the heavier drinkers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yet when those drinkers with alcohol use disorder consumed a
                    higher amount, akin to their usual drinking habits, they
                    showed significant impairment on those same tasks—more than
                    double their impairment at the standard intoxicating dose.
                    They did not return to baseline performance for at least
                    three hours after drinking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their level of impairment even exceeded that of the light
                    drinkers who consumed the standard dose, suggesting that the
                    physical effects of the alcohol add up the more someone
                    drinks, experienced or not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I was surprised at how much impairment that group had to
                    that larger dose, because while it's 50% more than the first
                    dose, we're seeing more than double the impairment," King
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "It's costly to our society for so many reasons,
                    that's why this study is just so important to understand
                    more," she said. "I'm hoping we can educate people who are
                    experienced high-intensity drinkers who think that they're
                    holding their liquor or that they're tolerant and won't
                    experience accidents or injury from drinking. Their
                    experience with alcohol only goes so far, and excessive
                    drinkers account for most of the burden of alcohol-related
                    accidents and injury in society. This is preventable with
                    education and treatment."

                reports on a find that could up-end much of what we believe on
                the origin of humans.

                    Africa has always been considered the cradle of mankind,
                    where humans evolved from apes on the continent before
                    spreading to the rest of the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An intriguing find is challenging the long-standing
                    assumption.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The partial skull of a new ancient ape has been discovered
                    in Turkey, and it appears to predate African apes,
                    suggesting that human origins may actually lie in Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fossil of Anadoluvius turkae was discovered in Cankiri,
                    a city about 138 kilometres north-east of Ankara, and is
                    thought to date from about 8.7 million years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In contrast, early hominins – the group that includes
                    chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, humans, and their fossil
                    ancestors – were not seen in Africa until about 7 million
                    years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It suggests that the ancestors of African apes and humans
                    evolved in Europe before migrating south between 9 million
                    and 7 million years ago.

                    Microsoft will start unbundling Teams from its Microsoft 365
                    and Office 365 productivity suites in EU markets in October.
                    The move is designed to avoid further antitrust scrutiny,

                  <p>
                    “Today we are announcing proactive changes that we hope will
                    start to address these concerns in a meaningful way, even
                    while the European Commission’s investigation continues and

                    changes will impact our Microsoft 365 and Office 365 suites
                    for business customers in the European Economic Area and
                    Switzerland.”

                  <p>
                    [...] Alongside the Teams unbundling, Microsoft is also
                    planning to improve its documentation on interoperability
                    with Microsoft 365 and Office 365 for rivals like Zoom and
                    Slack to integrate into Exchange, Outlook, and Teams.
                    Microsoft will also allow rivals to host Office web
                    applications within their competing apps, just like how
                    Microsoft does in Teams.

                  <p>
                    Microsoft will now have to wait on EU regulators to decide
                    whether its unbundling of Teams from Office suites in EU
                    markets is enough. “We believe these changes balance the
                    interests of our competitors with those of European business
                    customers, providing them with access to the best possible
                    solutions at competitive prices,” says Linde. “We also
                    recognize that we are still in the early stages of the
                    European Commission’s formal investigation. We will continue
                    to engage with the Commission, listen to concerns in the
                    marketplace, and remain open to exploring pragmatic
                    solutions that benefit both customers and developers in
                    Europe.”

                    Sulfur is a chemical element that’s found in soil, water,
                    and plants on Earth. Its existence on the Moon suggests that
                    it could be trapped in water ice in the lunar south pole;

                    on the Moon’s south pole also suggests that this region is
                    not as inhospitable as previously believed.

                    The south pole is of great interest to space agencies racing
                    to get to the lunar surface, with plans to build a permanent
                    lunar habitat and establish a sustainable human presence on
                    the Moon. Previous evidence suggests that the lunar south
                    pole has reservoirs of ice water in its permanently shadowed
                    regions, which could be used for drinking water or fuel.

                    [...] IBM spokesman Imtiaz Mufti denied that its work on the
                    contract was in conflict with its 2020 commitments. “IBM no
                    longer offers general-purpose facial recognition and,
                    consistent with our 2020 commitment, does not support the
                    use of facial recognition for mass surveillance, racial
                    profiling, or other human rights violations,” he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The Home Office Biometrics Matcher Platform and associated
                    Services contract is not used in mass surveillance. It
                    supports police and immigration services in identifying
                    suspects against a database of fingerprint and photo data.
                    It is not capable of video ingest, which would typically be
                    needed to support face-in-a-crowd biometric usage.”

                  <p>
                    Human rights campaigners, however, said IBM’s work on the
                    project is incompatible with its 2020 commitments. Kojo
                    Kyerewaa of Black Lives Matter UK said: “IBM has shown
                    itself willing to step over the body and memory of George
                    Floyd to chase a Home Office contract. This won’t be
                    forgotten.”

                    history of the universe? Webb makes this look easy. Now that
                    we've shown this is possible for the first time, we're
                    looking forward to trying to understand whether it's really
                    true that where there's smoke, there's fire. Maybe we'll
                    even be able to find galaxies that are so young that complex
                    molecules like these haven't had time to form in the vacuum
                    of space yet, so galaxies are all fire and no smoke. The
                    only way to know for sure is to look at more galaxies,
                    hopefully even further away than this one."

                    Currently, two of the biggest industry drivers of metaverse
                    development are Meta (formerly Facebook, which believed in
                    the technology so much it rebranded itself) and Microsoft,
                    both of which contributed to the study. Meta has been
                    focusing on individual experiences, such as gaming, while
                    Microsoft specializes in business solutions, including
                    remote conferencing and distance learning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These findings could help policymakers understand how
                    metaverse industry growth can accelerate progress towards
                    achieving net-zero emissions targets and spur more flexible
                    decarbonization strategies. Metaverse-based remote working,
                    distance learning and virtual tourism could be promoted to
                    improve air quality. In addition to alleviating air
                    pollutant emissions, the reduction of transportation and
                    commercial energy usage could help transform the way energy
                    is distributed, with more energy supply going towards the
                    residential sector.

                    On I Love Lucy, whenever Lucy or Ricky Ricardo gave out
                    their phone number, they'd say it as "Murray Hill 5-9975."
                    Even though that may look and sound like gibberish to modern
                    phone-users, it was perfectly normal at the time. Lucy, you
                    got some 'splaining to do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Phone numbers looked like this in the middle of the 20th
                    century because of telephone exchanges—the hubs through
                    which an area's calls would be routed. Phone subscribers
                    were given a unique five-digit number within their service
                    area. These would be preceded by two digits, which were
                    identified by letters, that denoted the telephone exchange
                    you were connected to. (Before the 1950s, some cities used
                    three letters and four numbers, while others had two letters
                    and three numbers. The two letter, five number format—or
                    "2L-5N"—was eventually standardized throughout the country).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because these telephone exchanges could only facilitate
                    around 10,000 subscribers, many large cities had multiple
                    hubs. The Ricardo's MUrray Hill5-9975 meant their number was
                    685-9975 ("Hill" and its capital H served purely as a
                    mnemonic), with the 68, or "MU," representing the east side
                    of Manhattan's telephone exchange. This is also why phones
                    still have letters over the numbers (three over 2 through 8,
                    and four over 9).

                    A high ratio of cesium-135 to cesium-137 is a telltale sign
                    that the isotopes came from nuclear weapons rather than
                    nuclear reactors. Radioactive cesium-135 is created when
                    xenon-135, a product of the nuclear fission of uranium,
                    decays without absorbing a neutron. In nuclear reactors, the
                    level of xenon-135 is controlled and converted to its stable
                    form of xenon-136 through neutron absorption. In the case of
                    nuclear weapons, however, xenon-135 is left to proliferate,
                    and it leads to higher levels of radioactive cesium-135.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers calculated that between 10 and 68
                    percent of the cesium contamination in the wild boar samples
                    are from nuclear weapons testing. "Although Chernobyl has
                    been widely believed to be the prime source of [cesium-137]
                    in wild boars, we find that 'old' [cesium-137] from weapons
                    fallout significantly contributes to the total level in

                    Now, the team is warning against the detrimental long
                    lasting effects of nuclear weapons and nuclear reactor
                    disasters on food safety. Countries like the US, Soviet
                    Union, and UK conducted thousands of nuclear weapons tests
                    during the Cold War from the 1940s to 1990s.

                    "An important takeaway is that the long-forgotten
                    atmospheric nuclear weapons tests and their fallout still
                    cast a shadow on the environment," Steinhauser told us.

                    "Just because they took place 60 years ago doesn't mean that
                    they no longer impact the ecosystem. Monitoring of wild
                    boars will remain necessary (then there is no problem eating
                    them). We must take good care of our planet and avoid any
                    further releases. These may create a snowball effect."

                    If you fancy creating a blog or website to discuss the Arm
                    architecture or the Softbank-owned outfit that develops it,
                    keep the British CPU designer's name out of the domain name
                    you choose – or draw the wrath of its lawyers.

                    [...] Strictly speaking, the letter went to the web host
                    provider for her Arm-related websites, who passed it onto
                    Markstedter to handle. The missive demanded that the website
                    come down as it featured Arm's "Arm" trademark in the domain
                    name.

                    [...] Arm's rush to snatch up domain names is somewhat
                    ironic, considering that in 2018 the biz create the website
                    riscv-basics.com and used it to host content smearing rival
                    RISC-V architecture and list multiple reasons why Arm's tech
                    is superior. Arm pulled the dot-com after an internal revolt
                    by its staff, and the domain has since lapsed into someone
                    else's hands.

                  <p>
                    Arm's takedown comes just a week after the Neoverse designer
                    officially filed for an IPO on the US Nasdaq. In the filing,
                    Arm disclosed numerous risk factors, including many related
                    to its operations in China. However, we don't recall any
                    mention of experts writing tutorials about its ISA as
                    something Arm thinks investors need to worry about.

                    Until now, the hard-shelled egg was thought to be the key to
                    the success of the amniotes - a group of vertebrates that
                    undergo embryonic or foetal development within an amnion, a
                    protective membrane inside the egg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, a fresh study of 51 fossil species and 29 living
                    species which could be categorised as oviparous (laying hard
                    or soft-shelled eggs) or viviparous (giving birth to live
                    young) suggests otherwise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings, published today in Nature Ecology &amp;
                    Evolution, show that all the great evolutionary branches of
                    Amniota, namely Mammalia, Lepidosauria (lizards and
                    relatives), and Archosauria (dinosaurs, crocodilians, birds)
                    reveal viviparity and extended embryo retention in their
                    ancestors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Extended embryo retention (EER) is when the young are
                    retained by the mother for a varying amount of time, likely
                    depending on when conditions are best for survival.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the hard-shelled egg has often been seen as one of the
                    greatest innovations in evolution, this research implies it
                    was EER that gave this particular group of animals the
                    ultimate protection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "EER is common and variable in lizards and snakes
                    today. Their young can be released, either inside an egg or
                    as little wrigglers, at different developmental stages, and
                    there appears to be ecological advantages of EER, perhaps
                    allowing the mothers to release their young when
                    temperatures are warm enough and food supplies are rich."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Professor Benton concluded: "Our work, and that of many
                    others in recent years, has consigned the classic 'reptile
                    egg' model of the textbooks to the wastebasket.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The first amniotes had evolved extended embryo retention
                    rather than a hard-shelled egg to protect the developing
                    embryo for a lesser or greater amount of time inside the
                    mother, so birth could be delayed until environments become
                    favourable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Whether the first amniote babies were born in parchment
                    eggs or as live, snapping little insect-eaters is unknown,
                    but this adaptive parental protection gave them the
                    advantage over spawning earlier tetrapods."

                    [...] One unproven theory is that day length might have
                    stalled at a constant value in Earth's distant past. In
                    addition to tides in the ocean related to the pull of the
                    Moon, Earth also has solar tides related to the atmosphere
                    heating up during daytime.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Solar atmospheric tides are not as strong as lunar oceanic
                    tides, but this would not always have been the case. When
                    Earth was rotating faster in the past, the tug of the Moon
                    would have been much weaker. Unlike the pull of the Moon,
                    the Sun's tide instead pushes Earth. So while the Moon slows
                    Earth's rotation down, the Sun speeds it up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Because of this, if in the past these two opposite forces
                    were to have become been equal to each other, such a tidal
                    resonance would have caused Earth's day length to stop
                    changing and to have remained constant for some time," said
                    Kirscher.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And that's exactly what the new data compilation showed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Earth's day length appears to have stopped its long-term
                    increase and flatlined at about 19 hours roughly between two
                    to one billion years ago—"the billion years," Mitchell
                    noted, "commonly referred to as the 'boring' billion."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The timing of the stalling intriguingly lies between the two
                    largest rises in oxygen. Timothy Lyons of the University
                    California, Riverside, who was not involved in the study,
                    said, "It's fascinating to think that the evolution of the
                    Earth's rotation could have affected the evolving
                    composition of the atmosphere."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new study thus supports the idea that Earth's rise to
                    modern oxygen levels had to wait for longer days for
                    photosynthetic bacteria to generate more oxygen each day.

                    Instead, the researchers behind the new study suggests a new
                    theory of how Earth was created.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There was a disk around the young Sun where the planets
                    were growing. The disk was filled with small dust particles.
                    Once a planet reaches a certain size, it sorts of act like a
                    vacuum cleaner, sucking up all that dust very quickly. And
                    that makes it grow to the size of Earth in just a few
                    million years," says Ph.D. student Isaac Onyett, who is the
                    corresponding author of the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This vacuuming of small dust particles not only played a
                    vital role in Earth's formation but made sure that water was
                    delivered to our planet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The disk also contains many icy particles. As the vacuum
                    cleaner effect draws in the dust, it also captures a portion
                    of the ice. This process contributes to the presence of
                    water during Earth's formation, rather than relying on a
                    chance event delivering water 100 million years later," says
                    Isaac Onyett.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With the new knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms
                    there is a much greater chance of water being present on
                    other planets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This theory would predict that whenever you form a planet
                    like Earth, you will have water on it. If you go to another
                    planetary system where there is a planet orbiting a star the
                    size of the Sun, then the planet should have water if it is
                    in the right distance," says Martin Bizzarro.

                    The International Gemini Observatory, a key player in global
                    astronomical research, has temporarily halted astronomical
                    operations following a cyberattack. The culprits and their
                    motives remain unknown.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The computer hack, which took place on the morning of August
                    1, led to the suspension of the Gemini North and South
                    Telescopes, as detailed in an August 24 statement from the
                    National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory
                    (NOIRLab). While the North telescope is situated in Hawaii,
                    its southern counterpart is located on Cerro Pachón, Chili,
                    with a few other smaller telescopes located in Cerro Tololo,
                    also in Chile. Observatories stationed on Arizona’s Kitt
                    Peak, however, remain unaffected by the intrusion, according
                    to NOIRLab.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “Like the entire astronomy community, we are
                    disappointed that some of our telescopes are not currently
                    observing. Fortunately, we have been able to keep some
                    telescopes online and collect data with in-person
                    workarounds,” NOIRLab stated in its release. “We are
                    grateful for the support of the astronomy community during
                    this difficult time and we thank everyone for their patience
                    as our teams continue to work towards restoring normal
                    operations.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For the time being, Gemini North has been securely
                    positioned in its zenith-pointing orientation. NOIRLab
                    credits the prompt actions of its security team for
                    preventing any damage to the observatory. As to who is
                    responsible for the hacks, or their motivations, that
                    remains either unknown or undisclosed. NOIRLab has been
                    tight-lipped about the incident, claiming that it is
                    “limited” in what it can share about its “cybersecurity
                    controls and investigatory findings.”

                    internal clock ran on exactly the same schedule. Some had

                    that of its host, and thereby help the immune system better
                    fight the invaders.

                    I recently bought an LG ULTRAGEAR monitor secondhand off of
                    a coworker. I really love it and it's been great so far, but
                    I ran into some minor issues with it in Linux. It works
                    great on both Mac and Windows, but on Linux it displays just
                    a black panel until I use the second monitor to go in and
                    reduce the refresh rate down to 60 Hz.
                  </p>
                  <p>This has worked decent so far but there's some issues:</p>

                    It doesn't work while linux is booting up. The motherboards
                    boot sequence is visible just fine, but as soon as control
                    is handed over to Linux and I'd normally see a splash screen
                    while I'm waiting for my login window, I see nothing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It doesn't work on the login screen. This would be fine if
                    login consistently worked on my second screen, but I need to
                    manually switch the cables between my work computer and the
                    desktop for the second screen and sometimes I don't feel
                    like doing that. Even when I switch the cables, the second
                    screen seems to be moody and doesn't always show the login
                    screen either.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once I've logged in and fixed the settings on my second
                    screen it seems to go fine, unless I actually unplug the
                    second screen. If I do, it looks like the graphics settings
                    go reset back to default (settings that don't work) and I
                    lose the main monitor too.

                        information about the cost of their broadband service.
                        We thus decline providers' request that they not

                    Scientists have been working on models of planet formation
                    since before we knew exoplanets existed. Originally guided
                    by the properties of the planets in our Solar System, these
                    models turned out to be remarkably good at also accounting
                    for exoplanets without an equivalent in our Solar System,
                    like super Earths and hot Neptunes. Add in the ability of
                    planets to move around thanks to gravitational interactions,
                    and the properties of exoplanets could usually be accounted
                    for.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today, a large international team of researchers is
                    announcing the discovery of something our models can't
                    explain. It's roughly Neptune's size but four times more
                    massive. Its density—well above that of iron—is compatible
                    with either the entire planet being almost entirely solid or
                    it having an ocean deep enough to drown entire planets.
                    While the people who discovered it offer a couple of
                    theories for its formation, neither is especially likely.

                From a pool of 32 university-level courses from eight
                disciplines, from political science to computer science, the
                average university student is being surpassed by ChatGPT.
                Exceptions in Maths, which is odd since it's basically a giant
                calculator, and with tick questions, that it apparently can't
                identify and detect properly.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is not made clear the level of the courses beyond that it
                mainly appears to be undergraduate courses, there should still
                be a difference between first and last year in level. Perhaps
                there is a difference from first year courses where it's mostly
                a matter of reciting known facts and data to the later half when
                the requirements of more critical thinking and interpretation
                and analysis is required.

                Other findings include that AI plagiarism detecting is poor and
                mostly unable to tell which text was written by a human and
                which is regurgitated AI text blobs.

                Alternatively it could also be that the average student have
                just gotten worse over the years. The bottom end of the spectrum
                has increased as more and more students are forced into
                academia.

                My understanding is that ATCS was unencrypted and could be
                easily monitored in the locations where it was installed. Not
                all locations had ATCS installed, meaning that some subdivisions
                might have ATCS while others did not. More recently, companies
                like BNSF have been

                  >lower frequencies around 200 MHz and are encrypted</a
                >. Although the encryption provides a greater level of security,
                and presumably systems still are engineered to default to
                stopping trains if the signaling systems aren't functioning,
                these changes also make it much more difficult to track the
                movement of trains for anyone who doesn't have the encryption
                keys.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps I'm misunderstanding some aspect of the system, but is
                there anything that would prevent a radio-based signaling system
                from using public key encryption? For example, a company like
                BNSF would have a private key for signals from their dispatchers
                and trains. Any trains operating on one of BNSF's subdivisions,
                whether BNSF, UP, Amtrak, or any other trains could then use
                BNSF's public key to decrypt the signals, verify that they were
                actually sent by the dispatcher, and then act accordingly on the
                signal. Any trains operating on the subdivision could use their
                owner's private key to send their location, speed, and any other
                information. For example, an Amtrak train operating on a BNSF
                subdivision would use the Amtrak private key to encrypt their
                data, but anyone with Amtrak's public key, including the BNSF
                dispatcher, could verify that the data was actually sent by the
                Amtrak train. This seems like it would make interoperability
                easier because it wouldn't require sharing the private key with
                other train operators using BNSF's subdivisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Public keys could be freely shared with everyone, meaning that
                the public could also monitor train locations and signals but
                would not easily be able to spoof the signals. It would be
                necessary to ensure that the signaling system wouldn't be
                vulnerable to recording and repeating an earlier encrypted
                command, but it's not clear that a public key system would be
                inherently more vulnerable to a repetition attack. I am curious
                if anyone knows why a system like this isn't implemented on US
                railroads, which should prevent attacks like what happened in
                Poland, but without locking out the public from monitoring train
                signals.

                    [...] Increased screen time can also affect the child’s
                    ability to be bored, Hutton told CNN, adding that boredom
                    breeds creativity and allows the child to pacify themselves,
                    rather than becoming reliant on a screen.

                    “Longer term, one of the real goals is for kids just to be
                    able to sit quietly in their own thoughts,” Hutton told the
                    outlet. “When they’re allowed to be a little bit bored for a
                    second, they get a little uncomfortable, but then they’re
                    like, ‘OK, I want to make myself more comfortable.’ And
                    that’s how creativity happens.”

                    said more screen time can also reduce a child’s ability to
                    build empathy, saying: “For a brain to develop and grow, it
                    needs essential stimuli from the outside world. More
                    importantly, they need time to process those stimuli.” It
                    added: “Exposure to screens reduces babies’ ability to read
                    human emotion and control their frustration. … It also
                    detracts from activities that help boost their brain power,
                    like playing and interacting with other children.”

                Scientists have solved the mystery of why tens of thousands of
                octopuses cluster on the foothills of a giant underwater
                mountain, two miles down off the coast of California. The pearl
                octopuses, so named because from a distance they look like
                scattered gems, seek out warm water seeping through the seabed
                and use it to speed up the hatching of their eggs<br />...<br />The
                mauve, grapefruit-sized female octopuses each lay about 60 eggs
                and cement them to the bare rock, then guard them until they
                hatch. Temperature probes showed the water bathing the eggs
                ranged from 5C to 10C (40-50F), while less than a metre away it
                dropped to a frigid 1.6C.
              </p>
              <p>
                Revisiting individual nests, the team saw that rather than
                taking a decade or longer to hatch, as would happen in the very
                cold deep sea, baby octopuses emerge from their cosy nests after
                less than two years, dramatically boosting their chances of
                survival.

                Secure your domain name for the next 100 years with Wordpress, a
                company that has only been around for about 20 years.<br />For
                only $38k including hosting fees and domain name. It's not
                exactly cheap, but I guess they had to include the cost of
                inflation and other increases for the next 100 years.

                Still unsure what is the weirdest part of it -- that they in
                general believe the system with domain names will be around in a
                century or that Wordpress will still be around. Also do you have
                to pay the century fee in advance or is it an installment plan
                per year or decade or? Not sure I would care to plonk down $38k
                at once for a domain name.

                Is this the future of the web? A necropolis of dead sites that
                never update. Who is there to secure that you actually remain
                online after death? Beyond trust and that you are hoping that
                Wordpress remains online.

                    [...] In recent months, Microsoft has come under blistering
                    criticism for security practices that led to the breach of
                    dozens of accounts belonging to customers using the
                    company's Azure and Exchange cloud offerings. What's
                    arguably worse has been the company's opaque notifications
                    of those events and the role Microsoft played in their
                    origins. The CEO and chairman of security firm Tenable, Amit
                    Yoran, recently said the company's security was mired in
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/microsoft-cloud-security-blasted-for-its-culture-of-toxic-obfuscation/"
                      >"grossly irresponsible" practices</a
                    >
                    and a "culture of toxic obfuscation."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those same dynamics are at play in Microsoft's recent
                    failures in policing the processes it put in place for
                    digitally certifying trustworthy Windows drivers. The
                    near-verbatim advisories mentioned earlier—one from

                    >
                    and the other from
                    <a
                      href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/ADV230001"
                      >last month</a
                    >—illustrate that whatever the company has been doing to
                    lock down the program isn't working. They also show how the
                    company relies on vague and ambiguous notifications that aim
                    to conceal as much as inform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft's driver-signing requirement is founded on a
                    concept known as security in depth. The idea is to have
                    multiple layers of security so that if one fails, another
                    will prevent a breach or at least contain the damage. In
                    this case, certificates are a hedge designed to lessen the
                    harm that comes when an adversary gains administrative
                    system rights to a compromised device.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Virtually all of the key-hijacking incidents reported in
                    recent years have been attributed to Chinese hackers,
                    usually for espionage purposes. Microsoft's string of
                    failures in locking down its certification program, and its
                    reticence when disclosing them, are undermining the entire
                    concept of security, much to the delight of these
                    adversaries.

                    by <em>Bloomberg</em>, the Starship launch left behind
                    devastating destruction to the local environment, as
                    reported by U.S. Wildlife officials following an
                    investigation of the site shortly after the launch. These
                    reports by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists were
                    obtained by the news outlet via a Freedom of Information Act
                    request.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wildlife officials note that upon surveying the scene after
                    Starship's launch, they found chunks of concrete across the
                    area and foot-deep craters on the tidal flats. The report
                    states that four acres of the nearby Texas state park were
                    burned. A group of blue land crabs and seven bobwhite quail
                    eggs were "incinerated" by the launch. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, the explosion from the launch "left a 385-acre
                    debris field that flung concrete chunks as far as 2,680 feet
                    from the launchpad and sparked a 3.5-acre fire."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Much of the damage was caused by a purposeful decision
                    from SpaceX that seemingly baffled experts in the documents.
                    SpaceX did not use flame-suppression technology like a flame
                    diverter or flame trench, a standard in the industry that
                    redirects energy away from the rocket ship. Without it,
                    Starship blew a hole in the ground underneath it,
                    subsequently destroying its launchpad.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The FAA is currently reviewing an investigation into the
                    launch and has temporarily grounded further attempts. But
                    one Wildlife official noted in the documents that it's
                    likely SpaceX won't be ready for another launch anytime
                    soon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Pad site was totally destroyed and will likely force them
                    to re-design the whole thing," the official wrote. "Probably
                    won't see another launch for a while."

                    Workplace burnout is widespread and has a detrimental effect
                    on employee performance, wellbeing, and the overall
                    productivity of the organisation. The literature contains
                    numerous studies exploring the causes and mechanisms of
                    workplace burnout; however, the role of personal
                    relationships in this context has not received sufficient
                    attention.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Burnout causes significant mental fatigue and manifests
                    through emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation (a state in
                    which individuals feel disconnected from their body,
                    thoughts, or emotions), and a decline in personal
                    fulfilment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The study findings indicate that as the level of
                    marital satisfaction increases, the risk of burnout
                    decreases, and this correlation is more pronounced in men.
                    The researchers attribute these findings to disparities in
                    social roles and stereotypes attributed to men and women,
                    along with variations in expectations related to marriage
                    and career.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When it comes to women, depersonalisation characterised by a
                    sense of detachment from colleagues and clients and a
                    decrease in empathy and compassion has a greater impact on
                    the development of burnout. For men, the most significant
                    factor is emotional fatigue from being overwhelmed with
                    requests and feeling incapable of effectively managing them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers suggest that depersonalisation experienced
                    by women is linked to the societal expectations and social
                    roles commonly imposed on them within the professional
                    realm. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings reveal that men who experience greater
                    professional success also tend to have higher levels of
                    satisfaction with their personal relationships. No such
                    correlation has been found for women. According to the
                    researchers, this suggests that support in one's personal
                    life may play a more significant role in facilitating
                    workplace success for men compared to women.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers emphasise that for organisations,
                    understanding the specific aspects of employee burnout can
                    serve as a valuable tool in managing stressful situations
                    and enhancing motivation.

                    In a groundbreaking endeavor, researchers at the University
                    of Rochester have successfully transferred a longevity gene
                    from naked mole rats to mice, resulting in improved health
                    and an extension of the mouse's lifespan.

                    Naked mole rats, known for their long lifespans and
                    exceptional resistance to age-related diseases, have long
                    captured the attention of the scientific community. By
                    introducing a specific gene responsible for enhanced
                    cellular repair and protection into mice, the Rochester
                    researchers have opened exciting possibilities for unlocking
                    the secrets of aging and extending human lifespan.

                    longevity mechanisms that evolved in long-lived mammalian

                    Night-time pollinators such as moths may visit just as many
                    plants as bees, and should also be the focus of conservation
                    and protection efforts, a new study from the University of
                    Sheffield suggests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study found that moths under pressure from urbanisation
                    may also be less resilient than bees, due to their more
                    complex life cycle and more specific plant requirements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It also revealed that despite this threat, moths play a
                    crucial role in supporting urban plant communities,
                    accounting for a third of all pollination in flowering
                    plants, crops and trees.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "As moths and bees both rely on plants for survival,
                    plant populations also rely on insects for pollination.
                    Protecting urban green spaces and ensuring they are
                    developed in such a way that moves beyond bee-only
                    conservation but also supports a diverse array of wildlife,
                    will ensure both bee and moth populations remain resilient
                    and our towns and cities remain healthier, greener places."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] [Study author Dr. E.E.] Ellis says the research
                    demonstrates just how crucial moths are at pollinating
                    plants, including crops, and that the study has implications
                    for wildlife-friendly gardening initiatives, urban planners
                    and policy makers responsible for developing urban green
                    spaces for parks or urban horticulture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She said: "People don't generally appreciate moths so they
                    can often be overlooked compared to bees when talking about
                    protection and conservation, but it's becoming apparent that
                    there needs to be a much more focused effort to raise
                    awareness of the important role moths play in establishing
                    healthy environments, especially as we know moth populations
                    have drastically declined over the past 50 years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When planning green spaces, consideration needs to be given
                    to ensure planting is diverse and moth-friendly as well as
                    bee-friendly, to ensure both our plants and insects remain
                    resilient in the face of the climate crisis and further
                    losses."

                    prominent nationalist commentator Hu Xijin wrote on Weibo.

                    Consul General in Belfast Zhang Meifang posting an animation
                    on social media platform X—which is banned in China—of

                    against radiation—as well as fears that sea salt from the
                    Pacific might be contaminated—has prompted panic buying of

                    The VESPA payload adapter has been floating in Earth's orbit
                    following the launch of a Vega rocket in 2013, adding to the
                    thousands of pieces of space junk that currently surround
                    our planet. On August 10, the European Space Agency (ESA)
                    was informed by the United States 18th Space Defense
                    Squadron that new pieces of debris were spotted within the
                    vicinity of the VESPA adapter, suggesting that the object
                    broke up into smaller pieces due to a collision with another
                    piece of space debris.

                  <p>
                    After a decade in orbit as a useless piece of space junk,
                    VESPA was on the verge of serving a final purpose as the
                    target of ClearSpace-1—a claw-like spacecraft designed to
                    grab space junk and fling it into Earth's atmosphere to burn
                    up. The European mission is slated for launch in 2026, and
                    was meant to rendezvous with VESPA in order to test the new
                    junk removal technology in space.

                    But even if BA.2.86 does what Bloom sees as mostly
                    likely—fade away to an esoteric evolutionary anomaly—it
                    should still raise alarm over the current state of our virus
                    monitoring, as experts at the World Health Organization have
                    repeatedly warned about.

                  <p>
                    Part of the reason there is so little data on BA.2.86 is
                    that there is relatively little data on circulating variants
                    in general. In early 2022, at the height of pandemic genomic
                    surveillance, scientists worldwide submitted nearly 100,000
                    coronavirus genetic sequences per week to the public genomic
                    database (GISAID). In the past month, however,

                    In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                    has likewise seen a perilous drop in monitoring. In early
                    2022, the agency collected data from nearly 100,000 COVID-19
                    tests per week. Now, amid a summer wave with test positivity
                    on the rise again, the

                      href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklyhospitaladmissions_testpositivity_00"
                      >test volume is just 40,000</a
                    >. And the agency only has enough genomic surveillance data
                    to

                    [...] But things have only gotten worse since then. In
                    October 2022, for instance, scientists submitted over 20,000
                    coronavirus sequences per week to GISAID, compared with the
                    current average of around 5,000.

                    Paralysis had robbed the two women of their ability to
                    speak. For one, the cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
                    or ALS, a disease that affects the motor neurons. The other
                    had suffered a stroke in her brain stem. Though they can't
                    enunciate clearly, they remember how to formulate words.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, after volunteering to receive brain implants, both are
                    able to communicate through a computer at a speed
                    approaching the tempo of normal conversation. By parsing the
                    neural activity associated with the facial movements
                    involved in talking, the devices decode their intended
                    speech at a rate of 62 and 78 words per minute,
                    respectively—several times faster than the previous record.
                    Their cases are detailed in two papers published Wednesday
                    by separate teams in the journal Nature.

                    "It is now possible to imagine a future where we can restore
                    fluid conversation to someone with paralysis, enabling them
                    to freely say whatever they want to say with an accuracy
                    high enough to be understood reliably," said Frank Willett,

                    While slower than the roughly 160-word-per-minute rate of
                    natural conversation among English speakers, scientists say
                    it's an exciting step toward restoring real-time speech
                    using a brain-computer interface, or BCI.

                    who defected a few years ago. "The value systems of North
                    Korea are quite different."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With the image of the Supreme Leaders looming large and the
                    propaganda machine pushing slogans like "we do whatever the
                    Party decides!" or "self-reliant prosperity," writing about
                    the future can be challenging. In some cases, imagining how
                    great North Korea could be might draw attention to its
                    current flaws.

                    "Science fiction is about anticipation, and this is a big
                    problem," said Antoine Coppola, a filmmaker who has studied
                    cinema in both North and South Korea. "Society is perfect in
                    North Korea; the hierarchy is perfect, so why dream about
                    the future? How to imagine the future when society is
                    perfect?"
                  </p>

                    The contrast between the stories sci-fi literature tells and
                    the daily lives of the people has only become sharper.
                    "Since at least the 1990s, there has been not simply a gap
                    but an abyss between the rosy future depicted in North
                    Korean science fiction and the reality of life in North
                    Korea," Harvard historian of science Dong-Won Kim wrote in
                    one of his papers in 2018.<br />[...]<br />As North Korean
                    writers become more exposed to the West, the stories they
                    write are slowly changing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Recent sci-fi has that sort of sensationalism, the
                    suspense, the conspiracy motif, probably tied to the
                    increased availability of foreign media in the country,"
                    Berthelier said. "To me, it's revolutionary because there
                    isn't quite anything like that in the country's literary
                    history."

                    Resting-state functional MRI scans showed that slower
                    solvers had higher average functional connectivity, or
                    temporal synchrony, between their brain regions. In
                    personalized brain simulations of the 650 participants, the
                    researchers could determine that brains with reduced
                    functional connectivity literally "jump to conclusions" when
                    making decisions, rather than waiting until upstream brain
                    regions could complete the processing steps needed to solve
                    the problem.

                    [...] "Synchronization, <em>i.e</em>., the formation of
                    functional networks in the brain, alters the properties of
                    working memory and thus the ability to 'endure' prolonged
                    periods without a decision," explains Michael Schirner, lead
                    author of the study and a scientist in Ritter's lab. "In
                    more challenging tasks, you have to store previous progress
                    in working memory while you explore other solution paths and
                    then integrate these into each other. This gathering of
                    evidence for a particular solution may sometimes takes
                    longer, but it also leads to better results. We were able to
                    use the model to show how excitation-inhibition balance at
                    the global level of the whole brain network affects
                    decision-making and working memory at the more granular
                    level of individual neural groups."
