                    Being announced today by AMD for a November 21st launch,
                    this morning AMD is taking the wraps off of their Ryzen 7000
                    Threadripper CPUs. These high-end chips are being split up
                    into two product lines, with AMD assembling the
                    workstation-focused Ryzen Threadripper 7000 Pro series, as
                    well as the non-pro Ryzen Threadripper 7000 series for the
                    more consumer-ish high-end desktop (HEDT) market. Both chip
                    lines are based on AMD's tried and true Zen 4 architecture –
                    derivatives of AMD's EPYC server processors – incorporating
                    AMD's Zen 4 chiplets and a discrete I/O dies. As with
                    previous generations of Threadripper parts, we're
                    essentially looking at the desktop version of AMD's EPYC
                    hardware.

                    Then why is this method of dispersal not seen in other
                    insects? The Kobe University researcher explains, "The eggs
                    of most insect species are typically fertilized just before
                    being laid, relying on sperm stored within the female
                    insects after copulation. However, in some stick insect
                    species, females are parthenogenic, that is, they can
                    produce viable eggs without fertilization." It is only
                    because of this quirk in their nature that viable stick
                    insect babies can hatch from the eggs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is important to keep in mind that stick insects are
                    called that way precisely because their main strategy of
                    survival is not being eaten by their predators, as opposed
                    to many plants that rely on their fruit being ingested and
                    thus their seeds being dispersed by animals. Nevertheless,
                    Suetsugu explains the importance of this result for the
                    scientific community: "This finding invites researchers to
                    delve deeper into the mechanisms of dispersal in various
                    species and challenge long-held assumptions about the fate
                    of organisms devoured by predators."

                    Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) consume only about 10% of the
                    electricity required by traditional incandescent lights and
                    last up to 25 times longer, so it's no surprise that they
                    have become commonplace over the past two decades.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But there is a downside to LEDs: They're much brighter than
                    old-fashioned energy-guzzling light bulbs. When an entire
                    city gets fitted with energy-saving LED lamps, this bright
                    light scatters through

                    at an average rate of 10% per year. This trend affects even
                    the world's most remote observatories. Germany-based startup

                    StealthTransit's solution relies on three components: A
                    simple device that makes LED lights flicker at a very high
                    frequency that is imperceptible to the human eye, a GPS
                    receiver, and a specially designed shutter on the
                    telescope's camera that can blink in sync with the LED
                    lights. The GPS technology guides the telescope's shutter to
                    open only during the fleeting moments when the LED lights
                    are switched off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The experiments, conducted at an observatory in the Caucasus
                    Mountains in Russia, showed that the technology, dubbed the
                    DarkSkyProtector, could reduce unwanted sky glow in
                    astronomical images by 94%.
                  </p>

                    [...] It might sound impractical to refit an entire town
                    with devices that allow lamps to blink, but Pashkovsky said
                    that most existing LED lights can operate in the blinking
                    mode and that new lamps designed specifically with sky
                    protection in mind would be no costlier than existing LED
                    technology. The most expensive element of the
                    DarkSkyProtector system is the telescope shutter, which
                    needs to be lightweight and agile enough to blink about 150
                    times per second.

                    Cisco is urging customers to protect their devices following
                    the discovery of a critical, actively exploited zero-day
                    vulnerability that's giving threat actors full
                    administrative control of networks.

                    "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an
                    attacker to create an account on the affected device with
                    privilege level 15 access, effectively granting them full
                    control of the compromised device and allowing possible
                    subsequent unauthorized activity," members of Cisco's Talos

                    recommend affected entities immediately implement the steps
                    outlined in Cisco's PSIRT advisory."<br />[...]<br />Monday's
                    advisory went on to say that after gaining access to a
                    vulnerable device, the threat actor exploits a medium
                    vulnerability, CVE-2021-1435, which Cisco patched two years
                    ago. The Talos team members said that they have seen devices
                    fully patched against the earlier vulnerability getting the
                    implant installed "through an as of yet undetermined
                    mechanism."<br />[...]<br />It should go without saying, but
                    the HTTP and HTTPS server feature should never be enabled on
                    Internet-facing systems as is consistent with
                    long-established best practices. Cisco reiterated the
                    guidance in Monday's advisory.

                    One of the most striking areas on Mars is its Noctis
                    Labyrinthus—Latin for the "Labyrinth of Night." It lies
                    between Mars's Valles Marineris and the gigantic volcanoes
                    of the Tharsis Bulge.

                    This shattered terrain is a system of valleys that stretch
                    out across nearly 1,200 kilometers. Scientists combined
                    ESA's Mars Express images into an amazing flyover of this

                    [...] It's cool to think of Mars Express focusing a
                    high-resolution movie camera on the surface. However, this

                    topographic information from a digital terrain model. That
                    helped the visualization team generate a three-dimensional
                    landscape, with every second of the video comprising 50
                    separate frames rendered according to a pre-defined camera

                    You might think of the Intel 386 processor (1985) as just an
                    early processor in the x86 line, but the 386 was a critical
                    turning point for modern computing in several ways.1 First,
                    the 386 moved the x86 architecture to 32 bits, defining the
                    dominant computing architecture for the rest of the 20th
                    century. The 386 also established the overwhelming
                    importance of x86, not just for Intel, but for the entire
                    computer industry. Finally, the 386 ended IBM's control over
                    the PC market, turning Compaq into the architectural leader.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The 80386 was a major advancement over the 286: it
                    implemented a 32-bit architecture, added more instructions,
                    and supported 4-gigabyte segments. The 386 is a complicated
                    processor (by 1980s standards), with 285,000 transistors,
                    ten times the number of the original 8086.4 The 386 has
                    eight logical units that are pipelined5 and operate mostly
                    autonomously.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The design process of the 386 is interesting because
                    it illustrates Intel's migration to automated design systems
                    and heavier use of simulation.23 At the time, Intel was
                    behind the industry in its use of tools so the leaders of
                    the 386 realized that more automation would be necessary to
                    build a complex chip like the 386 on schedule. By making a
                    large investment in automated tools, the 386 team completed
                    the design ahead of schedule. Along with proprietary CAD
                    tools, the team made heavy use of standard Unix tools such
                    as sed, awk, grep, and make to manage the various design
                    databases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Once the processor was released, the problems weren't
                    over.25 Some early 386 processors had a 32-bit multiply
                    problem, where some arguments would unpredictably produce
                    the wrong results under particular
                    temperature/voltage/frequency conditions. (This is unrelated
                    to the famous Pentium FDIV bug that cost Intel $475
                    million.) The root cause was a layout problem, not a logic
                    problem; they didn't allow enough margin to handle the worst
                    case data in combination with manufacturing process and
                    environment factors. This tricky problem didn't show up in
                    simulation or chip verification, but was only found in
                    stress testing.

                    The Space Age is leaving fingerprints on one of the most
                    remote parts of the planet—the stratosphere—which has
                    potential implications for climate, the ozone layer and the
                    continued habitability of Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using tools hitched to the nose cone of their research
                    planes and sampling more than 11 miles above the planet's
                    surface, researchers have discovered significant amounts of
                    metals in aerosols in the atmosphere, likely from
                    increasingly frequent launches and returns of spacecraft and
                    satellites. That mass of metal is changing atmospheric
                    chemistry in ways that may impact Earth's atmosphere and
                    ozone layer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are finding this human-made material in what we consider
                    a pristine area of the atmosphere," said Dan Cziczo, one of
                    a team of scientists who published a study on these results
                    in the
                    <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>. "And
                    if something is changing in the stratosphere—this stable
                    region of the atmosphere—that deserves a closer look."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cziczo, professor and head of the Department of Earth,
                    Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences in Purdue's College of
                    Science, is an expert in atmospheric science who has spent
                    decades studying this rarefied region.

                    Led by Dan Murphy, an adjunct professor in the Department of
                    Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences and a researcher
                    at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the
                    team detected more than 20 elements in ratios that mirror
                    those used in spacecraft alloys.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found that the mass of lithium, aluminum, copper and
                    lead from spacecraft reentry far exceeded those metals found
                    in natural cosmic dust. Nearly 10% of large sulfuric acid
                    particles—the particles that help protect and buffer the
                    ozone layer—contained aluminum and other spacecraft metals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists estimate that as many as 50,000 more satellites
                    may reach orbit by 2030. The team calculates that means
                    that, in the next few decades, up to half of stratospheric
                    sulfuric acid particles would contain metals from reentry.
                    What effect that could have on the atmosphere, the ozone
                    layer and life on Earth is yet to be understood.

                    Silence might not be deafening, but it's something that
                    literally can be heard, concludes a team of philosophers and
                    psychologists who used auditory illusions to reveal how
                    moments of silence distort people's perception of time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings address the debate of whether people can hear
                    more than sounds, which has puzzled philosophers for
                    centuries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We typically think of our sense of hearing as being
                    concerned with sounds. But silence, whatever it is, is not a
                    sound—it's the absence of sound," said lead author Rui Zhe
                    Goh, a Johns Hopkins University graduate student in
                    philosophy and psychology. "Surprisingly, what our work
                    suggests is that nothing is also something you can hear."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team adapted well-known auditory illusions to create
                    versions in which the sounds of the original illusions were
                    replaced by moments of silence. For example, one illusion
                    made a sound seem much longer than it really was. In the
                    team's new silence-based illusion, an equivalent moment of
                    silence also seemed longer than it really was.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fact that these silence-based illusions produced exactly
                    the same results as their sound-based counterparts suggests
                    that people hear silence just as they hear sounds, the
                    researchers said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "There's at least one thing that we hear that isn't a
                    sound, and that's the silence that happens when sounds go
                    away," said co-author Ian Phillips, a Bloomberg
                    Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Psychological and
                    Brain Sciences. "The kinds of illusions and effects that
                    look like they are unique to the auditory processing of a
                    sound, we also get them with silences, suggesting we really
                    do hear absences of sound too."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings establish a new way to study the perception of
                    absence, the team said.

                    A prominent cryptography expert has told New Scientist that
                    a US spy agency could be weakening a new generation of
                    algorithms designed to protect against hackers equipped with
                    quantum computers.

                    <a href="https://cr.yp.to/djb.html">Daniel Bernstein</a> at
                    the University of Illinois Chicago says that the US National
                    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is deliberately
                    obscuring the level of involvement the US National Security
                    Agency (NSA) has in developing new encryption standards for
                    "post-quantum cryptography" (PQC). He also believes that
                    NIST has made errors – either accidental or deliberate – in
                    calculations describing the security of the new standards.
                    NIST denies the claims.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "NIST isn't following procedures designed to stop NSA from
                    weakening PQC," says Bernstein. "People choosing
                    cryptographic standards should be transparently and
                    verifiably following clear public rules so that we don't
                    need to worry about their motivations. NIST promised
                    transparency and then claimed it had shown all its work, but
                    that claim simply isn't true."

                    Bernstein alleges that NIST's calculations for one of the

                    making it appear more secure than it really is. He says that
                    NIST multiplied two numbers together when it would have been
                    more correct to add them, resulting in an artificially high
                    assessment of Kyber512's robustness to attack.

                    Eastern daylight time."

                    Millions of Canadians grew accustomed to hearing a version
                    of this daily affirmation on CBC Radio One. The National
                    Research Council Time Signal, and the series of 800 Hz
                    "pips" that preceded and followed the time-setting dash,
                    worked its way into everyday rituals. Human listeners, and
                    automated radio receivers at railways, shipping firms, and
                    other entities, could set their mechanical clocks to it.
                    That is why it started broadcasting on November 5, 1939, the
                    same year as Canada's entry into World War II.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The long dash's last broadcast was,

                    Both the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the NRC have
                    cited accuracy as the reason the 84-year ritual was halted.
                    The CBC
                    <a
                      href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/cbc-stops-broadcasting-national-research-council-long-dash-time-signal-1.6988903"

                    >
                    that because the CBC is now heard over satellite and
                    Internet connections, not just terrestrial radio, there are
                    delays when people hear it. A spokesperson acknowledged
                    Canadians' "fondness" for the daily ritual but said it "can
                    no longer ensure that the time announcement can be
                    accurate."

                    repeating the phrase "You're getting sleepy, very sleepy,"
                    giving them absolute command over their subject. That's not

                    depicted in pop culture. Even some clinicians and hypnosis
                    educators propagate harmful myths about hypnosis.

                    made major contributions to the judicial system for his
                    insight on the practice. Lynn believes that hypnosis has
                    many useful clinical applications, but that myths keep it
                    from being utilized to its full potential.

                    A hypnotized person is believed to display "blind
                    obedience," going along automatically with whatever the
                    hypnotist suggests. [...]

                  <p>
                    Hypnosis is often mischaracterized as a "special state" in
                    which defense mechanisms are reduced and a "unique state of
                    physical relaxation and conscious unconsciousness" allows us
                    to enter our subconscious depths through hypnosis. [...]

                  <p><em>People are either hypnotizable or they are not</em></p>
                  <p>
                    Responsiveness to hypnosis can be relatively stable over
                    time. Yet it is inaccurate to assume that people are either
                    hypnotizable or not. [...]

                    Suggested behaviors during hypnosis can seem so much a
                    departure from the mundane that questions inevitably arise
                    regarding whether hypnotic responses are genuine. However,
                    neuroimaging studies reveal that the effects of hypnotic
                    suggestions activate brain regions (e.g, visual processing)
                    consistent with suggested events (e.g., hallucinating an

                    recall extremely accurate memories from a distant past life
                    under hypnosis. But research suggests a contrary view.

                    Stack Overflow used to be every developer's favorite site
                    for coding help, but with the rise of generative AI like
                    ChatGPT, chatbots can offer more specific help than a
                    5-year-old forum post ever could.

                [<em>Paywalled-Subscribers Only</em>] describes how GPT tools
                can be used for some tasks but will reduce the quality of
                workers output in others in a phenomenon dubbed "falling asleep
                behind the wheel".

                Tasks where GPT assisted consultants did better: creative
                business idealization and selling concepts.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i
                  >Participants were required to complete 18 tasks, or as many
                  as they could within the given time frame, across four broad
                  domains: creativity (e.g. "propose at least 10 ideas for a new
                  shoe targeting an underserved market or sport"); analytical
                  thinking (e.g. "segment the footwear industry market based on
                  users"); writing proficiency (e.g. "draft a press release
                  marketing copy for your product"); and persuasiveness (e.g.
                  "pen an inspirational memo to employees detailing why your
                  product would outshine competitors").</i

              </p>
              <p>
                Tasks where relying too much on GPT tools reduced the output
                quality (but was faster): tasks where data analysis was required
                to draw the right conclusion
              </p>
              <p>
                <i

                  company insiders and financial data from a spreadsheet to

                    An advertising industry group urged Comcast to stop its
                    "10G" ads or modify them to state that 10G is an
                    "aspirational" technology rather than something the company
                    actually provides on its cable network today. The National
                    Advertising Division (NAD), part of the advertising
                    industry's self-regulatory system run by BBB National
                    Programs, ruled against Comcast after a challenge lodged by
                    T-Mobile.

                    Thursday, the NAD recommended that Comcast "discontinue its
                    '10G' claims" or "modify its advertising to (a) make clear
                    that it is implementing improvements that will enable it to
                    achieve '10G' and that it is aspirational or (b) use '10G'

                    generated by the wireless industry.

                    In this latest study, physicist Arianna Gleason of Stanford
                    University and colleagues bombarded thin slivers of water,
                    sandwiched between two diamond layers, with some
                    ridiculously powerful lasers.

                    Successive shockwaves raised the pressure to 200 GPa (2
                    million atmospheres) and temperatures up to about 5,000 K
                    (8,500 °F) – hotter than the temperatures of the 2019
                    experiments, but at lower pressures.

                    of [water] at pressure–temperature conditions relevant to
                    their planetary interiors," Gleason and colleagues explain

                    The resulting diffraction patterns confirmed the ice
                    crystals were in fact a new phase distinct from superionic
                    ice observed in 2019. The newly discovered superionic ice,
                    Ice XIX, has a body-centered cubic structure and increased
                    conductivity compared to its predecessor from 2019, Ice

                    Just when you thought it was safe to use your 12VHPWR cable
                    with your RTX 4090 again, another incident of GPU meltdown
                    pops up in the forums. Redditor Byogore reports that he
                    bought an Asus 4090 in Germany a year ago because of US
                    supply issues. The card worked totally fine until it
                    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Byogore"
                      >self-immolated</a
                    >
                    two days ago. This incident is unusual because typically
                    failures have happened much sooner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other Redditors quickly questioned whether Byogore had the
                    connectors seated securely since "user error" was one of
                    Nvidia's excuses when the issue

                    shortly after the RTX4090 launch. Byogore defended his
                    ability to properly attach a computer component.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The fact that the 90-degree cable mod adapter [to
                    prevent bending] was plugged in fully to the connector and
                    the connector still melted, then we know that we have a
                    problem with the card. We have a problem with the card. We
                    do not have a problem with the cable. It's not user error,
                    it's not a cable not plugged in properly problem, it's not a
                    cable mod problem, but it's a problem with the design and
                    the engineering of the card."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NorthridgeFix also points out that even if the problem was
                    caused by user error, it's still Nvidia's fault. For
                    instance, if a user is plugging in a cable as they do with
                    any other, past or present, and it leaves a 1mm gap that
                    causes failure, that is not the user's fault. When there is
                    a tolerance issue like that, it is the manufacturer's
                    responsibility to fix it or design a mechanism to prevent
                    it, not blame the user for not plugging it in correctly and
                    doing nothing more about it.

                    Byogore says that the meltdown happened while he was playing
                    Battlefield 2042. The screen turned black, but the audio
                    continued. Then, the computer rebooted itself. As it started
                    up, he could smell burnt plastic. The card still worked, but
                    only briefly before crashing and burning again. Byogore
                    mentioned that he has a 1,000W Corsair PSU and that the 4090
                    was undervolted at the time of the catastrophic failure.
                    However, he didn't note whether his PSU was ATX 3.0. The
                    problem only seems to occur on older ATX 2.0 power supplies.

                    [...] Nvidia has been reluctant to accept any blame for the
                    4090's hot-button woes. It initially blamed users for not
                    securing the cable tightly to the socket. Later, it said
                    that "<a

                    The team found that fundamental frequency differences by sex
                    increased in larger groups and those with polygynous mating
                    systems, especially in groups with a higher female-to-male
                    ratio. They reported their findings today (July 10) in

                    [...] Deeper male voices may act as an additional way to
                    fend off mating competitors without having to engage in
                    costly fighting by making males sound bigger, in addition to
                    other physical traits like height and muscle size, according
                    to the researchers. In adult humans, for instance, males
                    vocalize at an average of 120 hertz whereas females vocalize
                    at an average of about 220 hertz, putting humans right in
                    the middle of polygynous societies, the researchers
                    reported.

                    "Although social monogamy is really common in humans, mating
                    and reproduction in our ancestors was substantially
                    polygynous," Puts said. "Our findings help us to understand
                    why male and female voices of our species differ so
                    drastically. It may be a product of our evolutionary
                    history, particularly our history of living in large groups
                    in which some males reproduced with multiple females."

                    [...] Among the biggest issues in machine learning is the
                    movement of data. The key data involved are the so-called
                    weights and activations that define the strength of the

                    prioritize this problem by keeping data as close as they can
                    to the processing elements. Researchers have been working on
                    multiple ways to do this, such as moving some of the
                    computing into the memory itself and

                    and the like). In that scheme, the weights are encoded as
                    conductance values in a resistive memory element (RRAM). The
                    RRAM is an integral part of an analog circuit that performs
                    the key machine learning calculation, multiply and
                    accumulate. That computation is done in analog as a simple
                    summation of currents, potentially saving huge amounts of
                    power.

                  <p>
                    IBM’s Geoff Burr explained analog AI in depth in the

                    can tackle transformer models.

                    Another interesting AI scheme coming up at IEDM originates
                    with researchers at Tsinghua University and Peking
                    University. It’s based on a three-layer system that includes
                    a silicon CMOS logic layer, a carbon nanotube transistor and
                    RRAM layer, and another layer of RRAM made from a different
                    material. This combination, they say, solves a data transfer
                    bottleneck in many schemes that seek to lower the power and
                    latency of AI by building computing in memory. In tests it
                    performed a standard image recognition task with the similar
                    accuracy to a GPU but almost 50 times faster and with about
                    1/40th the energy.

                    Recent research has revealed that nearly half a million
                    years ago, ancient human ancestors, predating
                    <em>Homo sapiens</em>, were already engaging in advanced
                    woodworking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The artifacts found indicate that these humans were building
                    structures, potentially laying the foundation of platforms
                    or parts of dwellings, much earlier than what was once
                    believed.
                  </p>

                      >University of Liverpool</a
                    >
                    and Aberystwyth University excavated preserved wood at
                    Kalambo Falls, Zambia, dating back to an impressive 476,000
                    years. Analyzing the stone tool cut marks on the wood, the
                    team deduced that these early humans intentionally shaped
                    and combined two logs, showcasing the deliberate crafting of
                    logs to fit together. Prior to this discovery, humans were
                    believed to only utilize wood for simpler purposes such as
                    creating fire, crafting digging sticks, and making spears.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The preservation of this wood is in itself remarkable.
                    Typically, wood from such ancient times deteriorates and
                    disappears. However, at Kalambo Falls, high water levels

                    These findings cast doubt on the previously held belief that
                    Stone Age humans were strictly nomadic. The abundance of
                    resources in the vicinity of Kalambo Falls suggests that
                    these ancient humans could have settled, tapping into the
                    perennial water source and the surrounding forest for
                    sustenance, allowing them to engage in construction.

                    Professor Larry Barham from the University of Liverpool
                    articulated the significance of this discovery, stating,
                    "They used their intelligence, imagination, and skills to
                    create something they'd never seen before, something that
                    had never previously existed."

                    Given the large development costs and ongoing subsidy, one
                    might start to question why Europe developed the Ariane 6 in
                    the first place. After all, the Ariane 5 has a good success
                    rate and, if it had not been retired earlier this year,
                    would be seeing significant demand on the launch market.
                    Instead, Europe has a gap in its ability to launch medium
                    and large satellites until the Ariane 6 is operationally
                    ready.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another significant downside to all of this is that Europe
                    spent a decade developing a rocket that is
                    <em>somewhat</em> more modern than the Ariane 5 but still
                    performs the same basic function at the same basic price.
                    During that lost decade, SpaceX has amply demonstrated the
                    value of re-flying first stages and has kickstarted a
                    stampede within the launch industry toward reuse. Because it
                    has been focused on the expendable Ariane 6, the European
                    Space Agency has missed out on this opportunity. It is now
                    years behind and only starting basic technology
                    demonstrations rather than bringing a true Falcon 9
                    competitor to market.

                    [...] "There is very little we can do now," Parsonson said.
                    "I know that. Ariane 6 is a pill that we're just going to
                    have to swallow. We cannot cancel the program and any new
                    development would take several years to mature. What we can
                    do, however, is make sure that ArianeGroup is not involved
                    in the future of European launch."

                    The European Space Agency's Euclid space telescope is back
                    to normal and will resume its mission, thanks to a software
                    update that was required after its navigation sensors
                    mistakenly identified solar ray signals as stars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But shortly after its instruments were deployed and it

                    a month later, mission control discovered the telescope was
                    failing to focus on stars. Squiggly lines and circles
                    captured in another image revealed that Euclid was looping
                    around and struggling to lock onto distant stars to keep it
                    steady during its observations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mission control pinpointed the issue and realized the
                    telescope's Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS), which the craft uses
                    to locate a set of landmark stars to help navigate and align
                    its instruments on designated targets, was to blame. The
                    optical sensors were mistakenly identifying photons, ejected
                    by the Sun during periods of high solar activity, as stars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The FGS analyzes light from distant sources and helps
                    control Euclid's orientation. Since it was misinterpreting
                    the solar rays as stars, the telescope was moving
                    haphazardly making it difficult to focus its sight. Working
                    together with aerospace companies Thales Alenia Space and
                    Leonardo, ESA engineers updated its software to change the
                    way its sensors characterize stars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The patch was uploaded to Euclid, and the telescope is now
                    functioning normally. Mission control will continue testing
                    its performance for a little while longer before it
                    officially begins to collect data.

                    "The performance verification phase that was interrupted in
                    August has now fully restarted and all the observations are

                    HTTP2/Rapid Reset is a novel technique for waging DDoS, or
                    distributed denial-of-service attacks, of an unprecedented
                    magnitude. It wasn’t discovered until after it was already
                    being exploited to deliver record-breaking DDoSes. One
                    attack on a customer using the Cloudflare content delivery
                    network peaked at 201 million requests per second, almost
                    triple the previous record Cloudflare had seen of

                      >71 million rps</a
                    >. An attack on a site using Google’s cloud infrastructure
                    topped out at 398 million rps, more than 7.5 times bigger
                    than the previous record Google recorded of 46 million rps.

                    [...] The vulnerability that HTTP/2 Rapid Reset exploits
                    resides in HTTP/2, which went into effect in 2015 and has
                    undergone several overhauls since then. Compared to the
                    HTTP/1 and HTTP/1.1 protocols that predated it, HTTP/2
                    provided the ability for a single HTTP request to carry 100
                    or more “streams” that a server can receive all at once. The
                    resulting throughput can lead to almost 100 times higher
                    utilization of each connection, compared with the earlier
                    HTTP protocols.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The increased efficiency wasn’t just useful for distributing
                    video, audio, and other sorts of benign content. DDoSers
                    began leveraging HTTP/2 to deliver attacks that were orders
                    of magnitude larger. There are two properties in the
                    protocol allowing for these new efficient DDoSes. Before
                    discussing them, it’s useful to review how DDoS attacks work
                    in general and then move on to the way HTTP protocols prior
                    to 2.0 worked.

                    Marks on the ribcage of a 48,000-year-old cave lion skeleton
                    suggest the animal was killed by Neanderthals, making it the
                    first evidence that our nearest human cousins hunted the Ice
                    Age predators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A team of paleoanthropologists and archaeologists recently
                    scrutinized the remains of four lions: the aforementioned
                    skeleton, which was excavated in 1985 in Siegsdorf, Germany,
                    and phalanges and sesamoid bones from three lion specimens
                    excavated from Einhornhöle, Germany, in 2019. The former
                    showed evidence of being punctured by a wooden-tipped
                    spear—a known weapon of Neanderthals—and the latter three
                    had cut marks that suggested they were butchered in a way to
                    keep the animals' claws preserved on the fur. The team's
                    research is published today in Scientific Reports.

                    "The notion that Neanderthals interacted with cave lions
                    holds deep significance," said Gabriele Russo, a
                    paleoanthropologist at Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen
                    and the study's lead author, in an email to Gizmodo. "It
                    reveals that Neanderthals were actively engaged with their
                    environment, which included encounters with formidable
                    creatures like lions. These interactions encompassed not
                    only the cultural use of lion body parts but also the
                    ability to hunt them."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cave lions (Panthera spelaea) are now extinct, but they
                    inhabited most of northern Eurasia during the Pleistocene,
                    recently enough that some preserved cave lions look like
                    they're just sleeping. They made up a remarkable tableau of
                    megafauna on the Ice Age steppe, alongside creatures like
                    the woolly rhinoceros, ancient, extinct elephant species,
                    and the woolly mammoth. And while the mammoth is a known
                    quarry of Neanderthals, it now appears that the human group
                    also hunted cave lions, one of the most prominent Ice Age
                    predators.

                    Speaking to partners last week as part of their annual Open
                    Innovation Platform forum in Europe, a big portion of TSMC's
                    roadshow was dedicated to the next generation of the
                    company's foundry technology. TSMC's 2 nm-class <a

                      >N2P, and N2X process technologies</a
                    > are set to introduce multiple innovations, including
                    nanosheet gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, backside power
                    delivery, and super-high-performance metal-insulator-metal
                    (SHPMIM) capacitor over the next few years. But in order to
                    take advantage of these innovations, TSMC warns, chip
                    designers will need to use all-new electronic design
                    automation (EDA), simulation, and verification tools as well
                    as IP. And while making such a big shift is never an easy
                    task, TSMC is bringing some good news to chip designers
                    early-on: even with N2 still a couple of years out, many of
                    the major EDA tools, verification tools, foundation IP, and
                    even analog IP for N2 are already available for use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Preparations for the start of N2 chip production,
                    scheduled for sometime in the second half of 2025, began
                    long ago. Nanosheet GAA transistors behave differently than
                    familiar FinFETs, so EDA and other tool and IP makers had to
                    build their products from scratch. This is where TSMC's Open
                    Innovation Platform (OIP) demonstrated its prowess and
                    enabled TSMC's partners to start working on their products
                    well in advance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By now, major EDA tools from Cadence and Synopsys as well as
                    many tools from Ansys and Siemens EDA have been certified by
                    TSMC, so chip developers can already use them to design
                    chips. Also, EDA software programs from Cadence and Synopsys
                    are ready for analog design migration. Furthermore,
                    Cadence's EDA tools already support N2P's backside power
                    delivery network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With pre-built IP designs, things are taking a bit longer.
                    TSMC's foundation libraries and IP, including standard
                    cells, GPIO/ESD, PLL, SRAM, and ROM are ready both for
                    mobile and high-performance computing applications.
                    Meanwhile, some PLLs exist in pre-silicon development kits,
                    whereas others are silicon proven. Finally, blocks such as
                    non-volatile memory, interface IP, and even chiplet IP are
                    not yet available - bottlenecking some chip designs - but
                    these blocks in active development or planned for
                    development by companies like Alphawave, Cadence, Credo,
                    eMemory, GUC, and Synopsys, according to a TSMC slide.
                    Ultimately, the ecosystem of tools and libraries for
                    designing 2 nm chips is coming together, but it's not all
                    there quite yet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Although many of the major building blocks for chips
                    are N2-ready, a lot of work still has to be done by many
                    companies before TSMC's 2 nm-class process technologies go
                    into mass production. Large companies, which tend to design
                    (or co-design) IP and development tools themselves are
                    already working on their 2 nm chips, and should be ready
                    with their products by the time mass production starts in 2H
                    2025. Other players can also fire up their design engines
                    because 2 nm preps are well underway at TSMC and its
                    partners.

                    Using "Protect the children!" as their rallying cry, red
                    states are enacting digital pornography restrictions.
                    Texas's effort, H.B. 1181, requires commercial pornographic
                    websites—and others, as we'll see shortly—to verify that
                    their users are adults, and to display state-drafted
                    warnings about pornography's alleged health dangers. In late
                    August, a federal district judge blocked the law from taking
                    effect. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
                    expedited Texas's appeal, and it just held oral argument.
                    This law, or one of the others like it, seems destined for
                    the Supreme Court.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So continues what the Washington Post, in the headline of a
                    1989 op-ed by the columnist Nat Henthoff, once called "<a
                      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1989/01/21/the-eternal-war-against-pornography/be7a041f-2ec8-41f5-a38e-4398bd8ff506/"

                  <p>
                    It's true that the First Amendment does not protect
                    obscenity—which the Supreme Court defines as "prurient" and
                    "patently offensive" material devoid of "serious literary,
                    artistic, political, or scientific value." Like many past
                    anti-porn crusaders, however, Texas's legislators blew past
                    those confines. H.B. 1181 targets material that is obscene
                    to <em>minors</em>. Because "virtually all salacious

                    We hear plenty of legitimate concerns regarding the new wave
                    of generative AI, from the human jobs it could replace to
                    its potential for creating misinformation. But one area that
                    often gets overlooked is the sheer amount of energy these
                    systems use. In the not-so-distant future, the technology
                    could be consuming the same amount of electricity as an
                    entire country.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Alex de Vries, a researcher at the Vrije Universiteit
                    Amsterdam,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2542-4351(23)00365-3"

                    'The Growing Energy Footprint of Artificial Intelligence,'
                    which examines the environmental impact of AI systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    De Vries notes that the training phase for large language
                    models is often considered the most energy-intensive, and
                    therefore has been the focus of sustainability research in
                    AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Following training, models are deployed into a production
                    environment and begin the inference phase. In the case of
                    ChatGPT, this involves generating live responses to user
                    queries. Little research has gone into the inference phase,
                    but De Vries believes there are indications that this period
                    might contribute significantly to an AI model's life-cycle
                    costs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to research firm SemiAnalysis, OpenAI required
                    3,617 Nvidia HGX A100 servers, with a total of 28,936 GPUs,
                    to support ChatGPT, implying an energy demand of 564 MWh per
                    day. For comparison, an estimated 1,287 MWh was used in
                    GPT-3's training phase, so the inference phase's energy
                    demands were considerably higher.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google, which reported that 60% of AI-related energy
                    consumption from 2019 to 2021 stemmed from inference, is
                    integrating AI features into its search engine. Back in

                  <p>
                    [...] "It would be advisable for developers not only to
                    focus on optimizing AI, but also to critically consider the
                    necessity of using AI in the first place, as it is unlikely
                    that all applications will benefit from AI or that the
                    benefits will always outweigh the costs," said De Vries.

                    Regular salt looks like a fine white powder. Sure, it tastes
                    good, but it's not very interesting to look at.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But what if I told you that you could transform the salt
                    sitting in your kitchen into a work of art?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What if I told you that within a few hours, you could turn
                    white, powdery salt into premium salt crystals shaped like
                    pyramids, flowers and Eiffel towers?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Plus, you don't need to be good at art. You don't need to
                    carve those pyramids yourself. Just sit beside the stove,
                    and watch as pyramid salt crystals grow from a dish of salt
                    water right before your eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me show you how to do just that.</p>
                  <p>
                    To my knowledge, it's the only such guide on the Internet.

                    Numerous visual illusions are caused by limits in the way
                    our eyes and visual neurones work – rather than more complex
                    psychological processes,
                    <a
                      href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011117"

                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers examined illusions in which an object's
                    surroundings affect the way we see its colour or pattern.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists and philosophers have long debated whether these
                    illusions are caused by neural processing in the eye and
                    low-level visual centres in the brain, or involve
                    higher-level mental processes such as context and prior
                    knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the new study Dr Jolyon Troscianko, from the University
                    of Exeter, co-developed a model that suggests simple limits
                    to neural responses – not deeper psychological processes –
                    explain these illusions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our eyes send messages to the brain by making neurones fire
                    faster or slower," said Dr Troscianko, from the Centre for
                    Ecology and Conservation on Exeter's Penryn Campus in
                    Cornwall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "However, there's a limit to how quickly they can fire, and
                    previous research hasn't considered how the limit might
                    affect the ways we see colour."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This throws into the air a lot of long-held
                    assumptions about how visual illusions work," Dr Troscianko
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said the findings also shed light on the popularity of
                    high-definition televisions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Modern high dynamic range televisions create bright white
                    regions that are over 10,000 times brighter than their
                    darkest black, approaching the contrast levels of natural
                    scenes," Dr Troscianko added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "How our eyes and brains can handle this contrast is a
                    puzzle because tests show that the highest contrasts we
                    humans can see at a single spatial scale is around 200:1.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Even more confusingly, the neurones connecting our eyes to
                    our brains can only handle contrasts of about 10:1.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our model shows how neurones with such limited contrast
                    bandwidth can combine their signals to allow us to see these
                    enormous contrasts, but the information is 'compressed' –
                    resulting in visual illusions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Ultimately this shows how a system with a severely
                    limited neural bandwidth and sensitivity can perceive
                    contrasts larger than 10,000:1."

                    release announcing the lawsuit today. He said the app
                    “illegally baits children into addictive and unhealthy use”
                    with features that encourage young users to scroll endlessly

                  <p>
                    The lawsuit alleges that TikTok violates the Utah Consumer
                    Sales Practices Act (UCSPA) by making the app addictive to
                    children and profiting from it; misrepresenting things like
                    the safety of its app and fairness of its policies; and
                    claiming that it’s based in the US and not controlled from

                I thought this was an interesting, albeit extreme, example of
                how the data that phone software harvests can be used for evil
                purposes. In this case it's a loan software that harvests
                contact data.

                    There are many apps that promise hassle-free loans in
                    minutes. Not all of them are predatory. But many - once
                    downloaded - harvest your contacts, photos and ID cards, and
                    use that information later to extort you.

                    When customers don't repay on time - and sometimes even when
                    they do - they share this information with a call centre
                    where young agents of the gig economy, armed with laptops
                    and phones are trained to harass and humiliate people into

                    whore. When they threatened to tarnish her daughter's

                    The flight laser transceiver and ground-based laser
                    transmitter will need to point with great precision.
                    Reaching their targets will be akin to hitting a dime from a
                    mile away while the dime is moving. So the transceiver needs
                    to be isolated from the spacecraft vibrations, which would
                    otherwise nudge the laser beam off target. Initially, Psyche
                    will aim the flight transceiver in the direction of Earth
                    while autonomous systems on the flight transceiver assisted
                    by the Table Mountain uplink beacon laser will control the
                    pointing of the downlink laser signal to Palomar
                    Observatory.

                    Integrated onto the Hale Telescope is a cryogenically cooled
                    superconducting nanowire photon-counting array receiver,
                    developed by JPL. The instrument is equipped with high-speed
                    electronics for recording the time of arrival of single
                    photons so that the signal can be decoded. The DSOC team
                    even developed new signal-processing techniques to squeeze
                    information out of the weak laser signals that will have
                    been transmitted over tens to hundreds of millions of miles.

                    In 2013, NASA's Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration
                    tested record-breaking uplink and downlink data rates
                    between Earth and the moon. In 2021, NASA's Laser
                    Communications Relay Demonstration launched to test
                    high-bandwidth optical communications relay capabilities
                    from geostationary orbit so that spacecraft don't require a
                    direct line of sight with Earth to communicate. And last
                    year, NASA's TeraByte InfraRed Delivery system downlinked
                    the highest-ever data rate from a satellite in low-Earth
                    orbit to a ground-based receiver.

                    DSOC is taking optical communications into deep space,
                    paving the way for high-bandwidth communications beyond the
                    moon and 1,000 times farther than any optical communications
                    test to date. If it succeeds, the technology could lead to
                    high-data rate communications with streaming,
                    high-definition imagery that will help support humanity's
                    next giant leap: when NASA sends astronauts to Mars.

                While there are a number of small robot lawn mowers on the
                market, I think they mostly mow randomly inside a fenced off
                area (the fence may be a buried wire with an AC carrier signal?)
                Designed for mowing one residential lawn, and not using any sort
                of optimal mowing path.

                Now Honda is demoing a battery powered zero-turn mower that can
                be trained by a human mowing a big lawn once. Multiple mowing
                jobs can be stored in memory for future playback.

                They claim various AI features, but from the looks of it, this
                is limited to safety--stopping if the machine senses people
                and/or new objects in the stored mowing path. From the YT text:

                    Capable of operating in manual or autonomous mode, when
                    manually operated, the Honda AWM learns the mowing routes
                    and patterns set by the operator. In autonomous operation,
                    the AWM reproduces these routes and patterns, which can free
                    up workers' time to focus on more high-value tasks.

                Prediction for the next generation of AI mower--automatically
                re-works the internal mowing path each mow to keep from leaving
                tell-tale patterns in the grass. Of course each path is
                optimized, so all these different patterns take about the same
                time to mow the given lawn.

                    "VBScript is being deprecated," Microsoft said. "In future

                    VBScript debuted in 1996 and its most recent release,
                    version 5.8, dates back

                    used among system administrators to automate tasks until it

                    Unfortunately, Microsoft never managed to get other browser
                    makers to support VBScript, so outside of
                    Microsoft-exclusive environments, web developers tended to
                    favor JavaScript for client-side tasks.

                    One of the most vital parts of the Psyche mission will be
                    getting the spacecraft to this distant asteroid and then
                    keeping it in place so its scientific instruments can do
                    their jobs.

                  <p>
                    To do this, the spacecraft, which measures 16.1 by 7.1 by
                    7.8 feet (4.9 by 2.2 by 2.4 meters), will depend on a solar
                    electric propulsion system that captures sunlight with its
                    large solar arrays and then converts it to electric and
                    magnetic fields. These fields accelerate charged atoms of
                    the propellant xenon ,  which is commonly found in plasma
                    televisions on Earth. These

                    >, in the form of blue-glowing ionized gas, are then blasted
                    out into space by the Psyche spacecraft's four thrusters,
                    providing the craft with propulsion that looks like
                    something straight out of science fiction.
                  </p>

                      >According to NASA</a
                    >, each of these four thrusters operates one at a time,
                    providing a force equivalent to the weight of three quarters
                    in your hand here on Earth — which, in the microgravity and
                    frictionless environment of space, is enough to propel the
                    spacecraft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even with these revolutionary "Hall-effect thrusters" —
                    which, so far, have been used to get only as far as the moon
                    — the spacecraft's journey to the vicinity of Jupiter won't
                    be a 'straight shot." Instead, it will require a
                    gravity-assisted slingshot maneuver around Mars in 2026, and
                    Psyche will arrive at its metal-rich asteroid target in
                    August 2029.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spacecraft will then make orbits of the asteroid at a
                    distance of around 430 miles (700 km), which will decrease
                    as the mission proceeds. The spacecraft will use
                    progressively closer orbital periods ,  or "regimes ,"  to
                    investigate different characteristics of the asteroid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During its first orbital regime (A), lasting 56 days, the
                    spacecraft will use its magnetometer to search Psyche for an
                    ancient magnetic field, which would provide evidence that
                    the asteroid was once a planetary body. As the spacecraft
                    does this, its multispectral imager will assess the
                    topography of Psyche's surface. This will continue as the
                    NASA orbiter draws closer to the asteroid, hopefully
                    revealing more details of these characteristics,
                    particularly during the next two orbital regimes (B1 and
                    B2), which will last 192 days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moving even closer to the asteroid, during the 100-day
                    orbital regime C, Psyche's telecommunications system, which
                    sends data to Earth and receives commands from ground
                    control via radio waves, will be used to investigate the
                    gravitational influence of the metal-rich asteroid. This
                    could help better constrain its mass and density and thus
                    the asteroid's interior composition and structure.

                    In the short story Chains (1929), the Hungarian writer
                    Frigyes Karinthy described a game where a group of people
                    were discussing how the members of the human society were
                    closer together than ever before. To prove this point, one
                    participant proposes that any person out of the entire Earth
                    population (around 1.8 billion at that time) could be
                    reached using nothing except each personal network of
                    acquaintances, betting that the resulting chain would be of
                    no more than five individuals. The story coined the
                    expression "six degrees of separation" to reflect the idea
                    that all people of the world are six or fewer social
                    connections apart from each other. The concept was later
                    generalized to that of "small-world" networks, where the
                    maximal social distance (the diameter of the network) scales
                    logarithmically, rather than linearly, with the size of the
                    population.

                    [...] One of the most intriguing and captivating features of
                    social networks is that they are organized so that no
                    individual is more than six connections apart from any
                    other, an empirical regularity known as the six degrees of
                    separation. Why social networks have this ultrasmall world
                    organization—where the diameter of a graph of the network is
                    independent of the network size over several orders of
                    magnitude—is still unknown. Our study shows that this
                    property is the direct consequence of the dynamical
                    evolution of any network structure where individuals weigh
                    their aspiration to improve their centrality against the
                    costs incurred in forming or maintaining connections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We look at the evolution of a graph whose growth is governed
                    by a simple compensation rule. This rule balances the cost
                    incurred by nodes in maintaining connections and the benefit
                    accrued by the chosen links. In this case, the graph's
                    asymptotic equilibrium state (a Nash equilibrium, where no
                    further actions would produce more benefit than cost)
                    features a diameter that, irrespective of the network's
                    initial connectivity structure, does not depend on the
                    system's size and is equal to six.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our study points out that evolutionary rules of the kind
                    traditionally associated with human cooperation and altruism
                    can in fact account also for the emergence of the six
                    degrees of separation in social networks.

                    [...] Part of the draw of Imagetwin, specialists say, is
                    that it looks for duplications in two ways. The software
                    makes "something like a fingerprint" for every image in a
                    paper, says Patrick Starke, one of its developers. It then
                    scans the entire paper for repeats of that fingerprint. It
                    also scans its large database to see whether that
                    fingerprint appears in past papers — a process that takes
                    only five to ten seconds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The end goal, Christopher says, is to incorporate AI
                    tools such as Imagetwin into the paper-review process, just
                    as many publishers routinely use software to scan text for
                    plagiarism. But AI on its own isn't enough. "You have to use
                    your own expertise and question these things. None of the
                    flags you receive [from Imagetwin] are a definite 'This is
                    fraud,'" she says.

                  <p>
                    [...] Christopher hopes that the roll-out of more AI tools
                    could democratize the ability for journals to screen papers.
                    "I think we need to shed the idea that it's a luxury — it
                    actually adds value to the journal."

                    That sort of potential attack means that Microsoft needs to
                    be very careful exactly what to enable in Windows Copilot,
                    and how to enable it. Unfortunately, the strange-loop nature
                    of AI chatbots means that it's difficult – maybe even
                    impossible – to game out every possible attack scenario.
                    Human language is just too weird, and the AI chatbots
                    themselves are still very poorly understood.

              <h3>Copilot Deficit. MS Losing Money Per User.</h3>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                Microsoft is apparently losing $20 per user per month that
                installs and pays the subscription fee ($10/month) to use
                Copilot. You have got to be fairly desperate to gain market
                share if you are willing to sell it at a loss. Or they want to
                hook customers early to later hike the price, as per usual.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps more importantly, are you getting your subfees worth of
                code or help per month?<br />Is the loss real tho? After all
                they are hooking a developer to their service and they are
                gaining code and data every month to feed into their machine.
                Most of that code is probably from the Copilot so it's feeding
                itself on itself, creating delusions or AI induced
                hallucinations. Eventually it will start to believe it's own
                code.

                    As the WSJ notes, individuals pay $10 per month for GitHub
                    Copilot, but multiple sources told it that the service loses
                    an average of $20 per user per month, with some users
                    costing Microsoft as much as $80 per month. So it's likely
                    that this situation played a role in the company's decision
                    to charge a lot more for the AI capabilities it will soon
                    provide via Microsoft 365 Copilot. That service will cost
                    customers $30 per user per month on top of the normal
                    monthly Microsoft 365 subscription fee (which varies by
                    tier). It's not coincidental that Google will charge an
                    identical additional per-user fee for its similar Duet AI
                    offering.

                    intriguing, given Unity's recent history. After announcing a

                    promised never to do such a thing.

                ATARI releasing a "new" game for the 2600 console. 46 years in
                development, there wasn't just active development, have got to
                be some kind of record in and by itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sold in the classic box and cartridge form. Clearly targeting
                the collector-market since it's just 500 copies. I'm not sure
                you'll get your $60 worth tho. It doesn't look very good or
                appear to be overly interesting as a game. It's not Pitfall.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps this isn't a surprise, or should come as one. After all
                it seems the game market today is in large just remaking the
                same titles over and over again, remaking and "updating"
                previous titles etc. In that sense starting to release games for
                long dead consoles is perhaps not that far fetched.

                    Scientists have for the first time observed the early
                    universe running in extreme slow motion, unlocking one of
                    the mysteries of Einstein's expanding universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Einstein's general theory of relativity means that we should
                    observe the distant – and hence ancient – universe running
                    much slower than the present day. However, peering back that
                    far in time has proven elusive. Scientists have now cracked
                    that mystery by using quasars as 'clocks'.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Looking back to a time when the universe was just over a
                    billion years old, we see time appearing to flow five times
                    slower," said lead author of the study, Professor Geraint
                    Lewis from the School of Physics and Sydney Institute for
                    Astronomy at the University of Sydney.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If you were there, in this infant universe, one second
                    would seem like one second – but from our position, more
                    than 12 billion years into the future, that early time
                    appears to drag."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Thanks to Einstein, we know that time and space are
                    intertwined and, since the dawn of time in the singularity
                    of the Big Bang, the universe has been expanding," Professor
                    Lewis said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This expansion of space means that our observations of the
                    early universe should appear to be much slower than time
                    flows today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Professor Lewis worked with astro-statistician Dr
                    Brewer to examine details of 190 quasars observed over two
                    decades. Combining the observations taken at different
                    colours (or wavelengths) – green light, red light and into
                    the infrared – they were able to standardise the 'ticking'
                    of each quasar. Through the application of Bayesian
                    analysis, they found the expansion of the universe imprinted
                    on each quasar's ticking.

                  <p>
                    "With these exquisite data, we were able to chart the tick
                    of the quasar clocks, revealing the influence of expanding
                    space," Professor Lewis said.

                    "Despite timely written demand along with documentation from
                    Plaintiffs through their counsel, the Company has not
                    advanced to Plaintiffs their Expenses actually and
                    reasonably incurred related to the various Proceedings," the
                    lawsuit said. "Over two months after Plaintiffs' initial
                    written demand, the Company offered only a cursory
                    acknowledgment of receipt, but still refused to acknowledge

                    According to Bloomberg, X "has paid about $600,000 of what
                    it owes, but has withheld $1,158,427 in fees for lawyers'
                    work representing the former top managers." An X lawyer
                    argued that fees related to Gadde's testimony in front of
                    Congress were too high, the Bloomberg story said:

                    Michael Blanchard, one of the company's lawyers, said X
                    officials got "sticker shock" when they got the bill from
                    Gadde's lawyers, which they found to be "quite excessive."
                    Blanchard said the fees weren't for litigation "that's going
                    to go for several years," but instead were for "one day of
                    testimony." X officials considered the request a "clear
                    abuse" of the ﬁrm's legal duty to indemnify executives for
                    work on behalf of the company.

                    Tech jobs, once a fairly safe and lucrative bet, have become
                    more elusive. In 2022 and 2023, tech companies around the
                    world laid off more than 400,000 workers, according to
                    <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/">Layoffs.fyi</a>, a site that
                    tracks job losses across the industry. Tens of thousands of
                    those cuts have come from huge employers like Meta and
                    Amazon, and some firms have instituted hiring freezes. The
                    layoffs have been particularly brutal for immigrant workers,
                    who have been left scrambling for sponsorship in the US
                    after losing work.

                  <p>
                    The controversy at the Grace Hopper Celebration shows the
                    fallout of those job losses, as women and non-binary people
                    still struggle to find equal footing in an industry
                    dominated by men. Women made up just a third of those

                    people who know the profile ID of a user to view that user's
                    profile photo, name, birth year, and location. The 23andMe
                    representative said that "anyone who a 23andMe account who
                    has opted into DNA Relatives can view basic profile

                    if a user chooses a strong password and uses two-factor
                    authentication as 23andMe has long urged, their data can
                    still be swept up in scraping incidents like the one
                    recently confirmed. The only sure way to protect it from
                    online theft is to not store it there in the first place.
