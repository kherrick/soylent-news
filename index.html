                    before the package pierces Earth's atmosphere, flight
                    controllers will make a decision about whether to proceed
                    with the separation of the capsule from its spacecraft,

                    After the spacecraft releases the capsule about 63,000 miles

                        encouraging users to do things in a particular way and
                        discouraging them from other things, such as putting

                  <p>Insufficient packaging capacity is to blame.</p>
                  <p>
                    The chairman of TSMC admitted that the ongoing short supply
                    of compute GPUs for artificial intelligence (AI) and
                    high-performance computing (HPC) applications is caused
                    by constraints of its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS)
                    packaging capacity. This shortage is expected to persist for
                    around 18 months due to rising demand for generative AI
                    applicationsand relatively slow expansion of CoWoS capacity
                    at TSMC.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It is not the shortage of AI chips, it is the shortage of
                    our CoWoS capacity," said Mark Liu, the chairman of TSMC,
                    <a
                      href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-sees-AI-chip-output-constraints-lasting-1.5-years"
                      >in a conversation with Nikkei</a
                    > at Semicon Taiwan. "Currently, we cannot fulfill 100% of
                    our customers' needs, but we try to support about 80%. We
                    think this is a temporary phenomenon. After our expansion of
                    [advanced chip packaging capacity], it should be alleviated
                    in one and a half years."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    TSMC is the producer of the majority of AI processors,
                    including Nvidia's A100 and H100 compute GPUs that are
                    integral to AI tools like ChatGPT and are predominantly used
                    in AI data centers. These processors, just like solutions
                    from other players like AMD, AWS, and Google, use HBM memory
                    (which is essential for high
                    bandwidth and proper functioning of extensive AI language
                    models) and CoWoS packaging, which puts additional strain on
                    TSMC's advanced packaging facilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Liu said that demand for CoWoS surged unexpectedly earlier
                    this year, tripling year-over-year, leading to the current
                    supply constraints. TSMC recognizes that demand
                    for generative AI services is growing and so is demand for
                    appropriate hardware, so it is speeding up expansion of
                    CoWoS capacity to meet demand for compute GPUs as well as
                    specialized AI accelerators and processors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At present, the company is installing additional tools for
                    CoWoS at its existing advanced packaging facilities, but
                    this takes time and the company expects its CoWoS capacity
                    to double only by the end of 2024.

                    "Acute coffee consumption decreased the functional
                    connectivity between brain regions of the default mode
                    network, a network that is associated with self-referential
                    processes when participants are at rest," said Dr Maria
                    Picó-Pérez of Jaume I University, first author. [...] In
                    simple words, the subjects were more ready for action and
                    alert to external stimuli after having coffee."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Taking into account that some of the effects that we found
                    were reproduced by caffeine, we could expect other
                    caffeinated drinks to share some of the effects," added
                    Picó-Pérez. "However, others were specific for coffee
                    drinking, driven by factors such as the particular smell and
                    taste of the drink, or the psychological expectation
                    associated with consuming that drink."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The authors pointed out that it is possible that the
                    experience of drinking coffee without caffeine could cause
                    these benefits: this study could not differentiate the
                    effects of the experience alone from the experience combined
                    with the caffeine. There is also a hypothesis that the
                    benefits coffee-drinkers claim could be due to the relief of
                    withdrawal symptoms, which this study did not test.

                    Some coastal communities have proved aggressively resistant
                    to increasing density, boosting affordable housing and
                    allowing more development. That has left inland exurbs as
                    drivers of new housing, even though they are significantly
                    hotter and require long commutes to job centers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We likely need more policy to better integrate the state's
                    housing affordability policies in concert with our climate
                    strategies," Subin said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Compact development near the coasts," he said, can "reduce
                    emissions across sectors." In these types of development,
                    residents drive less, building energy use is lower—partially
                    due to less extreme heat—and undeveloped land inland can be
                    left undisturbed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Subin said California's coastal cities still have plenty of
                    room to grow. "It's not a technical limitation, it's a
                    policy choice that we have chosen to reserve much of our
                    [coastal] cities for surface parking lots, for exclusive
                    single-family home zoning," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Subin said that adding density to already existing
                    cities in the North Coast could make sense, but in terms of
                    creating a planned mega-city, there's "not a great track
                    record for that around the world."

                AARO (All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office) have released a
                report on the most common UFO observation spots going back 27
                years. So what happened 28 years ago?
              </p>
              <p>
                Also there seems to be a band around the earth where they appear
                to like to visit. Japan, Saudi Arabia, northern Florida,
                California, Arizona and Nevada.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most common shape are various forms of round shapes such as
                orbs, spheres and circles.
              </p>

                No info on which alien type, what they are doing here or what
                they like for dinner and entertainment -- but from previous
                news/stories/eyewitnesses I guess they are into probing and BBQ.

                    In a new report, the federal department charged with
                    analyzing how efficiently US taxpayer dollars are spent, the
                    Government Accountability Office, says NASA lacks
                    transparency on the true costs of its Space Launch System
                    rocket program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Published on Thursday, the new report (<a
                      href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105609.pdf"
                      >see .pdf</a
                    >) examines the billions of dollars spent by NASA on the
                    development of the massive rocket, which made a successful
                    debut launch in late 2022 with the Artemis I mission.
                    Surprisingly, as part of the reporting process, NASA
                    officials admitted the rocket was too expensive to support
                    its lunar exploration efforts as part of the Artemis
                    program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Senior NASA officials told GAO that at current cost levels,
                    the SLS program is unaffordable," the new report states.<br />[...]<br />NASA
                    recently said that it is working with the primary contractor
                    of the SLS rocket's main engines, Aerojet, to reduce the
                    cost of each engine by 30 percent, down to $70.5 million by
                    the end of this decade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, NASA's inspector general, Paul Martin,
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/05/a-new-report-finds-nasa-has-spent-an-obscene-amount-of-money-on-sls-propulsion/"
                      >said this claim was dubious</a
                    >. According to Martin, when calculating the projected cost
                    savings of the new RS-25 engines, NASA and Aerojet only
                    included material, engineering support, and touch labor,
                    while project management and overhead costs are excluded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And even at $70.5 million, these engines are very, very far
                    from being affordable compared to the existing US commercial
                    market for powerful rocket engines. Blue Origin manufactures
                    an engine of comparable power and size, the BE-4, for less
                    than $20 million. And SpaceX is seeking to push the
                    similarly powerful Raptor rocket engine costs even lower, to
                    less than $1 million per engine.

                    "The vehicle’s structural margins appear to be better than
                    we expected," SpaceX CEO Elon Musk joked with reporters in
                    the wake of the late April test launch. Per the a report
                    from the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/documents/5-12-2022%20SpaceX%20Final%20BCO_signed%20with%20appendix%20A-D.pdf"

                    >, however, the failed launch resulted in a 385-acre debris
                    field that saw concrete chunks flung more than 2,600 feet
                    from the launchpad, a 3.5-acre wildfire and "a plume cloud
                    of pulverized concrete that deposited material up to 6.5
                    miles northwest of the pad site.”

                  <p>
                    "Corrective actions include redesigns of vehicle hardware to
                    prevent leaks and fires, redesign of the launch pad to
                    increase its robustness, incorporation of additional reviews
                    in the design process, additional analysis and testing of
                    safety critical systems and components including the
                    Autonomous Flight Safety System, and the application of
                    additional change control practices," the FAA release reads.
                    Furthermore, the FAA says that SpaceX will have to not only
                    complete that list but also apply for and receive a
                    modification to its existing license "that addresses all
                    safety, environmental and other applicable regulatory
                    requirements prior to the next Starship launch." In short,
                    SpaceX has reached the "finding out" part.

                    [...] "SpaceX is also implementing a full suite of system
                    performance upgrades unrelated to any issues observed during
                    the first flight test," the blog reads. Those improvements
                    include a new hot-stage separation system which will more
                    effectively decouple the first and second stages, a new
                    electronic "Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system" for its
                    Raptor heavy rockets, and "significant upgrades" to the
                    orbital launch mount and pad system which just so happened
                    to have failed in the first test but is, again, completely
                    unrelated to this upgrade. Whether those improvements
                    overlap with the 63 that the FAA is imposing, could not be
                    confirmed at the time of publication as the FAA had not
                    publically released them.

                      >according to a filing by its interim CEO</a
                    >, which you really should read in full, the company offers
                    an "all-in-one solution for customers that remains unmatched
                    in the marketplace." A large problem, among more
                    run-of-the-mill crypto economy problems such as "lack of
                    operational and spending oversight" and "regulatory issues,"
                    is the fact that it lost access to a physical wallet it was
                    keeping a tens of millions of dollars in, and cannot get
                    back into it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In March of 2018, the Company created cold-storage wallets
                    for purposes of maintaining cryptocurrency assets that
                    included ETH, BTC, and ERC-20 compliant cryptocurrencies,"
                    the company wrote in its filing. It called one of these
                    wallets the "98f Wallet," because its address ended in
                    "98f."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To enhance security, the Company set up the 98f Wallet so
                    that those who can 'sign' (i.e., approve) transactions would
                    need to be in physical possession of hand-held Trezor or
                    Ledger hardware devices," the filing says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The filing then states that, if the wallet is lost, most
                    users create "seed phrases" that serve as backup codes that
                    allow people to get into the wallet virtually: "Many users
                    store seed phrases on hard copies of handwritten paper,
                    images, and pictures. If a user loses both the hardware
                    device and the seed phrases, it is virtually impossible for
                    that user to regain access to the digital wallet."
                  </p>
                  <p>You can probably see where this is going.</p>

                    Over time, Mercola amassed 300,000 subscribers to a YouTube
                    channel that "garnered 50 million views" by boosting
                    professionally made videos that linked to his website,
                    "which promotes natural health and provides health articles,
                    optimal wellness products, medical news, and a free
                    newsletter."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers and regulators described Mercola's background to
                    The New York Times a little differently. They claimed that
                    he was at one point the "most influential spreader of
                    coronavirus misinformation" and profited "from misleading
                    claims about Covid-19 vaccines."<br />[...]<br />His attempt
                    to appeal YouTube's decision was denied, according to
                    Beeler's order. At that point, YouTube told Mercola that
                    after reviewing his channel "carefully," YouTube "confirmed
                    that it violates our Community Guidelines."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We won't be putting your channel back up on YouTube," the
                    email said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With no other option to fight back, Mercola sued, alleging
                    that YouTube had failed to provide "advance notice of the
                    vaccine-misinformation policy before terminating the channel
                    and account," warn Mercola of the termination or act fairly
                    and in good faith. He also claimed that YouTube failed to
                    give him access to his content, which he claimed that
                    YouTube's terms of use required. Finally, he said that
                    YouTube had been unjustly enriched for retaining his content
                    and converting it exclusively to YouTube's use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Beeler rejected all these arguments, agreeing with YouTube
                    that there was no breach of contract, no damages should be
                    awarded, and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act
                    barred Mercola's claims.

                    letter reads. "And while Internet crimes against children
                    are already being actively prosecuted, we are concerned that
                    AI is creating a new frontier for abuse that makes such

                    Midjourney, DALL-E, and Adobe Firefly all have built-in
                    filters that bar the creation of pornographic content.)

                    reads, "as anyone can download the AI tools to their
                    computer and create images by simply typing in a short
                    description of what the user wants to see. And because many
                    of these AI tools are 'open source,' the tools can be run in

                    Microsoft is alerting users and system administrators that

                    in upcoming Windows releases, as announced in the Windows
                    message center. This change is only for future versions of
                    Windows and newer Windows 11 releases, as indicated by
                    Redmond. It applies to both client and server editions, but
                    current versions of Windows will remain unaffected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] TLS 1.0 (introduced in 1999) and TLS 1.1 (introduced
                    in 2006) have long been outperformed by TLS 1.2 and 1.3.
                    Modern internet software's TLS implementations are
                    engineered to attempt a connection using the highest
                    available protocol version. Data indicates that the usage of
                    TLS 1.0 and 1.1 is relatively low currently. Microsoft is
                    evidently striving to enhance the security of the Windows
                    platform by promoting the adoption of contemporary
                    protocols.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Consequently, starting with the Windows 11 Insider Preview
                    builds set for release in September 2023, TLS versions 1.0
                    and 1.1 will be disabled by default. This change will also
                    be seen in Windows 12 and subsequent versions. Microsoft has
                    conducted tests on TLS deprecation and identified a
                    "non-exhaustive" list of applications that are dependent on
                    TLS 1.0 or 1.1. This list features older versions of SQL
                    Server, Turbo Tax, BlueStacks, ACDSee Photo Studio, among
                    others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft clarified that most contemporary applications
                    support TLS 1.2 or higher versions, so the majority of users
                    should face no issues. However, if an application does
                    encounter problems, forthcoming updates for Windows 11 and
                    Windows 12 will offer an option to reactivate the older
                    protocols through a modification to the System Registry.

                    Today, the Mozilla Foundation published its analysis of how
                    well automakers handle the privacy of data collected by
                    their connected cars, and the results will be unlikely to
                    surprise any regular reader of Ars Technica. The researchers
                    <a
                      href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/"
                      >were horrified by their findings</a
                    >, stating that "cars are the worst product category we have
                    ever reviewed for privacy."<br />[...]<br />For example,
                    Nissan's privacy policy says it can collect "sensitive
                    personal information, including driver's license number,
                    national or state identification number, citizenship status,
                    immigration status, race, national origin, religious or
                    philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, sexual activity,
                    precise geolocation, health diagnosis data, and genetic
                    information," although it's unlikely your car knows whether
                    you're getting busy in the back seat. While this might be
                    technically possible with a car fitted with a camera-based
                    driver-monitoring system, Nissan's privacy policy notes the
                    data source for the quoted paragraph as "direct contact with
                    users and Nissan employees."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (Although more sophisticated driver-monitoring systems that
                    claim to detect emotional states
                    <a

                    >, we're unaware of any that are in production.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mozilla found plenty more to worry about. Eighty-four
                    percent of the brands they analyzed said they can share your
                    data, and 76 percent said they can sell it. And more than
                    half say they'll share data with the government and law
                    enforcement by request.

                    The Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television
                    and Radio Artists has authorized its members employed in the
                    interactive media industry at giant games studios –
                    including Activision, Epic Games, and Electronic Arts – to

                    >, Guild president Fran Drescher said AI is partly to blame
                    for the impasse. The statement explains that plenty of work
                    covered by the Interactive Media Agreement is "performance
                    capture" in which artists, some of them stunt performers,
                    "provide digitally captured performances used to give
                    expressive movement to video game characters."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using AI to replace those performances "poses an enormous
                    threat to these artists' professions," the Guild asserts.

                  <p>
                    [...] The Guild wants AI protections for its members, and an
                    initial wage rise of 11 percent dated to the expiration of
                    the current deal, plus four percent increases in the second
                    and third years of a new deal. The Guild argues those hikes
                    are "necessary for members' wages to keep up with
                    inflation."

                    Authorizing the strike doesn't mean it will happen – the
                    Guild's announcement simply means members head into their
                    next round of negotiations, from late September, with
                    approval to withdraw labor.

                    the outfits she represents want to reach a fair deal that

                    [...] The concurrent strikes by actors and writers are
                    already kicking holes in broadcasters' and streamers'
                    schedules. Some shows have been suspended indefinitely and
                    others – like the planned Apple TV series Metropolis, based
                    on the classic sci-fi film – have been cancelled outright.

                    If games suffer the same fate, that could make for a poor
                    holiday season – the peak sales period for game publishers –
                    if not this year, then perhaps in 2024 given the long
                    development cycle required to produce premium games.

                    The risk of running obsolete code and hardware was
                    highlighted after attackers exfiltrated data from a UK
                    supplier of high-security fencing for military bases. The
                    initial entry point? A Windows 7 PC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the supplier, Wolverhampton-based Zaun, said it
                    believed that no classified information was downloaded,
                    reports indicated that attackers were able to obtain data
                    that could be used to gain access to some of the UK's most
                    sensitive military and research sites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The LockBit Ransom group conducted the attack on the
                    company's network, and Zaun admitted the group may have
                    exfiltrated 10GB of data. The company also confessed that
                    the attack might have reached its server beyond the Windows
                    7 entry point.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Zaun specializes in high-security perimeter fencing.
                    It isn't a government-approved security contractor, although
                    is approved for government use via the Centre for the
                    Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI). The fact it
                    has fallen victim to a cyberattack and had data downloaded
                    is a reminder for enterprises and organizations to be
                    vigilant regarding every link in the supply chain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company boasts: "All our fencing systems can be designed
                    and manufactured with a wide variety of security additions,
                    including toppings and detection technology to complete your
                    perimeter." Unless, it appears, your perimeter is running
                    some distinctly outdated kit.

                  <p>
                    [...] Paul Brucciani, Cyber Security Advisor at WithSecure,
                    noted the success of LockBit, saying: "The significance of
                    this attack is that by undermining IT security, it is also
                    possible to undermine the physical security of its [the
                    supplier] customers."

                    intensive agriculture. "This is a recent assumption that is

                    see more and more how much potential there is outside of

                    'how' you manage a farm is for biodiversity."

                    "We believe the findings of our research are new to science,
                    but in a sense, it merely confirms what Indigenous
                    communities around the world have already known for a long
                    time, which is that humans can and should have reciprocal

                    Gigabyte has released new firmware and an updated version of
                    the Gigabyte Control Center (GCC) software for the company's
                    Intel motherboards to solve a peculiar bug that corrupts the

                    memory modules. Fortunately, the issue only affects the
                    information on the SPD and will not damage the integrity of
                    the memory modules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There were some user reports on the Baidu Tieba community in
                    China about persistent memory issues with Gigabyte
                    motherboards based on Intel's 600- and 700-series chipsets.
                    After a month of usage,
                    <a href="https://tieba.baidu.com/p/8568000894">one user</a>
                    stated how his Z790 Aorus Elite AX motherboard stopped
                    detecting one of the DDR5 memory modules. When he finally
                    got it to recognize the memory module, it was showing as
                    having a capacity of 384GB, which was hilarious and scary at
                    the same time. Later, one of the memory kit's XMP profiles
                    disappeared, and then the DDR5-6000 profile had its timings
                    replaced to 1-36-104-194. According to the user, he had
                    replaced the "faulty" memory times, but the outcome was the
                    same. The problem was erratic. Sometimes, it would present
                    itself after a month, sometimes after a week, or after a
                    couple of days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another
                    <a href="https://tieba.baidu.com/p/8566260317"
                      >Gigabyte motherboard owner</a
                    >
                    reported similar behaviors on his system. He constantly
                    suffered from system crashes and noted that after one of the
                    incidents, his memory lost the AMD EXPO profile. In another
                    episode, the motherboard corrupted the DDR5-6800 XMP profile
                    with ludicrous timings, such as 34-153-0-0.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Chinese netizens had labeled the problem as the
                    notorious "burning memory issue" because, at first, many
                    thought that Gigabyte motherboards were burning up and
                    killing the DDR5 memory modules since the system got to a
                    point where it wouldn't boot properly. It may sound like an
                    overreaction at the time, but luckily, the issue only
                    botches the memory timings and not the DRAM voltage. If it
                    did, the result would have been different. As per Gigabyte,
                    the memory should be fine. It's just that the SPD is messed
                    up, and obviously, the wrong parameters prevent the system
                    from posting correctly.

                    for detecting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on the
                    platform. Originally announced in August 2021, the project
                    had been controversial since its inception. Apple first
                    paused it that September in response to concerns from
                    digital rights groups and researchers that such a tool would
                    inevitably be abused and exploited to compromise the privacy
                    and security of all iCloud users. This week, a new child
                    safety group known as Heat Initiative told Apple that it is
                    organizing a campaign to demand that the company "detect,
                    report, and remove" child sexual abuse material from iCloud
                    and offer more tools for users to report CSAM to the
                    company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today, in a rare move, Apple responded to Heat Initiative,
                    outlining its reasons for abandoning the development of its
                    iCloud CSAM scanning feature and instead focusing on a
                    <a

                    >
                    to develop an iCloud CSAM scanning feature. Gardner said in
                    an email to CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday, which Apple also
                    shared with WIRED, that Heat Initiative found Apple's
                    decision to kill the feature "disappointing."<br />[...]<br />Apple
                    maintains that, ultimately, even its own well-intentioned
                    design could not be adequately safeguarded in practice, and
                    that on-device nudity detections for features like Messages,
                    FaceTime, AirDrop, the Photo picker are a safer
                    alternatives. Apple has also begun offering an application
                    programming interface (API) for its Communication Safety
                    features so third-party developers can incorporate them into
                    their apps. Apple says that the communication platform
                    Discord is integrating the features and that app makers
                    broadly have been enthusiastic about adopting them.

                    Rand emphasizes that the study results occupy a middle
                    ground; microtargeting is probably not the seemingly
                    overpowering force that people fear it to be, but targeted
                    political ads still have an advantage much of the time.

                    "In terms of the implications for political advertising, it
                    certainly seems like targeting is often going to be a good
                    idea, and if you're not doing that, you may be leaving
                    persuasive power on the table," Rand says. "At the same
                    time, it's clearly not mind control."

                    In that context, it makes total sense to think about how to

                    place the software, security, and user education it takes to
                    protect your business environments. The cost of device
                    management is relatively negligible compared to the

                    These findings were based upon oxygen isotopes (the same

                    conditions cause the evaporation of lighter <sup>16</sup>O,
                    leaving the water enriched in heavier <sup>18</sup>O which
                    is then incorporated into the shells of organisms living in

                    [...] Through this work, the research team identified nine
                    glacial termination events, with the three marked by an
                    asterisk representing partial termination, while the
                    remainder are fully changing from glacial to interglacial
                    conditions. The precession cycles are noticeably different
                    between the glacial terminations, which Hobart and
                    colleagues suggest may be explained by the competing
                    influence of obliquity, as well as variable ice sheet size
                    at the beginning of each cycle. Therefore, they calculate
                    the duration between the cycles ranging from 90,400 and
                    115,500 years, with the more distinct changes in precession
                    a clear indicator of the sensitivity of Late Pleistocene ice
                    sheets.

                    continually track other objects in geosynchronous orbit, a
                    capability that military leaders have prioritized over the
                    last decade. In that time, Pentagon officials say there has
                    been an escalation in "cat and mouse" games between US
                    satellites and those operated by China and Russia.

                    The US military already has its own satellites capable of

                    "There are several critical issues with current evaluation
                    techniques for large language models," says Natalie Shapira,
                    a computer scientist at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan,
                    Israel. "It creates the illusion that they have greater
                    capabilities than what truly exists."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's why a growing number of researchers—computer
                    scientists, cognitive scientists, neuroscientists,
                    linguists—want to overhaul the way they are assessed,
                    calling for more rigorous and exhaustive evaluation. Some
                    think that the practice of scoring machines on human tests
                    is wrongheaded, period, and should be ditched.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "People have been giving human intelligence tests—IQ tests
                    and so on—to machines since the very beginning of AI," says
                    Melanie Mitchell, an artificial-intelligence researcher at
                    the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. "The issue throughout
                    has been what it means when you test a machine like this. It
                    doesn't mean the same thing that it means for a human."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "There is a long history of developing methods to test
                    the human mind," says Laura Weidinger, a senior research
                    scientist at Google DeepMind. "With large language models
                    producing text that seems so human-like, it is tempting to
                    assume that human psychology tests will be useful for
                    evaluating them. But that's not true: human psychology tests
                    rely on many assumptions that may not hold for large
                    language models."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Webb is aware of the issues he waded into. "I share the
                    sense that these are difficult questions," he says. He notes
                    that despite scoring better than undergrads on certain
                    tests, GPT-3 produced absurd results on others. For example,
                    it failed a version of an analogical reasoning test about
                    physical objects that developmental psychologists sometimes
                    give to kids.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A lot of these tests—questions and answers—are online,
                    says Webb: "Many of them are almost certainly in GPT-3's and
                    GPT-4's training data, so I think we really can't conclude
                    much of anything."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The performance of large language models is brittle.
                    Among people, it is safe to assume that someone who scores
                    well on a test would also do well on a similar test. That's
                    not the case with large language models: a small tweak to a
                    test can drop an A grade to an F.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In general, AI evaluation has not been done in such a way
                    as to allow us to actually understand what capabilities
                    these models have," says Lucy Cheke, a psychologist at the
                    University of Cambridge, UK. "It's perfectly reasonable to
                    test how well a system does at a particular task, but it's
                    not useful to take that task and make claims about general
                    abilities."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The assumption that cognitive or academic tests
                    designed for humans serve as accurate measures of LLM
                    capability stems from a tendency to anthropomorphize models
                    and align their evaluation with human standards," says
                    Shapira. "This assumption is misguided."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The trouble is that nobody knows exactly how large
                    language models work. Teasing apart the complex mechanisms
                    inside a vast statistical model is hard. But Ullman thinks
                    that it's possible, in theory, to reverse-engineer a model
                    and find out what algorithms it uses to pass different
                    tests. "I could more easily see myself being convinced if
                    someone developed a technique for figuring out what these
                    things have actually learned," he says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I think that the fundamental problem is that we keep
                    focusing on test results rather than how you pass the
                    tests."

                    Shooter video game Call Of Duty has started using AI to
                    listen out for hate speech during online matches.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Publisher Activision said the moderation tool, which uses
                    machine learning technology, would be able to identify
                    discriminatory language and harassment in real time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Machine learning is what allows AI to learn and adapt on the
                    fly without explicit human instruction, instead using
                    algorithms and the data it's taught with to recognise
                    patterns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The tool being rolled out in Call Of Duty, called ToxMod, is
                    made by a company called Modulate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Activision's chief technology officer Michael Vance said it
                    would help make the game "a fun, fair and welcoming
                    experience for all players".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Activision said its existing tools, including the
                    ability for gamers to report others and the automatic
                    monitoring of text chat and offensive usernames, had already
                    seen one million accounts given communications restrictions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Call Of Duty's code of conduct bans bullying and harassment,
                    including insults based on race, sexual orientation, gender
                    identity, age, culture, faith, and country of origin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mr Vance said ToxMod allows the company's moderation efforts
                    to be scaled up significantly by categorising toxic

                    high-performance compute GPUs to the Middle East and some
                    other countries, the company said in a regulatory filing
                    this week. One of the reasons why the Biden administration
                    decided to require an export license on Nvidia's A100 and
                    H100 products and servers on their base is to thwart China's

                    government informed us of an additional licensing
                    requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined

                  <p>
                    The affected chips, namely the H100 and A100 models, are
                    already restricted for sale in China and Russia, which is
                    why Nvidia has developed H800 and A800 models with reduced
                    performance to sell in China. Although Nvidia disclosed
                    these new limitations in a U.S. regulatory filing, the
                    company did not reveal which countries in the Middle East
                    are specifically impacted by these controls.

                    Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been strengthening their
                    AI prowess in the recent years, which is why they
                    are significant purchasers of Nvidia's chips. Saudi Arabia
                    and the UAE have been in talks with China to deepen their
                    collaborations. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia even entered into
                    a strategic alliance with China, committing to work
                    collaboratively on artificial intelligence projects.

                    [...] If this letter is indeed about E-meters, the only
                    electronic device Scientology is readily connected to, then
                    Author Services may be concerned about how the Church of
                    Scientology's reputation could be impacted if E-Meters are
                    dissected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "My hunch is that the Scientologists think granting the
                    hacking community permission to dig into their E-Meter
                    software will expose the whole operation as snake oil. The
                    request is like so many other anti-Right to Repair
                    arguments: Manufacturers are afraid that access to repair
                    materials will expose some of their other dirty secrets,"
                    Chamberlain said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nathan Proctor, US Public Interest Research Group's senior
                    director, told 404 Media that Author Services' requested
                    DMCA changes would prevent people from repairing products
                    with end-user license agreements (EULAs). E-Meters have
                    EULAs, 404 Media reported, that block ordinary people from
                    getting into critical software and require an International
                    Association of Scientologists membership number to update
                    E-meter software.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Regardless of how an organization representing the works of
                    the creator of Scientology ended up in the Copyright
                    Office's mailbox, right-to-repair advocates say the
                    amendment would harm the movement and would extend past
                    electropsychometers if it were ever implemented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Obviously, very few people own E-Meters and even fewer
                    people want to repair them. But the amendment they're
                    proposing could undermine repair rights for many other
                    devices," Chamberlain said.

                    Desantis included AI-generated images in

                    company updated its policy to prohibit usage aimed at
                    mass-producing messaging for particular demographics. A
                    recent <em>Washington Post</em> article

                    Kim Malfacini, head of product policy at OpenAI, says the
                    company is exploring how its text-generation technology is
                    being used for political ends. People are not yet used to
                    assuming that content they see may be AI-generated, she
                    says. "It's likely that the use of AI tools across any
                    number of industries will only grow, and society will update
                    to that," Malfacini says. "But at the moment I think folks
                    are still in the process of updating."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since a host of similar AI tools are now widely available,

                    get wise to the use of AI in politics sooner rather than
                    later.

                    Scientists say the woman most likely caught the roundworm
                    after collecting a type of native grass, Warrigal greens,
                    beside a lake near where she lived. The area is also
                    inhabited by carpet pythons.

                    Writing in the journal, Australian parasitology expert
                    Mehrab Hossain said she suspected the woman became an
                    "accidental host" after using the foraged plants -
                    contaminated by python faeces and parasite eggs - for
                    cooking.

                    medicine at the Australian National University (ANU) - told
                    the BBC the case is a warning.

                    The ANU team reports that 30 new types of infections have
                    appeared in the last 30 years. Three-quarters are zoonotic -
                    infectious diseases that have jumped from animals to humans.

                    "It just shows as a human population burgeons, we move
                    closer and encroach on animal habitats. This is an issue we
                    see again and again, whether it's Nipah virus that's gone
                    from wild bats to domestic pigs and then into people,
                    whether it's a coronavirus like Sars or Mers that has jumped
                    from bats into possibly a secondary animal and then into
                    humans."

                    While this might sound like science fiction, the federal
                    government has already embraced the technology. In May, the

                    for laboratory services to assist with "autonomously
                    collected eDNA testing": environmental DNA testing based on
                    samples that are no longer even manually collected.

                    [...] "A universal database really just would subvert our
                    ideas of autonomy and freedom and the presumption of

                    government to track us at any time based on our private
                    information," Eidelman told The Intercept, adding that DNA
                    collection presents specific risks to privacy. "Our DNA is
                    personal and sensitive: It can expose our propensity for

                    the department from collection requirements for non-U.S.

                    [...] For this study, they worked with three groups of
                    adults in their 20s with different drinking patterns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The groups were: light drinkers who do not binge-drink;
                    heavy social drinkers who binge-drink several times a month
                    (defined as consuming five or more drinks for a man or four
                    or more for a woman); and drinkers who meet the criteria for
                    alcohol use disorder and binge-drink 11 or more days in a
                    typical month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They had each group consume a set amount of alcohol and
                    tested their performance on both a fine motor task and a
                    paper-and-pencil cognitive skill test.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When given a standard intoxicating dose, which produce
                    breathalyzer readings of 0.08%, the light drinkers were more
                    impaired than the heavier drinkers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yet when those drinkers with alcohol use disorder consumed a
                    higher amount, akin to their usual drinking habits, they
                    showed significant impairment on those same tasks—more than
                    double their impairment at the standard intoxicating dose.
                    They did not return to baseline performance for at least
                    three hours after drinking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their level of impairment even exceeded that of the light
                    drinkers who consumed the standard dose, suggesting that the
                    physical effects of the alcohol add up the more someone
                    drinks, experienced or not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I was surprised at how much impairment that group had to
                    that larger dose, because while it's 50% more than the first
                    dose, we're seeing more than double the impairment," King
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "It's costly to our society for so many reasons,
                    that's why this study is just so important to understand
                    more," she said. "I'm hoping we can educate people who are
                    experienced high-intensity drinkers who think that they're
                    holding their liquor or that they're tolerant and won't
                    experience accidents or injury from drinking. Their
                    experience with alcohol only goes so far, and excessive
                    drinkers account for most of the burden of alcohol-related
                    accidents and injury in society. This is preventable with
                    education and treatment."

                    The new policy says that X "may collect and use your
                    personal information (such as your employment history,
                    educational history, employment preferences, skills and

                    recommend potential jobs for you, to share with potential
                    employers when you apply for a job, to enable employers to
                    find potential candidates, and to show you more relevant

                    The biometric data and employment history disclosures are
                    listed in the section, "information you provide us." The
                    policy does not say what kind of biometric data X would
                    collect. We contacted X about the changes and will update
                    this article if we get a response.

                reports on a find that could up-end much of what we believe on
                the origin of humans.

                    Africa has always been considered the cradle of mankind,
                    where humans evolved from apes on the continent before
                    spreading to the rest of the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An intriguing find is challenging the long-standing
                    assumption.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The partial skull of a new ancient ape has been discovered
                    in Turkey, and it appears to predate African apes,
                    suggesting that human origins may actually lie in Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fossil of Anadoluvius turkae was discovered in Cankiri,
                    a city about 138 kilometres north-east of Ankara, and is
                    thought to date from about 8.7 million years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In contrast, early hominins – the group that includes
                    chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, humans, and their fossil
                    ancestors – were not seen in Africa until about 7 million
                    years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It suggests that the ancestors of African apes and humans
                    evolved in Europe before migrating south between 9 million
                    and 7 million years ago.

                    Microsoft will start unbundling Teams from its Microsoft 365

                    [...] Alongside the Teams unbundling, Microsoft is also

                    Slack to integrate into Exchange, Outlook, and Teams.
                    Microsoft will also allow rivals to host Office web
                    applications within their competing apps, just like how
                    Microsoft does in Teams.

                    Microsoft will now have to wait on EU regulators to decide
                    whether its unbundling of Teams from Office suites in EU
                    markets is enough. “We believe these changes balance the
                    interests of our competitors with those of European business
                    customers, providing them with access to the best possible
                    solutions at competitive prices,” says Linde. “We also
                    recognize that we are still in the early stages of the
                    European Commission’s formal investigation. We will continue
                    to engage with the Commission, listen to concerns in the
                    marketplace, and remain open to exploring pragmatic
                    solutions that benefit both customers and developers in
                    Europe.”

                    not as inhospitable as previously believed.

                    The south pole is of great interest to space agencies racing
                    to get to the lunar surface, with plans to build a permanent
                    lunar habitat and establish a sustainable human presence on
                    the Moon. Previous evidence suggests that the lunar south
                    pole has reservoirs of ice water in its permanently shadowed
                    regions, which could be used for drinking water or fuel.

                    [...] IBM spokesman Imtiaz Mufti denied that its work on the
                    contract was in conflict with its 2020 commitments. “IBM no
                    longer offers general-purpose facial recognition and,
                    consistent with our 2020 commitment, does not support the
                    use of facial recognition for mass surveillance, racial
                    profiling, or other human rights violations,” he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The Home Office Biometrics Matcher Platform and associated
                    Services contract is not used in mass surveillance. It
                    supports police and immigration services in identifying
                    suspects against a database of fingerprint and photo data.
                    It is not capable of video ingest, which would typically be
                    needed to support face-in-a-crowd biometric usage.”

                    Human rights campaigners, however, said IBM’s work on the
                    project is incompatible with its 2020 commitments. Kojo
                    Kyerewaa of Black Lives Matter UK said: “IBM has shown
                    itself willing to step over the body and memory of George
                    Floyd to chase a Home Office contract. This won’t be
                    forgotten.”

                    we've shown this is possible for the first time, we're
                    looking forward to trying to understand whether it's really
                    true that where there's smoke, there's fire. Maybe we'll
                    even be able to find galaxies that are so young that complex
                    molecules like these haven't had time to form in the vacuum
                    of space yet, so galaxies are all fire and no smoke. The
                    only way to know for sure is to look at more galaxies,
                    hopefully even further away than this one."

                    Currently, two of the biggest industry drivers of metaverse
                    development are Meta (formerly Facebook, which believed in
                    the technology so much it rebranded itself) and Microsoft,
                    both of which contributed to the study. Meta has been
                    focusing on individual experiences, such as gaming, while
                    Microsoft specializes in business solutions, including
                    remote conferencing and distance learning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These findings could help policymakers understand how
                    metaverse industry growth can accelerate progress towards
                    achieving net-zero emissions targets and spur more flexible
                    decarbonization strategies. Metaverse-based remote working,
                    distance learning and virtual tourism could be promoted to
                    improve air quality. In addition to alleviating air
                    pollutant emissions, the reduction of transportation and
                    commercial energy usage could help transform the way energy
                    is distributed, with more energy supply going towards the
                    residential sector.

                    On I Love Lucy, whenever Lucy or Ricky Ricardo gave out
                    their phone number, they'd say it as "Murray Hill 5-9975."
                    Even though that may look and sound like gibberish to modern
                    phone-users, it was perfectly normal at the time. Lucy, you
                    got some 'splaining to do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Phone numbers looked like this in the middle of the 20th
                    century because of telephone exchanges—the hubs through
                    which an area's calls would be routed. Phone subscribers
                    were given a unique five-digit number within their service
                    area. These would be preceded by two digits, which were
                    identified by letters, that denoted the telephone exchange
                    you were connected to. (Before the 1950s, some cities used
                    three letters and four numbers, while others had two letters
                    and three numbers. The two letter, five number format—or
                    "2L-5N"—was eventually standardized throughout the country).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because these telephone exchanges could only facilitate
                    around 10,000 subscribers, many large cities had multiple
                    hubs. The Ricardo's MUrray Hill5-9975 meant their number was
                    685-9975 ("Hill" and its capital H served purely as a
                    mnemonic), with the 68, or "MU," representing the east side
                    of Manhattan's telephone exchange. This is also why phones
                    still have letters over the numbers (three over 2 through 8,
                    and four over 9).

                    A high ratio of cesium-135 to cesium-137 is a telltale sign
                    that the isotopes came from nuclear weapons rather than
                    nuclear reactors. Radioactive cesium-135 is created when
                    xenon-135, a product of the nuclear fission of uranium,
                    decays without absorbing a neutron. In nuclear reactors, the
                    level of xenon-135 is controlled and converted to its stable
                    form of xenon-136 through neutron absorption. In the case of
                    nuclear weapons, however, xenon-135 is left to proliferate,
                    and it leads to higher levels of radioactive cesium-135.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers calculated that between 10 and 68
                    percent of the cesium contamination in the wild boar samples
                    are from nuclear weapons testing. "Although Chernobyl has
                    been widely believed to be the prime source of [cesium-137]
                    in wild boars, we find that 'old' [cesium-137] from weapons
                    fallout significantly contributes to the total level in
                    those specimens that exceeded the regulatory limit," they
                    wrote. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, the team is warning against the detrimental long
                    lasting effects of nuclear weapons and nuclear reactor
                    disasters on food safety. Countries like the US, Soviet
                    Union, and UK conducted thousands of nuclear weapons tests
                    during the Cold War from the 1940s to 1990s. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "An important takeaway is that the long-forgotten
                    atmospheric nuclear weapons tests and their fallout still
                    cast a shadow on the environment," Steinhauser told us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Just because they took place 60 years ago doesn't mean that
                    they no longer impact the ecosystem. Monitoring of wild
                    boars will remain necessary (then there is no problem eating
                    them). We must take good care of our planet and avoid any
                    further releases. These may create a snowball effect."

                    If you fancy creating a blog or website to discuss the Arm
                    architecture or the Softbank-owned outfit that develops it,
                    keep the British CPU designer's name out of the domain name
                    you choose – or draw the wrath of its lawyers.

                    [...] Strictly speaking, the letter went to the web host
                    provider for her Arm-related websites, who passed it onto
                    Markstedter to handle. The missive demanded that the website
                    come down as it featured Arm's "Arm" trademark in the domain
                    name.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Arm's rush to snatch up domain names is somewhat
                    ironic, considering that in 2018 the biz create the website
                    riscv-basics.com and used it to host content smearing rival
                    RISC-V architecture and list multiple reasons why Arm's tech
                    is superior. Arm pulled the dot-com after an internal revolt
                    by its staff, and the domain has since lapsed into someone
                    else's hands.

                  <p>
                    Arm's takedown comes just a week after the Neoverse designer
                    officially filed for an IPO on the US Nasdaq. In the filing,
                    Arm disclosed numerous risk factors, including many related
                    to its operations in China. However, we don't recall any
                    mention of experts writing tutorials about its ISA as
                    something Arm thinks investors need to worry about.

                    Until now, the hard-shelled egg was thought to be the key to
                    the success of the amniotes - a group of vertebrates that
                    undergo embryonic or foetal development within an amnion, a
                    protective membrane inside the egg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, a fresh study of 51 fossil species and 29 living
                    species which could be categorised as oviparous (laying hard
                    or soft-shelled eggs) or viviparous (giving birth to live
                    young) suggests otherwise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings, published today in Nature Ecology &amp;
                    Evolution, show that all the great evolutionary branches of
                    Amniota, namely Mammalia, Lepidosauria (lizards and
                    relatives), and Archosauria (dinosaurs, crocodilians, birds)
                    reveal viviparity and extended embryo retention in their
                    ancestors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Extended embryo retention (EER) is when the young are
                    retained by the mother for a varying amount of time, likely
                    depending on when conditions are best for survival.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the hard-shelled egg has often been seen as one of the
                    greatest innovations in evolution, this research implies it
                    was EER that gave this particular group of animals the
                    ultimate protection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "EER is common and variable in lizards and snakes
                    today. Their young can be released, either inside an egg or
                    as little wrigglers, at different developmental stages, and
                    there appears to be ecological advantages of EER, perhaps
                    allowing the mothers to release their young when
                    temperatures are warm enough and food supplies are rich."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Professor Benton concluded: "Our work, and that of many
                    others in recent years, has consigned the classic 'reptile
                    egg' model of the textbooks to the wastebasket.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The first amniotes had evolved extended embryo retention
                    rather than a hard-shelled egg to protect the developing
                    embryo for a lesser or greater amount of time inside the
                    mother, so birth could be delayed until environments become
                    favourable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Whether the first amniote babies were born in parchment
                    eggs or as live, snapping little insect-eaters is unknown,
                    but this adaptive parental protection gave them the
                    advantage over spawning earlier tetrapods."

                    [...] One unproven theory is that day length might have
                    stalled at a constant value in Earth's distant past. In
                    addition to tides in the ocean related to the pull of the
                    Moon, Earth also has solar tides related to the atmosphere
                    heating up during daytime.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Solar atmospheric tides are not as strong as lunar oceanic
                    tides, but this would not always have been the case. When
                    Earth was rotating faster in the past, the tug of the Moon
                    would have been much weaker. Unlike the pull of the Moon,
                    the Sun's tide instead pushes Earth. So while the Moon slows
                    Earth's rotation down, the Sun speeds it up.

                  <p>
                    "Because of this, if in the past these two opposite forces
                    were to have become been equal to each other, such a tidal
                    resonance would have caused Earth's day length to stop
                    changing and to have remained constant for some time," said
                    Kirscher.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And that's exactly what the new data compilation showed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Earth's day length appears to have stopped its long-term
                    increase and flatlined at about 19 hours roughly between two
                    to one billion years ago—"the billion years," Mitchell
                    noted, "commonly referred to as the 'boring' billion."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The timing of the stalling intriguingly lies between the two
                    largest rises in oxygen. Timothy Lyons of the University
                    California, Riverside, who was not involved in the study,
                    said, "It's fascinating to think that the evolution of the
                    Earth's rotation could have affected the evolving
                    composition of the atmosphere."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new study thus supports the idea that Earth's rise to
                    modern oxygen levels had to wait for longer days for
                    photosynthetic bacteria to generate more oxygen each day.

                    Instead, the researchers behind the new study suggests a new
                    theory of how Earth was created.

                    "There was a disk around the young Sun where the planets
                    were growing. The disk was filled with small dust particles.
                    Once a planet reaches a certain size, it sorts of act like a
                    vacuum cleaner, sucking up all that dust very quickly. And
                    that makes it grow to the size of Earth in just a few
                    million years," says Ph.D. student Isaac Onyett, who is the
                    corresponding author of the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This vacuuming of small dust particles not only played a
                    vital role in Earth's formation but made sure that water was
                    delivered to our planet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The disk also contains many icy particles. As the vacuum
                    cleaner effect draws in the dust, it also captures a portion
                    of the ice. This process contributes to the presence of
                    water during Earth's formation, rather than relying on a
                    chance event delivering water 100 million years later," says
                    Isaac Onyett.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With the new knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms
                    there is a much greater chance of water being present on
                    other planets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This theory would predict that whenever you form a planet
                    like Earth, you will have water on it. If you go to another
                    planetary system where there is a planet orbiting a star the
                    size of the Sun, then the planet should have water if it is
                    in the right distance," says Martin Bizzarro.

                    The International Gemini Observatory, a key player in global
                    astronomical research, has temporarily halted astronomical
                    operations following a cyberattack. The culprits and their
                    motives remain unknown.
                  </p>

                    The computer hack, which took place on the morning of August
                    1, led to the suspension of the Gemini North and South
                    Telescopes, as detailed in an August 24 statement from the
                    National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory
                    (NOIRLab). While the North telescope is situated in Hawaii,
                    its southern counterpart is located on Cerro Pachón, Chili,
                    with a few other smaller telescopes located in Cerro Tololo,
                    also in Chile. Observatories stationed on Arizona’s Kitt
                    Peak, however, remain unaffected by the intrusion, according
                    to NOIRLab.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “Like the entire astronomy community, we are
                    disappointed that some of our telescopes are not currently
                    observing. Fortunately, we have been able to keep some
                    telescopes online and collect data with in-person
                    workarounds,” NOIRLab stated in its release. “We are
                    grateful for the support of the astronomy community during
                    this difficult time and we thank everyone for their patience
                    as our teams continue to work towards restoring normal
                    operations.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For the time being, Gemini North has been securely
                    positioned in its zenith-pointing orientation. NOIRLab
                    credits the prompt actions of its security team for
                    preventing any damage to the observatory. As to who is
                    responsible for the hacks, or their motivations, that
                    remains either unknown or undisclosed. NOIRLab has been
                    tight-lipped about the incident, claiming that it is
                    “limited” in what it can share about its “cybersecurity
                    controls and investigatory findings.”

                    develop new drugs that decouple the parasite's clock from
                    that of its host, and thereby help the immune system better
                    fight the invaders.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    I recently bought an LG ULTRAGEAR monitor secondhand off of
                    a coworker. I really love it and it's been great so far, but
                    I ran into some minor issues with it in Linux. It works
                    great on both Mac and Windows, but on Linux it displays just
                    a black panel until I use the second monitor to go in and
                    reduce the refresh rate down to 60 Hz.
                  </p>
                  <p>This has worked decent so far but there's some issues:</p>
                  <p>
                    It doesn't work while linux is booting up. The motherboards
                    boot sequence is visible just fine, but as soon as control
                    is handed over to Linux and I'd normally see a splash screen
                    while I'm waiting for my login window, I see nothing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It doesn't work on the login screen. This would be fine if
                    login consistently worked on my second screen, but I need to
                    manually switch the cables between my work computer and the
                    desktop for the second screen and sometimes I don't feel
                    like doing that. Even when I switch the cables, the second
                    screen seems to be moody and doesn't always show the login
                    screen either.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once I've logged in and fixed the settings on my second
                    screen it seems to go fine, unless I actually unplug the
                    second screen. If I do, it looks like the graphics settings
                    go reset back to default (settings that don't work) and I
                    lose the main monitor too.
                  </p>

                    washing products tested, including harsh chemical substances
                    and milder solutions. Norovirus - known as the winter
                    vomiting bug - was the most resilient.

                    with bleach are more effective in preventing the spread of
                    the norovirus infection and more research needs to be done
                    to see whether heavily diluted bleach-based hand washes,
