                    revealed a significant financial loss suffered by a
                    multinational company's Hong Kong office, amounting to
                    HK$200 million (US$25.6 million), due to a sophisticated
                    scam involving deepfake technology. The scam featured a
                    digitally recreated version of the company's chief financial
                    officer, along with other employees, who appeared in a video
                    conference call instructing an employee to transfer funds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due to an ongoing investigation, Hong Kong police did not
                    release details of which company was scammed.

                  <p>
                    [...] The scam was initially uncovered following a phishing
                    attempt, when an employee in the finance department of the
                    company's Hong Kong branch received what seemed to be a
                    phishing message, purportedly from the company's UK-based
                    chief financial officer, instructing them to execute a
                    secret transaction. Despite initial doubts, the employee was
                    convinced by the presence of the CFO and others in a group
                    video call and proceeded to make 15 transfers totaling
                    HK$200 million to five different Hong Kong bank accounts.
                    The realization of the scam occurred approximately a week
                    later, prompting a police investigation.
                  </p>

                    [...] Acting senior superintendent Baron Chan Shun-ching of
                    the Hong Kong police emphasized the novelty of this scam,
                    noting that it was the first instance in Hong Kong where
                    victims were deceived in a multi-person video conference
                    setting. He pointed out the scammer's strategy of not
                    engaging directly with the victim beyond requesting a
                    self-introduction, which made the scam more convincing.

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>The myth...</p>
                  <p>
                    When thinking about data backup, many people have tended to
                    fixate on the possibility of a crashed hard disk, and in
                    modern times, a totally dead SSD. It's been the classic
                    disaster scenario for decades, assuming that your office
                    doesn't burn down overnight. You sit down in front of your
                    desktop in the morning, and it won't boot. As you reach in
                    to fiddle with SATA cables and clean connections, you
                    realise that the disk isn't even spinning up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Maybe you knew enough to try a couple of short, sharp,
                    ninety degree twists in the plane of the platters, in case
                    it was caused by stiction. But sooner or later, reality
                    dawns, and it becomes clear that the disk will never spin
                    again. It, along with your data, is gone forever. So a
                    couple of full back-ups at regular intervals should suffice,
                    right?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Except that isn't how it usually happens - most likely
                    you'll be calling on your backups for some other reason.
                  </p>
                  <p>The reality...</p>
                  <p>
                    Aside from the fact that when modern SSDs fail they often
                    remain readable, I.E. they become read-only, your data is
                    much more likely to be at risk from silent corruption over
                    time or overwritten due to operator error.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Silent corruption can happen for reasons ranging from bad
                    SATA cables and buggy SSD firmware, to malware and more.
                    Operator error might go genuinely un-noticed, or be covered
                    up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Both of these scenarios can be protected against with an
                    adequate backup strategy, but the simple approach of a
                    regular, full backup, (which also often goes untested), in
                    many cases just won't suffice.
                  </p>
                </div>

              <p>
                Aspects like the time interval between backups, how many copies
                to have and how long to keep them, speed of recovery, and the
                confidentiality and integrity of said backups are all addressed.
                Also covered are silent corruption, archiving unchanging data,
                examples of comprehensive backup plans, and how to correctly
                store, label, and handle the backup storage media.

                We have occasionally picked out specific piece of Linux software
                that we think might be of interest to some in our community. For
                example, TAILS gets an occasional mention, and we frequently
                discuss 'improvements' to web browser that are supposed to make
                our lives better in some way. This one is slightly different. It
                is, as far as I can recall, the first time that we have received
                a submission for a Windows Boot Disk.
              </p>

                    - Hiren's BootCD PE core has been updated to Windows 11 Pro
                    v10.0.22621.2428 (build 22621).<br />- 340 new drivers have
                    been integrated into the Windows 11 PE image in the IO,
                    Network and Storage categories.<br />- Almost all utilities
                    have been updated.<br />- Most of the known bugs have been
                    fixed."

                    "Hiren's BootCD PE (Preinstallation Environment) is a
                    restored edition of Hiren's BootCD based on Windows 11 PE
                    x64. Given the absence of official updates after November
                    2012, the PE version is currently under development by the
                    fans of Hiren's BootCD. It features a curated selection of
                    the best free tools while being tailored for new-age
                    computers, supporting UEFI booting and requiring a minimum
                    of 4 GB RAM.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Equipped with these invaluable tools, you can address
                    various computer-related problems. Notably, it does not
                    include any pirated software; instead, it exclusively
                    contains free and legal software.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If your computer does not support a regular Windows 11
                    installation, it will likely boot with the Windows 11 PE
                    version, as Windows PE versions have significantly lower
                    hardware requirements. For instance, if your computer boots
                    with the Windows 10 PE version, it is highly probable that
                    it will also boot with the Windows 11 PE version.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Upon booting, the PE version attempts to install drivers for
                    essential components such as graphics, sound, wireless and
                    Ethernet cards for your hardware, facilitating connection to
                    a WIFI or Ethernet network. If your WIFI or Ethernet card is
                    not recognized by the PE version, kindly Contact Us with
                    your hardware model. We will strive to incorporate the
                    necessary drivers in upcoming releases.

                    said taking a plea deal on just two charges saved him the
                    time and money of fighting all 14 charges made against him
                    in court.

                    [...] Now that he's free, Bowser says he has been relying on
                    friends and a GoFundMe[<a

                    >] page to pay for rent and necessities as he looks for a
                    job. That search could be somewhat hampered by his criminal
                    record and by terms of the plea deal that prevent him from
                    working with any modern gaming hardware.

                  <p>
                    Despite this, Bowser told The Guardian that his current
                    circumstances are still preferable to a period of
                    homelessness he experienced during his 20s. And while
                    console hacking might be out for Bowser, he is reportedly
                    still "tinkering away with old-school Texas Instruments
                    calculators" to pass the time.

                    or furthering an act of terrorism. He is currently being

                    Facebook (now Meta) has become an avatar of all that is
                    wrong with Silicon Valley. Its self-interested role in
                    spreading global disinformation is an ongoing crisis.
                    Recall, too, the company’s secret mood-manipulation
                    experiment in 2012, which deliberately tinkered with what
                    users saw in their News Feed in order to measure how
                    Facebook could influence people’s emotional states without
                    their knowledge. Or its participation in inciting genocide
                    in Myanmar in 2017. Or its use as a clubhouse for planning
                    and executing the January 6, 2021, insurrection. (In
                    Facebook’s early days, Zuckerberg listed “revolutions” among
                    his interests. This was around the time that he had a
                    business card printed with I’M CEO, BITCH.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And yet, to a remarkable degree, Facebook’s way of doing
                    business remains the norm for the tech industry as a whole,
                    even as other social platforms (TikTok) and technological
                    developments (artificial intelligence) eclipse Facebook in
                    cultural relevance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new technocrats claim to embrace Enlightenment values,
                    but in fact they are leading an antidemocratic, illiberal
                    movement.

                    [...] The Shakespearean drama that unfolded late last year
                    at OpenAI underscores the extent to which the worst of
                    Facebook’s “move fast and break things” mentality has been
                    internalized and celebrated in Silicon Valley. OpenAI was
                    founded, in 2015, as a nonprofit dedicated to bringing

                    that closing the lid before flushing could substantially

                      >in 2019</a

                    bioaerosol sensors in a shared lavatory for a week to
                    monitor the number and size of contaminant particles. They
                    concluded that flushing with the toilet lid down reduced
                    airborne droplets between 30 and 60 percent. But this
                    scenario also increased the diameter of the droplets and
                    bacteria concentration. Leaving the lid down also means the
                    airborne microdroplets are still detectable 16 minutes after
                    flushing, 11 minutes longer than if one flushed with the lid
                    up.

                    [...] Perhaps the least surprising finding is that rigorous
                    cleaning with a toilet bowl brush and Lysol reduced the
                    contamination by 99.99 percent compared to cleaning with
                    just a brush. Therefore, "The most effective strategy for
                    reducing restroom cross-contamination associated with toilet
                    flushing include the addition of a disinfectant to the
                    toilet bowl before flushing and the use of
                    disinfectant/detergent dispensers in the toilet tank," the
                    authors concluded. They also recommend regularly
                    disinfecting all restroom surfaces after flushing or
                    cleaning with a toilet brush in health care facilities—which
                    often have a lot of immunocompromised people—and if someone
                    in your house has an active infection like norovirus.

                    That tape over your webcam may not be enough. Researchers at
                    the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have
                    highlighted imaging privacy threats enabled by ambient light
                    sensors, in a paper recently published in

                    use. However, researchers have shown visual information can
                    be gathered via one of the common ambient light sensors
                    installed in many devices. These small sensors usually
                    aren’t shuttered or disabled by users and are typically
                    permission-free on a device level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ambient light sensors are categorized as low-risk by device
                    makers and can often be accessed directly by software (or
                    malware) without any permissions or privileges.
                    Nevertheless, previous studies have shown such a rudimentary
                    sensor can provide enough information to infer keystrokes on
                    a virtual keyboard and
                    <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2666620.2666622"
                      >steal a device PIN</a
                    >, about 80% of the time. The new research shows what an
                    ambient light sensor can do when combined with an active
                    light source component – namely the device' screen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For their experiments, the MIT researchers used a Samsung
                    Galaxy View 2. This rather old and large (17.3-inch)
                    consumer tablet has its ambient light sensor next to the
                    front-facing (selfie) camera, which is still a very common
                    configuration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The scientists explained that the ambient light sensor
                    reads the light emitted by the screen shining on a person’s
                    face and being partially blocked by the hand / screen
                    interaction. A whole lot of complicated math, aided by AI
                    and image processing technology, was used by the researchers
                    to deliver their results.

                    Launching rockets into space with atomic bombs is a crazy
                    idea that was thankfully discarded many decades ago. But as
                    Richard Corfield discovers, the potential of using the
                    energy from nuclear-powered engines to drive space travel is
                    back on NASA’s agenda
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1914 H G Wells published The World Set Free, a novel
                    based on the notion that radium might one day power
                    spaceships. Wells, who was familiar with the work of
                    physicists such as Ernest Rutherford, knew that radium could
                    produce heat and envisaged it being used to turn a turbine.
                    The book might have been a work of fiction, but The World
                    Set Free correctly foresaw the potential of what one might
                    call “atomic spaceships”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea of using nuclear energy for space travel took hold
                    in the 1950s when the public – having witnessed the horrors
                    of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – gradually became convinced of
                    the utility of nuclear power for peaceful purposes. Thanks
                    to programmes such as America’s Atoms for Peace, people
                    began to see that nuclear power could be used for energy and
                    transport. But perhaps the most radical application lay in
                    spaceflight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among the strongest proponents of nuclear-powered space
                    travel was the eminent mathematical physicist Freeman Dyson.
                    In 1958 he took a year’s sabbatical from the Institute of
                    Advanced Study in Princeton to work at General Atomics in
                    San Diego on a project code-named Orion. The brainchild of
                    Ted Taylor – a physicist who had worked on the Manhattan
                    atomic-bomb project at Las Alamos – Project Orion aimed to
                    build a 4000-tonne spaceship that would use 2600 nuclear
                    bombs to propel it into space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Despite Project Orion ending, the lure of nuclear
                    propulsion never really went away (see box “Nuclear space
                    travel: a brief history”) and is now enjoying something of a
                    resurgence. Rather than using atomic bombs, however, the
                    idea is to transfer the energy from a nuclear fission
                    reactor to a propellant fuel, which would be heated to
                    roughly 2500 K and ejected via a nozzle in a process called
                    “nuclear thermal propulsion” (NTP). Alternatively, the
                    fission energy could ionize a gas that would be fired out of
                    the back of the spacecraft – what’s known as “nuclear
                    electric propulsion” (NEP).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, is nuclear-powered space travel a realistic prospect
                    and, if so, which technology will win out? [...] A nuclear
                    spacecraft would instead use fission energy to heat a fuel
                    (figure 1) – most likely cryogenically stored liquid
                    hydrogen, which has a low molecular mass and high heat of
                    combustion. “Nuclear propulsion, either electric or thermal,
                    could extract more energy from a given mass of fuel than is
                    possible via combustion-based propulsion,” says Dale Thomas,
                    a former associate director at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight
                    Center, now at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thomas says that today’s most efficient chemical propulsion
                    systems can achieve a specific impulse of about 465 seconds.
                    NTP, in contrast, can have a specific impulse of almost 900
                    seconds due to the higher power density of nuclear
                    reactions. Combined with a much higher thrust-to-weight
                    ratio, NTP could get a rocket to Mars in just 500 days,
                    rather than 900.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The thrust-to-weight ratio is crucial because it determines
                    the spacecraft’s ability to accelerate, which is especially
                    critical during key mission phases, like escaping Earth’s
                    gravity or manoeuvring in deep space,” says Mauro Augelli,
                    head of launch systems at the UK Space Agency. “The specific
                    impulse, on the other hand, is a measure of how effectively
                    a rocket uses its propellant.”

                        but by doing so, Red Hat makes it more difficult for
                        anyone to verify the company's GPL compliance.

                on Thursday for leaking the US spy agency's most valuable
                hacking tools to WikiLeaks:

                  <p>
                    Joshua Schulte, 35, was found guilty in 2022 of espionage
                    and other charges in what the CIA called a "digital Pearl
                    Harbor" -- the largest data breach in the history of the
                    intelligence agency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] US District Judge Jesse Furman sentenced Schulte to 40
                    years in prison for espionage, computer hacking, contempt of
                    court, making false statements to the FBI and child
                    pornography.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Schulte worked for the CIA's elite hacking unit from 2012 to
                    2016 when he quietly took cyber tools used to break into
                    computer and technology systems, according to court
                    documents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After quitting his job, he sent them to WikiLeaks, which
                    began publishing the classified data in March 2017.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The leaked data included a collection of malware,
                    viruses, trojans, and "zero day" exploits that, once leaked
                    out, were available for use by foreign intelligence groups,
                    hackers and cyber extortionists around the world, they said.

                    Congress has moved slowly, while only a few states have
                    specifically banned AI-generated non-consensual intimate

                    in 2023 that risks of realistic but fake images spreading
                    included normalizing child sexual exploitation, luring more
                    children into harm's way and making it harder for law
                    enforcement to find actual children being harmed.

                    >
                    earlier this year that an American Airlines flight
                    attendant, Estes Carter Thompson III, was arrested "for
                    allegedly surreptitiously recording or attempting to record
                    a minor female passenger using a lavatory aboard an
                    aircraft." A search of Thompson's iCloud revealed "four
                    additional instances" where Thompson allegedly recorded
                    other minors in the lavatory, as well as "over 50 images of
                    a 9-year-old unaccompanied minor" sleeping in her seat.
                    While police attempted to identify these victims, they also
                    "further alleged that hundreds of images of AI-generated
                    child pornography" were found on Thompson's phone.<br />[...]<br />The
                    NYT report noted that in 2002, the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/16/national/supreme-court-strikes-down-ban-on-virtual-child-pornography.html"

                    that had been on the books since 1996 preventing "virtual"
                    or "computer-generated child pornography." South Carolina's
                    attorney general, Alan Wilson, has said that AI technology
                    available today may test that ruling, especially if minors
                    continue to be harmed by fake AI child sex images spreading
                    online. In the meantime, federal laws such as obscenity
                    statutes may be used to prosecute cases, the NYT reported.

                    which seeks to "prohibit the non-consensual disclosure of
                    digitally altered intimate images." That was re-introduced
                    this year after

                    Francesca Mani, one of the teen victims in New Jersey, was
                    there to help announce the proposed law, which includes

                    harmful images.

                    A medical treatment given to children in the UK may have led
                    to some developing Alzheimer’s disease decades later, new
                    research out Monday suggests. The study presents evidence
                    that at least five people contracted the neurodegenerative
                    disorder from having received human growth hormones
                    contaminated with rogue amyloid beta protein. The authors
                    point out that Alzheimer’s cannot be caught person-to-person
                    through conventional means, however, and this specific
                    infection risk no longer exists today.

                    Starting in the 1950s, scientists learned how to extract
                    human growth hormone (HGH) from the pituitary glands of
                    cadavers. Unfortunately, the method only provided minute
                    amounts of hormone at a time, which limited the supply of
                    HGH available for medical and research purposes. As a
                    result, its distribution was meticulously handled, and it
                    was typically only given to treat the most severe
                    growth-related conditions in children.

                  <p>
                    This remained the status quo for the next 30 years, with
                    more than 20,000 children worldwide having received this
                    form of cadaver-derived HGH. But in the mid-1980s, health
                    officials in the U.S. and elsewhere began to get

                    a rare but universally fatal neurodegenerative disease.
                    These cases were happening in much younger people than
                    typically seen with CJD, and it was soon discovered those
                    affected shared a history of past HGH treatment. Within
                    months of this discovery, the U.S. and other countries shut
                    down their cadaver HGH programs.

                    [...] The paper details eight patients who visited the UCL’s
                    National Prion Clinic. Five of them appear to have developed
                    early onset Alzheimer’s, with a sixth having mild cognitive
                    impairment. But none of the patients seemed to have known
                    genetic mutations that cause Alzheimer’s to happen at a
                    younger age or other shared factors besides a past history
                    of HGH treatment.

                  <p>
                    Alzheimer’s is caused by the build-up of two misfolded
                    proteins in the brain, amyloid beta and tau, with amyloid
                    beta seen as the driving force of the two. The team’s past
                    research has found amyloid beta inside the brains of people
                    who died from HGH-caused Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, as well
                    as inside samples of preserved HGH. And in the lab, they’ve
                    been able to successfully cause mice to develop
                    Alzheimer’s-like illness after exposing them to these
                    contaminated samples.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Put all the pieces together, the study authors say, and it’s
                    enough to show that “Alzheimer’s disease should now be
                    recognized as a potentially transmissible disorder.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “It is important to stress that the circumstances
                    through which we believe these individuals tragically
                    developed Alzheimer’s are highly unusual, and to reinforce
                    that there is no risk that the disease can be spread between
                    individuals or in routine medical care,” said study author
                    Jonathan Schott, a UCL neurologist and chief medical officer
                    at Alzheimer’s Research UK, in a
                    <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1032454"

                    from the university. “These findings do, however, provide
                    potentially valuable insights into disease mechanisms, and
                    pave the way for further research which we hope will further
                    our understanding of the causes of more typical, late onset
                    Alzheimer’s disease.”

                    By now most internet users know their online activity is
                    constantly tracked. No one should be shocked to see ads for
                    items they previously searched for, or to be asked if their
                    data can be shared with an unknown number of "partners."

                    But what is the scale of this surveillance? Judging from
                    data collected by Facebook and newly described in a unique

                      >Consumer Reports (PDF)</a

                    Using a panel of 709 volunteers who shared archives of their
                    Facebook data, Consumer Reports found that a total of
                    186,892 companies sent data about them to the social
                    network. On average, each participant in the study had their
                    data sent to Facebook by 2,230 companies. That number varied
                    significantly, with some panelists' data listing over 7,000
                    companies providing their data. The Markup helped Consumer
                    Reports recruit participants for the study. Participants
                    downloaded an archive of the previous three years of their
                    data from their Facebook settings, then provided it to
                    Consumer Reports.

                    practices. "We offer a number of transparency tools to help
                    people understand the information that businesses choose to

                    While Meta does provide transparency tools like the one that
                    enabled the study, Consumer Reports identified problems with
                    them, including that the identity of many data providers is
                    unclear from the names disclosed to users and that companies
                    that provide services to advertisers are often allowed to

                    Sometimes, it's worth taking a moment to note the end of an
                    era, even when that ending might have happened a long time
                    ago. Today, Apple announced that it considers the mid-2012
                    13-inch MacBook Pro obsolete. It was the last MacBook Pro to
                    include an optical drive for playing CDs or DVDs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This means that any MacBook Pro with an optical drive is no
                    longer supported.<br />[...]<br />Apple stopped selling the
                    mid-2012 13-inch MacBook Pro
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/10/apple-quietly-kills-non-retina-macbook-pro-it-sold-for-four-years/"
                      >in October 2016</a
                    >
                    (it was available for a while as the company's budget option
                    in the Pro lineup), so anyone doing the math saw this
                    coming.<br />[...]<br />The exclusion of an optical drive in
                    subsequent MacBook Pro models was controversial, but it's
                    now clear that whether Apple was jumping the gun at that
                    point or not, optical drives have fallen away for most
                    users, and many Windows laptops no longer include them.<br />[...]<br />That's
                    a sign of just how irrelevant optical drives are for today's
                    users, but this seems like a good time to remember a bygone
                    era of physical media that wasn't so long ago. So farewell,
                    mid-2012 13-inch MacBook Pro—honestly, most of us didn't
                    miss you by this point.

                    Known as SKAMPI, the [tele]'scope was designed by a team
                    whose members hailed from ten nations and built in China.
                    The model tested last week was assembled in 2018 in the
                    Karoo region of South Africa, which will host some of the
                    SKA's thousands of 'scopes.

                    that technical commissioning work such as "system
                    evaluation, radio frequency interference testing and
                    performance testing took place until early 2022."

                  <p>
                    That effort helped the SKA team to create system design

                    to enable robotic operations of the instrument, and

                    "We have performed first-light observations with SKAMPI in
                    the S-band at frequencies between 1.75 and 3.5GHz,
                    demonstrating the telescope's spectral and pulsar
                    capabilities with imaging of the radio emission of the
                    Southern Sky and detection of the Vela pulsar," reported
                    SKAMPI project scientist Hans-Rainer Klöckner of the Max
                    Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR).

                    [...] While SKAMPI has been a success, much remains to be
                    done. Work on this 'scope will inform development of the
                    197-dish SKA-Mid telescope – currently under construction in

                    spread across 512 sites.

                    The study, conducted in 2022 between April and October,
                    analyzed EEG data recorded on each of 92 participants
                    immediately before and after they undertook a 40-minute
                    walk. Half walked through Red Butte, the arboretum in the
                    foothills just east of the university, and half through the
                    nearby asphalt-laden medical campus.<br />...<br />"The
                    participants that had walked in nature showed an improvement
                    in their executive attention on that task, whereas the urban
                    walkers did not, so then we know it's something unique about
                    the environment that you're walking in," McDonnell said. "We
                    know exercise benefits executive attention as well, so we
                    want to make sure both groups have comparable amounts of
                    exercise."

                    What sets this study apart from much of the existing
                    research into the human-nature nexus is its reliance on EEG
                    data as opposed to surveys and self-reporting, which do
                    yield helpful information but can be highly subjective.

                    surreptitiously sent commands to hundreds of infected small
                    office and home office routers to remove malware China
                    state-sponsored hackers were using to wage attacks on
                    critical infrastructure.

                    Pi change? Will there be turnover and some of the people who

                    Doctorow gave a speech on the topic at last year's DEF CON
                    infosec conference, and his analysis is gaining traction on
                    all sides of the political and technological spectrum.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Doctorow suggested enshittification of services
                    happens due to the kind of management that such
                    mega-companies demand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Traditionally, CEOs progress in a large company by taking a
                    new idea and growing it into a valuable business unit. It
                    worked for Microsoft's Satya Nadella in developing cloud
                    platforms for Redmond, and Andy Jassy followed a similar
                    route to success with Amazon after pioneering AWS.
                    Meanwhile, Sundar Pichai oversaw the growth of ChromeOS
                    before taking leadership at Alphabet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Doctorow thinks that the same process might also harm
                    innovation. Uneasy lies the head that bears the crown, and
                    CEOs might be unwilling to promote major new innovations –
                    he cited the failure of social network Google+ as a classic
                    example.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the end it should be possible to reverse the
                    current trend and reintroduce a more competitive technology
                    industry environment that can spur innovation, spread the
                    wealth, and grow more efficient for users, employers, and
                    investors.

                    The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
                    (ICANN) has proposed creating a new top-level domain (TLD)
                    and never allowing it to be delegated in the global domain
                    name system (DNS) root.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The proposed TLD is .INTERNAL and, as the name implies, it's
                    intended for internal use only. The idea is that .INTERNAL
                    could take on the same role as the 192.168.x.x IPv4 bloc –
                    available for internal use but never plumbed into DNS or
                    other infrastructure that would enable it to be accessed
                    from the open internet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ICANN's Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC)
                    advised the development of such a TLD in 2020. It noted at
                    the time that "many enterprises and device vendors make ad
                    hoc use of TLDs that are not present in the root zone when
                    they intend the name for private use only. This usage is
                    uncoordinated and can cause harm to Internet users" – in
                    part by forcing DNS servers to handle, and reject, queries
                    for domains only used internally.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] ICANN's board still has to sign off the creation of
                    .INTERNAL. But if you want to get ahead of the pack, there's
                    nothing stopping you. Indeed, some outfits already use ad
                    hoc TLDs. Open source Wi-Fi firmware project WRT has used
                    .LAN, and networking vendor D-Link has employed .dlink.
                  </p>
                  <p>There's nothing stopping you doing likewise.</p>
                  <p>
                    But as ICANN's proposal for the idea noted: "Operators who
                    choose to use private namespaces of the kind proposed in
                    this document should understand the potential for that
                    decision to have corresponding costs, and that those costs
                    might well be avoided by choosing instead to use a
                    sub-domain of their own publicly registered domain name."

                    Great whites, the largest predatory sharks in the world with
                    the most fatal attacks on humans, are tough to imagine as
                    newborn babies. That is partially because no one has seen
                    one in the wild, it seems, until now.

                  <p>
                    Wildlife filmmaker Carlos Gauna and UC Riverside biology
                    doctoral student Phillip Sternes were scanning the waters
                    for sharks on July 9, 2023, near Santa Barbara on
                    California's central coast. That day, something exciting
                    appeared on the viewfinder of Gauna's drone camera. It was a
                    shark pup unlike any they'd ever seen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Great whites, referred to only as white sharks by
                    scientists, are gray on top and white on the bottom. But
                    this roughly 5-foot-long shark was pure white.

                    "We enlarged the images, put them in slow motion, and
                    realized the white layer was being shed from the body as it
                    was swimming," Sternes said. "I believe it was a newborn
                    white shark shedding its embryonic layer."

                  <p>
                    These observations are documented in a new paper in the
                    Environmental Biology of Fishes journal. The paper also
                    details the significance of having seen a live newborn white
                    shark.

                    grails of shark science. No one has ever been able to
                    pinpoint where they are born, nor has anyone seen a newborn
                    baby shark alive," Gauna said. "There have been dead white
                    sharks found inside deceased pregnant mothers. But nothing
                    like this."

                    By clocking the speed of stars throughout the Milky Way
                    galaxy, MIT physicists have found that stars further out in
                    the galactic disk are traveling more slowly than expected
                    compared to stars that are closer to the galaxy's center.
                    The findings raise a surprising possibility: The Milky Way's
                    gravitational core may be lighter in mass, and contain less
                    dark matter, than previously thought.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new results are based on the team's analysis of data
                    taken by the Gaia and APOGEE instruments. Gaia is an
                    orbiting space telescope that tracks the precise location,
                    distance, and motion of more than 1 billion stars throughout
                    the Milky Way galaxy, while APOGEE is a ground-based survey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The physicists analyzed Gaia's measurements of more than
                    33,000 stars, including some of the farthest stars in the
                    galaxy, and determined each star's "circular velocity," or
                    how fast a star is circling in the galactic disk, given the
                    star's distance from the galaxy's center.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team translated the new rotation curve into a
                    distribution of dark matter that could explain the outer
                    stars' slow-down, and found the resulting map produced a
                    lighter galactic core than expected. That is, the center of
                    the Milky Way may be less dense, with less dark matter, than
                    scientists have thought.

                    Spreadsheet blunders aren't just frustrating personal
                    inconveniences. They can have serious consequences. And in
                    the last few years alone, there have been a myriad of
                    spreadsheet horror stories.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    for a data leak of "monumental proportions" when a
                    spreadsheet that contained statistics on the number of
                    officers it had and their rank was shared online in response
                    to a freedom of information request.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There was a second overlooked tab on the spreadsheet that
                    contained the personal details of 10,000 serving police
                    officers.

                    $10.5 million (£8.3 million) instead of $100 into the
                    account of an Australian customer due to an incorrect number
                    being entered on a spreadsheet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The clerk who processed the refund for the Australian
                    customer had wrongly entered her bank account number in the
                    refund field in a spreadsheet. It was seven months before
                    the mistake was spotted. The recipient attempted to flee to
                    Malaysia but was stopped at an Australian airport carrying a
                    large amount of cash.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Industry studies show that 90 percent of spreadsheets
                    containing more than 150 rows have at least one major
                    mistake. This is understandable because spreadsheet errors
                    are easy to make but difficult to spot. My
                    <a href="https://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol25/iss1/34/"
                      >own research</a
                    >
                    has shown that inspecting the spreadsheet's code is the most
                    effective way of debugging them, but this approach still
                    only catches between 60 and 80 percent of all errors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To break the cycle of repeated spreadsheet errors,
                    there are several things organisations can do. First,
                    introducing standardization would help to minimize confusion
                    and mistakes. For example, this would mean consistent
                    formatting, naming conventions, and data structures across
                    spreadsheets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, improving training is crucial. Equipping users with
                    the knowledge and skills to build robust and accurate
                    spreadsheets could help them identify and avoid pitfalls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, fostering a culture of critical thinking toward
                    spreadsheets is vital. This would mean encouraging users to
                    continually question calculations, validate their data
                    sources, and double-check their work.

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                We are running very short of time for creating a new site. We
                have one member of staff who has already volunteered for a post
                on the Board; other staff are already busy with their existing
                roles. We are looking for an additional 2 community members who
                wish to serve on a temporary Board so that we can create a new
                company and purchase the data, domains and other assets from the
                current site. But perhaps I should explain a little further....
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board should, as a minimum, consist of 3 people, A Chairman,
                a Secretary and the site's Accountant. These people will be
                named at the creation of the new company and will each assume
                one of those formal roles. There are implications to this.
                Firstly, the company data is not publicised widely but we can
                make no guarantee that it will always remain hidden from public
                view, either by a change in US law or by, for example, the
                action of an hacker. Therefore, any volunteers must be prepared
                to waive his/her anonymity although as things stand it should
                never actually be compromised. Secondly, this is a temporary
                post. The latest draft of Bylaws is a very good starting point
                but it has become apparent that they are not perfect. There will
                be changes required to the Bylaws and, when they have been
                changed and accepted by the Community, all posts on the Board
                must be filled by people who have been elected by the community.
                You could, of course, stand for election at that time if you so
                wish.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, we are only looking at putting names to roles so that
                we can create a company. Your experience and skill level are not
                the most important aspects. We will employ an professional
                accountant to produce the annual formal account reporting and it
                will not simply be left to our own 'Accountant'. Rather, the
                role is one of providing checks and balances for any expenditure
                and the management of the site's accounting records.
              </p>
              <p>
                How long the 'temporary' role will last is not something that we
                can currently forecast. But I would estimate it to be weeks or
                months rather than a long term responsibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think any sensible person would agree that we cannot simply
                pass control of the site and finances to unknown people so we
                must limit applications from those who have held an account for
                at least 6 months and have contributed to the site. The staff
                will treat all applications as sensitive data and we will only
                refer to individuals by their user name in any discussions or at
                subsequent meetings. We will, of course, need to know your true
                identity and contact details for the creation of the new
                company.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a chance for us to move the site to a new start and to
                ensure that we can provide continuity of stories each day for
                everyone to enjoy. We will all be involved - Board, staff and
                community - in producing new policy documents that are a
                reasonable balance between discussions and freedom of speech. We
                are almost at our 10th birthday. Many people did not expect us
                to reach our 1st birthday. I would like to see the site looking
                forward to many more birthdays to come.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can only achieve this with your help. The are approximately
                250 unique accounts, excluding ACs, active on the site each week
                although not all commenting in stories. We are only looking for
                2 volunteers.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you wish to volunteer please send your email giving your
                username to admin@soylentnews.org with the word "volunteer" in
                the subject. All emails will be treated in the strictest
                confidence. Time is of the essence so please don't delay in
                contacting us should you wish to volunteer.

              <p>
                <b>UPDATE: 31 Jan 2004</b>: We have the volunteers that we need
                to create a new company, many thanks to them for stepping
                forward. However, if you feel that you have something to offer
                and you wish to volunteer also then please do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is still some preparatory work to be done but I am doing
                that as quickly as I am able within my current time limitations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another point worth noting which may, or may not, be related is
                that the number of active accounts has gone over the 300 mark
                for the first time in many months. There are probably many more
                who are lurking or posting solely as AC.

                Now that the poles are melting, and that seven of the world's
                ten biggest shipping companies have suspended transit through
                the Red Sea, and that deforestation is drying up the Panama
                Canal, the site <i>Modern Diplomacy</i> raises the question,

                    Increasingly, yes — and for a worrying reason. The Arctic is
                    warming four times faster than the global average. Since
                    1978 ice cover has shrunk by roughly 78,000 square
                    kilometres per year. In June 2023 a study in Nature
                    Communications, a journal, suggested that the Arctic's first
                    ice-free summer could come as soon as the 2040s, even if the
                    world significantly reduces its greenhouse-gas emissions. As
                    ice thins and cold-water shipping technology advances,
                    Arctic waters will become more easily navigable.

                  <p>
                    They are already getting busier, if from a low base. The
                    most popular shipping route in the Arctic is the nsr, which
                    is controlled by Russia. Trade volumes along the route
                    increased by 755% between 2014 and 2022. Russia wants
                    traffic to increase ten-fold from 2022 levels by 2035. In
                    October it announced a joint venture with DP World, an
                    Emirati logistics company, to develop Arctic container
                    shipping. That month NewNew Shipping Line, a Chinese firm,
                    completed its first round-trip on an Arctic route between
                    Shanghai and St Petersburg.

                    [...] The Arctic will struggle to rival established shipping
                    routes. Extreme seasonal weather limits its potential for
                    commercial shipping. But as the ice cover shrinks, its
                    waters will become busier — and Russia will make ever
                    greater use of them.

                    A nearly invisible dwarf galaxy is challenging the model of
                    dark matter. An international team of astronomers, led by
                    the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) in

                    Nube, which means "Cloud" in Spanish, was named by the
                    5-year-old daughter of one of the researchers, aptly
                    reflecting the galaxy's ghostly and diffuse appearance. Its
                    discovery is significant because its faint surface
                    brightness allowed it to remain undetected in previous sky
                    surveys, despite its considerable size.

                    large and yet faint, a ghostly apparition in the universe.

                    What sets it apart is its significant amount of dark matter,
                    an invisible substance that does not emit, absorb, or
                    reflect light, making it undetectable by traditional

                    Hertz, which has made a big push into electric vehicles in
                    recent years, has decided it's time to cut back. The company
                    will sell off a third of its electric fleet, totaling
                    roughly 20,000 vehicles, and use the money they bring to
                    purchase more gasoline powered vehicles.

                    Electric vehicles have been hurting Hertz's financials,
                    executives have said, because, despite costing less to
                    maintain, they have higher damage-repair costs and, also,
                    higher depreciation.

                    "[C]ollision and damage repairs on an EV can often run about
                    twice that associated with a comparable combustion engine
                    vehicle," Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr said in a recent analyst
                    call.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And EV price declines in the new car market have pushed down
                    the resale value of Hertz's used EV rental cars.

                    [...] For rental car companies like Hertz, which sell lots
                    of vehicles in the used car market, depreciation has a big

                    deciding which cars to have in their fleets.

                    The FTC declined to comment on whether the order also
                    applies to data purchases by intelligence agencies. In
                    defining "location data," the FTC order seems to carve out
                    exceptions for any data collected outside the US and used
                    for either "security purposes" or "national security
                    purposes conducted by federal agencies or other federal
                    entities."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NSA officials told Wyden that not only is the intelligence
                    agency purchasing data on Americans located in the US but
                    that it also bought Americans' Internet metadata.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In response to Wyden's letter to Haines, the Under
                    Secretary of Defense for Intelligence &amp; Security, Ronald
                    Moultrie, said that the Department of Defense (DoD) "adheres
                    to high standards of privacy and civil liberties
                    protections" when buying Americans' location data. He also
                    said that he was "not aware of any requirement in US law or
                    judicial opinion" forcing the DoD to "obtain a court order
                    in order to acquire, access, or use" commercially available
                    information that "is equally available for purchase to
                    foreign adversaries, US companies, and private persons as it
                    is to the US government."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In another response to Wyden, NSA leader General Paul
                    Nakasone told Wyden that the "NSA takes steps to minimize
                    the collection of US person information" and "continues to
                    acquire only the most useful data relevant to mission
                    requirements." That includes some commercially available
                    information on Americans "where one side of the
                    communications is a US Internet Protocol address and the
                    other is located abroad," data which Nakasone said is
                    "critical to protecting the US Defense Industrial Base" that
                    sustains military weapons systems.

                    from 32.8% last year to 35.7% this year. Links from over a
                    decade ago have a fifty per cent chance of no longer
                    working. Thankfully, only three out of over 550 have gone
                    missing in the last few years of links, but only time will
                    tell how long they'll stick around.

                As pointed out in the early and mid 1990s, the inherent
                centralization of sites, later web sites, is the basis for this
                weakness. That is to say one single copy exists which resides
                under the control of the publisher / maintainer. When that one
                copy goes, it is gone.

                    Despite technical and non-technical countermeasures, humans
                    continue to be tricked by phishing emails. How users make
                    email response decisions is a missing piece in the puzzle to
                    identifying why people still fall for phishing emails. We
                    conducted an empirical study using a think-aloud method to
                    investigate how people make 'response decisions' while
                    reading emails. The grounded theory analysis of the in-depth
                    qualitative data has enabled us to identify different
                    elements of email users' decision-making that influence
                    their email response decisions. Furthermore, we developed a
                    theoretical model that explains how people could be driven
                    to respond to emails based on the identified elements of
                    users' email decision-making processes and the relationships
                    uncovered from the data. The findings provide deeper
                    insights into phishing email susceptibility due to people's
                    email response decision-making behavior. We also discuss the
                    implications of our findings for designers and researchers
                    working in anti-phishing training, education, and awareness
                    interventions.

              <p>The conclusion:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    In this paper, we investigate in-depth how people make email
                    response decisions while reading their emails. Analysis of
                    the collected qualitative data enabled us to develop a
                    theoretical model that describes how people can be driven to
                    respond to emails by clicking on email links and replying to
                    or downloading attachments based on people's email response
                    decision-making elements and their relationships. Based on
                    an improved understanding of how people make email
                    responses, this study enables us to identify how people can
                    be susceptible to manipulation, even in our controlled
                    experiment environment. We proposed five concrete
                    enhancements to state-of-the-art anti-phishing education,
                    training, and awareness tools to support users in making
                    safe email responses. Among others, we suggest that the goal
                    of anti-phishing education, training, and awareness tools
                    should shift from accurate email legitimacy judgments to
                    secure email responses. Therefore, we believe our work lays
                    the foundation for improving future anti- phishing
                    interventions to make a significant difference in how we
                    prevent phishing email attacks in the future.

                    A recent study published in Ecological Informatics by a team
                    of University of Alaska Fairbanks researchers has used
                    artificial intelligence to further illuminate a habitat swap
                    among short-billed gulls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Typically gulls live along coastlines and near water sources
                    such as rivers. They feed on bugs and other small mammals,
                    fish or birds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team found that from May to August, short-billed gulls
                    occupied areas that have typically been the haunts of
                    scavenging ravens. Those include supermarket and fast-food
                    restaurant parking lots and other human-made structures,
                    such as industrial gravel pads and garbage dumpsters.

                  <p>
                    The study is the first of its kind to compile a three-year
                    dataset using a citizen science-based, opportunistic
                    research method to include a large sample of gulls and other
                    sub-Arctic birds in urban Alaska. The study provides a
                    current snapshot of the habitat shift to an urban landscape.

                  <p>
                    UAF professor Falk Huettmann, first author on the paper, and
                    his team used artificial intelligence modeling that was
                    given predictors—environmental variables for specific
                    locations—to extrapolate information about the gull
                    occurrences. A similar, earlier study analyzed the
                    distribution of the great gray owl.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this study, researchers used U.S. census data as well as
                    urban municipality data, such as distances to roads,
                    restaurants, waterways and waste transfer stations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Using socioeconomic datasets like the U.S. census is a real
                    game-changer," said Moriz Steiner, a graduate student in
                    Huettmann's lab. "It allows us to mirror the real-world
                    environment and simulate a situation as true to nature as
                    possible by including them as variables in the models."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings indicate that the gulls' transition from
                    natural habitats to a more urban landscape is spurred by the
                    availability of human food, as well as industrial changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "They are exploiting the waste opportunity left behind by
                    humans," said Huettmann, who is associated with UAF's
                    Institute of Arctic Biology.

                    With this letter, written by Gary Gygax to wargaming zine
                    publisher Jim Lurvey, one of the founders of what would
                    become TSR announced that a January 1974 release for <em

                      >pointed out by the Grognardia blog</a

                    date for the "anniversary" of <em>D&amp;D</em>. The first
                    sale was in "late January 1974," Gygax later wrote, and on
                    the last Sunday of January 1974, Gygax invited potential
                    customers to drop by his house in the afternoon to try it
                    out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You could argue whether a final draft, printing,
                    announcement, sale, or first session counts as the true
                    "birth" of <em>D&amp;D</em>, but we have to go with
                    something, and Peterson's reasoning seems fairly sound.
                    Gygax's memory, and a documented session at his own house,
                    are a good point to pin down for when we celebrate this
                    thing that has shaped a seemingly infinite number of other
                    things.

                    As with playing a good campaign, you've got a lot of options
                    for how you acknowledge <em>D&amp;D</em>'s long presence and
                    deep influence. The game system itself, now under Wizards of
                    the Coast, will this year push "One D&amp;D," a name the
                    <em>D&amp;D</em> leaders sometimes stick with and sometimes
                    don't. Whatever the next wave is called, it includes new
                    handbooks, guides, and <em>Monster Manual</em> books that
                    are

                    >
                    but also an evolution. Books like
                    <em>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</em> and
                    <em>Tasha's Cauldron of Everything</em> will be codified and
                    unified by a new sourcebook at some point, but all of it
                    will be compatible with <em>5th Edition</em> material.

                    you rush. Ten different designs, leaning heavily on the
                    dragons, were commissioned based on existing illustrations.

                    Yet the researchers did notice something. They directed a
                    laser at the sample made of glass. The molecules within it
                    scatter the light. The scattered beams overlap and form a
                    chaotic pattern of light and dark spots on the camera's
                    sensor. Statistical methods can be used to calculate how the
                    fluctuations vary over time—in other words, how fast the
                    material's internal clock ticks. "This requires extremely
                    precise measurements which were only possible using
                    state-of-the-art video cameras," says Blochowicz.

                    But it was worth it. The statistical analysis of the
                    molecular fluctuations, which researchers from Roskilde
                    University in Denmark helped with, revealed some surprising
                    results. In terms of material time, the fluctuations of the
                    molecules are time-reversible. This means that they do not
                    change if the material time is allowed to tick backwards,
                    similar to the video of the pendulum, which looks the same
                    when played forwards and backwards.

                    Of course, there is a reason for the separation of the
                    closing and locking functions, but not the opening and
                    unlocking functions: it avoids a Denial of Service attack
                    where someone can just press "close" and then jump out
                    before the door closes. If the interior "close" button
                    automatically locked the door, this would result in the
                    toilet becoming permanently inaccessible.

                    The problem with this design is that most people don't
                    understand state machines, and this design confused a lot of
                    people who were unable to lock the door correctly, or
                    believed they'd locked the door when they hadn't.

                The result is a denial of service, being able to lock the door
                from the inside while no one is actually inside to subsequently
                unlock the door again.

                    Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the bacteria used in the study, can
                    naturally consume polyethylene as a food source. The RPI
                    team tackled the challenge of engineering this bacteria to
                    convert the carbon atoms of polyethylene into a genetically
                    encoded silk protein. Surprisingly, they found that their
                    newly developed bacteria could make the silk protein at a
                    yield rivaling some bacteria strains that are more
                    conventionally used in biomanufacturing.

                    unlike the way plastics are produced today, our process is
                    low-energy and doesn't require the use of toxic chemicals,"
                    Zha said. "The best chemists in the world could not convert
                    polyethylene into spider silk, but these bacteria can. We're
                    really harnessing what nature has developed to do

                    'Now I'm going to teach you how to slurp,' says Kathryn
                    Sinclair, senior brand ambassador at British tea firm
                    Twinings. 'We taste from the olfactory glands and we need to
                    open these up, so breathe in through the mouth, breathe out
                    through the mouth and slurp.' She noisily sucks up the
                    pale-coloured liquid using a soup spoon. I try the same,
                    experiencing a slightly sweet and fresh floral taste. This
                    is tea number one – white tea – in the Twinings tea master
                    class held at the company's 300-year old shop on the Strand
                    in London. Sinclair notes that white tea is a young leaf
                    that is rich in antioxidants and which has the highest
                    caffeine content out of all the tea types because it is the
                    least processed. 'White tea is the purest form of tea,' she
                    explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ultimately, however, the differences in tea types come
                    down to chemistry, and this chemistry is influenced by
                    cultivation, environment, weather and, importantly,
                    processing. 'From the chemistry perspective, tea is the
                    ultimate mystery and challenge to food and analytical
                    chemists,' says Nikolai Kuhnert, a chemist at Jacobs
                    University in Bremen, Germany. 'No food material is more
                    fascinating and chemically diverse and complex.'
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, more research is required into the specific
                    health properties of tea and its chemicals. There are
                    concerns around the health impact of caffeine and, as yet,
                    the US Food and Drug Administration has been slow to
                    recognise the benefits of tea, Melican says. 'Personally, I
                    drink nearly a quart of tea a day. I am 75 years old,
                    healthy, active and still work a 50-hour week – so there may
                    be something in it.'
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Drinking tea has been popular for millennia. Slowly the
                    science is starting to reveal the complex chemical nature of
                    our favourite brew. 'In the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy,
                    the Nutri Matic drink dispenser is unable to provide Arthur
                    Dent with a good cup of tea. Now the science can explain
                    why,' says Kuhnert: 'It's just too complicated.'

                    known as password spraying to exploit a weak credential for
                    logging into a "legacy non-production test tenant account"
                    that wasn't protected by multifactor authentication. From
                    there, they somehow acquired the ability to access email
                    accounts that belonged to senior executives and employees
                    working in security and legal teams. A "pretty big config

                    updating customers on findings from its ongoing
                    investigation, Microsoft provided more details on how the
                    hackers achieved this monumental escalation of access. The
                    hackers, part of a group Microsoft tracks as Midnight
                    Blizzard, gained persistent access to the privileged email
                    accounts by abusing the OAuth authorization protcol, which
                    is used industry-wide to allow an array of apps to access
                    resources on a network. After compromising the test tenant,
                    Midnight Blizzard used it to create a malicious app and
                    assign it rights to access every email address on
                    Microsoft's Office 365 email service.

                    Add a dash of creamer to your morning coffee, and clouds of
                    white liquid will swirl around your cup. But give it a few
                    seconds, and those swirls will disappear, leaving you with
                    an ordinary mug of brown liquid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Something similar happens in quantum computer chips --
                    devices that tap into the strange properties of the universe
                    at its smallest scales -- where information can quickly
                    jumble up, limiting the memory capabilities of these tools.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That doesn't have to be the case, said Rahul Nandkishore,
                    associate professor of physics at the University of Colorado
                    Boulder.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new coup for theoretical physics, he and his colleagues
                    have used math to show that scientists could create,
                    essentially, a scenario where the milk and coffee never mix
                    -- no matter how hard you stir them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The group's findings may lead to new advances in quantum
                    computer chips, potentially providing engineers with new
                    ways to store information in incredibly tiny objects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Think of the initial swirling patterns that appear when you
                    add cream to your morning coffee," said Nandkishore, senior
                    author of the new study. "Imagine if these patterns
                    continued to swirl and dance no matter how long you
                    watched."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers still need to run experiments in the lab to make
                    sure that these never-ending swirls really are possible. But
                    the group's results are a major step forward for physicists
                    seeking to create materials that remain out of balance, or
                    equilibrium, for long periods of time -- a pursuit known as
                    "ergodicity breaking."

                    "T cells have the ability to develop memory and persist in
                    your body for really long periods, which is very different
                    from a chemical drug. With CAR T cells, you have the
                    potential of getting this one treatment, and then that's it.
                    For chronic pathologies, that's a huge advantage. Think

                    Deepfakes use artificial intelligence (AI) to make a video
                    of someone by manipulating their face or body. A study in
                    2023 found that there has been a 550% rise in the creation
                    of doctored images since 2019, fuelled by the emergence of
                    AI.

                  <p>
                    US Representative Joe Morelle called the spread of the
                    pictures "appalling".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a statement, X said it was "actively removing" the images
                    and taking "appropriate actions" against the accounts
                    involved in spreading them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It added: "We're closely monitoring the situation to ensure
                    that any further violations are immediately addressed, and
                    the content is removed." While many of the images appear to
                    have been removed at the time of publication, one photo of
                    Swift was viewed a reported 47 million times before being
                    taken down.

                    [...] There are currently no federal laws against the
                    sharing or creation of deepfake images, though there have
                    been moves at state level to tackle the issue.

                    In the UK, the sharing of deepfake pornography became
                    illegal as part of its Online Safety Act in 2023.

                    Someday in the not too distant future, it might no longer be
                    possible to drive a brand-new car faster than 80 mph in
                    California. That's because state senator Scott Wiener
                    earlier this week proposed a new bill that aims to prevent
                    certain new vehicles from going more than 10 mph over the
                    speed limit. In California, the maximum posted speed limit
                    is 70 mph, meaning anything north of 80 mph would be off
                    limits.

                    The Speeding and Fatality Emergency Reduction on California
                    Streets—or SAFER California Streets, for short—is a package
                    of bills that includes SB 961 that was published Tuesday,
                    which essentially calls for speed governors on new cars and
                    trucks built or sold in California starting with the 2027
                    model year. These vehicles would be required to have an
                    "intelligent speed limiter system" that electronically
                    prevents the driver from speeding above the aforementioned
                    threshold.

                    A California lawmaker announced a bill Wednesday that would
                    require new passenger vehicles and large trucks sold in
                    California to be equipped with technology that would prevent
                    them from going more than 10 miles an hour above the speed
                    limit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If passed, Senate Bill 961 would require vehicles, beginning
                    with model year 2027, that are manufactured or sold in
                    California to come with a speed governor, also known as an
                    intelligent speed limiter. It would make California the
                    first state in the nation to mandate this technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These devices match a vehicle's global positioning system
                    (GPS) location with a database of speed limits to figure out
                    what speed a vehicle should be traveling at during any given
                    time. They also sometimes use onboard cameras to read speed
                    limit signs. With this information, the devices are then
                    able to prevent the driver from speeding more than 10 miles
                    an hour above the speed limit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Drivers would be able to temporarily override the speed
                    governor device, according to the proposal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The requirement for speed governors would not apply to
                    emergency vehicles.

                I for one can't wait for the hackers to change the database so
                freeway speed limits are 15 MPH.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    As digital devices progressively replace pen and paper,
                    taking notes by hand is becoming increasingly uncommon in
                    schools and universities. Using a keyboard is recommended
                    because it's often faster than writing by hand. However, the
                    latter has been found to improve spelling accuracy and
                    memory recall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To find out if the process of forming letters by hand
                    resulted in greater brain connectivity, researchers in
                    Norway now investigated the underlying neural networks
                    involved in both modes of writing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We show that when writing by hand, brain connectivity
                    patterns are far more elaborate than when typewriting on a
                    keyboard," said Prof Audrey van der Meer, a brain researcher
                    at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and
                    co-author of the study published in
                    <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Such widespread brain connectivity is known to be crucial
                    for memory formation and for encoding new information and,
                    therefore, is beneficial for learning."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers collected EEG data from 36 university
                    students who were repeatedly prompted to either write or
                    type a word that appeared on a screen. When writing, they
                    used a digital pen to write in cursive directly on a
                    touchscreen. When typing they used a single finger to press
                    keys on a keyboard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    High-density EEGs, which measure electrical activity in the
                    brain using 256 small sensors sewn in a net and placed over
                    the head, were recorded for five seconds for every prompt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Connectivity of different brain regions increased when
                    participants wrote by hand, but not when they typed. "Our
                    findings suggest that visual and movement information
                    obtained through precisely controlled hand movements when
                    using a pen contribute extensively to the brain's
                    connectivity patterns that promote learning," van der Meer
                    said.

                    Chipmaker TSMC had a mixed final calendar quarter of 2023,
                    with profit falling less than expected and revenue growth
                    “essentially flat,” in another sign that the global
                    semiconductor downturn is over.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chief executive CC Wei said of the quarter: “Our business
                    has bottomed out on a year-over-year basis, and we expect
                    2024 to be a healthy growth year for TSMC, supported by
                    continued strong ramp of our industry-leading 3nm
                    technologies, strong demand for the 5nm technologies and
                    robust AI-related demand.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Looking at TSMC’s production of wafer shipments during
                    the quarter, 5nm was the largest single process node by
                    revenue, at 35 percent. 7nm accounted for another 17
                    percent, while the current most advanced 3nm nodes accounted
                    for 15 percent of revenue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The latter figure shows that 3nm uptake is indeed
                    increasing, as it made up just 6 percent of TSMC’s wafer
                    revenue in the previous quarter. Older nodes such as 16nm
                    still accounted for 8 percent, with 28nm at 7 percent, but
                    advanced nodes, which TSMC now defines as 7nm or better,
                    accounted for 67 percent of wafer revenue for this quarter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “2023 was a challenging year for the global
                    semiconductor industry, but our technology leadership
                    enabled TSMC to outperform the foundry industry,” Huang
                    commented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He also struck an optimistic note looking ahead, telling
                    investors that: “Despite a challenging 2023, our revenue
                    remains well on track to grow between 15 and 20 percent CAGR
                    over the next several years in US dollar terms, which is the
                    target we communicated back in the January 2022 investor
                    conference,” Huang commented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chief exec Wei added he expected the overall semiconductor
                    market, excluding memory, to increase by more than 10
                    percent during 2024. Analyst Gartner recently
