                    is the company behind Gorilla Glass, a break-resistant glass
                    used to protect screens that’s used on essentially all of
                    the most popular smartphones. Today, the European Commission
                    <a
                      href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_5681"
                      >announced an investigation into</a
                    >
                    Corning for anti-competitive practices, alleging that the
                    glassmaker is preventing competition through exclusive
                    supply agreements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the press release, Corning requires mobile
                    phone manufacturers to source all or nearly all of their
                    alkali-AS glass from it, and it also grants rebates to these
                    companies if they do so. Additionally, these phone makers
                    must tell Corning if they receive competitive offers from
                    other glass manufacturers. They aren’t allowed to accept
                    these offers unless Corning cannot match or beat the price.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similarly, Corning has agreements with companies that
                    process raw glass, forcing them to get all or most of their
                    alkali-AS glass from Corning. They also aren’t allowed to
                    challenge Corning patents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These charges reinforce how aggressive Corning is in
                    defending its dominant position in the smartphone glass
                    screen market. The latest Apple and Android devices, like
                    the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-9-review-the-go-to-android-smartphone-133005548.html"
                      >Google Pixel 9</a
                    >, usually have Gorilla Glass screens, as they’re
                    scratch-resistant and prevent cracking or breaking. While
                    not indestructible, the glass does hold up well against
                    damage. However, Corning’s market dominance coupled with
                    these practices are enough to get the EU’s attention.

                    “We in public health need to cast a wider net of who we
                    offer a test,” said Shah at a press conference today. “Going
                    forward, the CDC is expanding its testing recommendation to
                    include workers who were exposed [to H5N1] and do not have
                    symptoms.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The agency is also recommending that antiviral medications
                    be offered to asymptomatic workers who have a high-risk
                    exposure, like those on dairy farms who may get raw milk
                    splashed on their face. That way, if they do contract the
                    virus, a lower amount of it will be circulating within them,
                    which in turn lowers the risk of it spreading to other
                    people. “The less room we give this virus to run, the fewer
                    chances we give it to change,” said Shah.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This data also highlights that many H5N1 cases are going
                    undetected – a concern public health officials have long
                    suspected to be true. Yet “we can’t speculate on how many
                    unidentified cases there may be” until we have more data,
                    said Shah.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The CDC is now analysing an additional 150 blood samples
                    collected from veterinarians who work with cattle. When
                    these results become available, they should provide us with
                    a clearer picture of how many cases may be slipping through
                    the cracks, said Shah.

                on a UN-backed treaty which could become the global framework
                for investigating cybercriminals.
              </p>

                    The Biden administration plans to support a controversial
                    cybercrime treaty at the United Nations this week despite
                    concerns that it could be misused by authoritarian regimes,
                    according to senior government officials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The agreement would be the first legally binding UN
                    agreement on cybersecurity and could become a global legal
                    framework for countries to cooperate on preventing and
                    investigating cybercriminals. However, critics fear it could
                    be used by authoritarian states to try to pursue dissidents
                    overseas or collect data from political opponents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the officials said there are persuasive reasons to
                    support the treaty. For instance, it would advance the
                    criminalization of child sexual-abuse material and
                    nonconsensual spreading of intimate images, they said.<br />[...]<br />While
                    the treaty is expected to pass the vote in the UN, it was
                    highly unlikely it would be ratified by the US government
                    unless there was implementation of human-rights controls,
                    the official said.

                What say you, Soylentils? "If you have nothing to hide, you have
                nothing to fear?", "We can't let those authoritarian scum
                further oppress their dissidents!" Something in between?

                    In short, cybersecurity in the public sector is a critical
                    matter to society. It should be treated as such. It is not.
                    Unlike transport infrastructure, environment, food and
                    health, it is not regulated. If an aircraft crashes or a
                    novel infection breaks out, certain bodies have a legal duty
                    to investigate and report.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] We need an accident investigator for cybersecurity,
                    one with the power to keep senior execs awake at nights, one
                    to whom nobody can say no. One that looks for reasons, not
                    blame.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the long term, it will save money and lives, make
                    everything easier for everyone with responsibility to keep
                    the wolves in the forest. In the medium term, it will shake
                    up expectations and practices across the sector. And in the
                    short term, it will be exceedingly entertaining. We own the
                    public sector. We set the rules. Let's make it happen.

                    unspecified “national security risks” posed by the company
                    and its parent ByteDance. With the move, TikTok will be
                    forced to “wind up” all business in the country, though the

                    Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne said in a
                    statement. “The decision was based on the information and

                    Canada’s crackdown on TikTok follows a “multi-step national

                    Canadian offices and destroying hundreds of well-paying

                    will remain available for creators to find an audience,

                    The statement further expressed deep concern over "the

                    North Korea is not legally allowed to develop or possess
                    nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles under international
                    agreements. It withdrew as a signatory to the Treaty on the
                    Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 2003, citing
                    national security concerns. The United Nations Security

                    A possible ancient shoreline has been found in the region of
                    Mars explored by the Chinese rover Zhurong, providing
                    further evidence that an ocean may once have covered a vast

                    at Hong Kong Polytechnic University and his colleagues have
                    conducted a comprehensive analysis of the topographic
                    features in the landing area, combining remote sensing data
                    from satellites with observations from the rover.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They say they have found features consistent with the
                    existence of a shoreline in southern Utopia Planitia,
                    including troughs and sediment channels. They also dated and
                    identified the composition of surface deposits in the area.
                    Based on this, the team thinks the ocean existed 3.68
                    billion years ago, but froze and then disappeared around 260
                    million years later.

                    “The findings not only provide further evidence to support
                    the theory of a Martian ocean but also present, for the
                    first time, a discussion on its probable evolutionary
                    scenario,” says Wu.

                    At the heart of the energy transition is a metal transition.
                    Wind farms, solar panels, and electric cars require many
                    times more copper, zinc, and nickel than their gas-powered
                    alternatives. They also require more exotic metals with
                    unique properties, known as rare earth elements, which are
                    essential for the magnets that go into things like wind
                    turbines and EV motors.

                    Today, China dominates the processing of rare earth
                    elements, refining around 60 percent of those materials for
                    the world. With demand for such materials forecasted to

                    world today. The catch is they’re mixed with vast quantities
                    of toxic mining waste.

                    materials, including rare earth metals and nickel, from
                    mining waste. The company uses water and recyclable solvents
                    to collect oxidized metal, then puts the metal into a heated
                    molten salt mixture and applies electricity.

                    Now, with support from the Department of Energy, Phoenix
                    Tailings is expanding the list of metals it can produce and
                    accelerating plans to build a second production facility.

                    [...] “The key for all of this isn’t just the chemistry, but
                    how everything is linked together, because with rare earths,
                    you have to hit really high purities compared to a
                    conventionally produced metal,” Villalón explains. “As a
                    result, you have to be thinking about the purity of your
                    material the entire way through.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Villalón says the process is economical compared to
                    conventional production methods, produces no toxic
                    byproducts, and is completely carbon free when renewable
                    energy sources are used for electricity.

                    The Woburn facility is currently producing several rare
                    earth elements for customers, including neodymium and
                    dysprosium, which are important in
                    magnets<strong>. </strong>Customers are using the materials
                    for things likewind turbines, electric cars, and defense
                    applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “We want to take our knowledge from processing the
                    rare earth metals and slowly move it into other segments,”
                    Villalón explains. “We simply have to refine some of these
                    materials here. There’s no way we can’t. So, what does that
                    look like from a regulatory perspective? How do we create
                    approaches that are economical and environmentally compliant
                    not just now, but 30 years from now?”

                    Every day, billions of cells in the human body die thanks to
                    a natural process known as apoptosis. When apoptosis doesn't
                    work by design, cells get cancerous and can cause a
                    life-threatening illness. Now, researchers at Stanford
                    University are working on a novel way to treat, and possibly
                    kill for good, a specific type of cancer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers' recently published
                    <a

                    describes a way to re-activate apoptosis in mutated cells,
                    which would amount to forcing cancer to self-destruct
                    through a bioengineered, bonding molecule.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gerald Crabtree, one of the study's authors and a professor
                    of development biology,
                    <a
                      href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/10/protein-cancer.html"

                    he had the idea while hiking through Kings Mountain,
                    California, during the pandemic period. The new compound
                    would have to bind two proteins which already exist in the
                    cancerous cells, turning apoptosis back on and making the
                    cancer kill itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We essentially want to have the same kind of specificity
                    that can eliminate 60 billion cells with no bystanders,"
                    Crabtree said, so that no cell gets destroyed if it isn't
                    the proper target of this new killing mechanism. The two
                    proteins in question are known as BCL6, an oncogene which
                    suppresses apoptosis-promoting genes in the B-cell lymphoma,
                    and CDK9, an enzyme that catalyzes gene activation instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mutated BCL6 proteins block a signal that should normally
                    bring cancerous cells to activate apoptosis. Traditional,
                    non-destructive cancer treatments have been targeting
                    oncogenes to try and shut the cancer down, while the new
                    study proposes a mechanism to exploit them instead. "You
                    take something that the cancer is addicted to for its
                    survival and you flip the script and make that be the very
                    thing that kills it," Crabtree said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team is now testing the molecule on mice affected
                    by diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, to see if the method is
                    effective at killing cancer in living animals. The technique
                    relies on the natural supply of BCL6 and CDK9 in cells,
                    which means it will likely work only on cancerous lymphomas.
                    After testing the new molecule with 859 different types of
                    cancer cells in the lab, the researchers confirmed that it
                    was able to kill only diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma
                    cells.

                    position sensing system? Well you're in luck — all you need
                    is some circuit board, a basic microcontroller, and a wee

                  <p>Why make calipers?</p>
                  <p>
                    Electronic calipers are awesome. This $30 pair has served me
                    well for years, reading far more precision than my skills
                    justify:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such calipers work via capacitive coupling between a PCB on
                    the powered slidey display and a passive PCB "scale" in the
                    stationary spine.

                    Back in March, I idly wondered if the same working principle
                    could be used for a cheap and cheerful "maker-friendly"
                    positioning system. E.g., slide some passive PCB scales into
                    an aluminum extrusion rail, add a capacitive pickup to the
                    bottom of whatever carriage you've got riding along, and
                    tada — you've got sub-mm closed-loop positioning. All for
                    the cost of some PCB, a few GPIO pins, and some firmware (so
                    free, basically).

                    desktop processors returned to us due to instability issues,
                    we have determined that elevated operating voltage is
                    causing instability issues in some 13th/14th Gen desktop
                    processors," explained Intel communications manager Thomas
                    Hannaford. "Our analysis of returned processors confirms
                    that the elevated operating voltage is stemming from a
                    microcode algorithm resulting in incorrect voltage requests

                    of the issue, which the company refers to as "Vmin Shift
                    Instability." Vmin refers to the minimum voltage for a chip
                    to operate properly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Intel has localized the Vmin Shift Instability issue to a
                    clock tree circuit within the IA core which is particularly
                    vulnerable to reliability aging under elevated voltage and
                    temperature," the chipmaker said. "Intel has observed these
                    conditions can lead to a duty cycle shift of the clocks and
                    observed system instability."

                  <p>
                    Intel has issued three microcode patches to address the
                    issue: 0x125 in June 2024 to adjust its Enhanced Thermal
                    Velocity Boost (eTVB) algorithm; 0x129 in August 2024 to
                    address high voltages requested by the processor; and 0x12B,
                    announced in September 2024, which incorporates the previous
                    two updates and also prevents the processor from requesting
                    elevated voltage when idle or under light load.

                    Elwood Edwards, the voice of AOL's "You've Got Mail"
                    greeting, has died at age 74 after a long illness, according

                      >a 2016 interview</a
                    >, Edwards recounted how he became the voice of AOL. His
                    wife, who worked at Quantum Computer Services (which later
                    became AOL), heard that the company was looking to add a
                    voice to its software. "I'd been an announcer throughout my
                    entire broadcasting career, and she volunteered me," Edwards
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1989, Edwards recorded the once-ubiquitous phrase, along
                    with "Welcome," "Files done," and "Goodbye" on a cassette
                    tape for just $200. "It started off as a test just to see if
                    it would catch on, and lo and behold, in the mid-90s, it had
                    really caught on."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since then, Edwards has made appearances

                    As a longtime AOL user (yes, I still use AOL to this day),
                    I'm ashamed to admit that I never knew there was a person
                    behind that iconic voice — I thought it was
                    computer-generated. Even now, Edwards' voice will continue
                    to live on in my inbox, which still declares, "You've Got
                    Mail."

                    Administrators are reporting unexpected appearances of
                    Windows Server 2025 after what was published as a security
                    update turned out to be a complete operating system upgrade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem was
                    <a
                      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1gk2qdu/windows_2022_servers_unexpectedly_upgrading_to/"
                      >flagged</a
                    >
                    by a customer of web app security biz Heimdal. Arriving at
                    the office on the morning of November 5, they found, to
                    their horror, that every Windows Server 2022 system had
                    either upgraded itself to Windows Server 2025 or was about
                    to.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sysadmins are cautious by nature, so an unplanned operating
                    system upgrade could easily result in morning coffee being
                    sprayed over a keyboard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Heimdal's services include patch management, and it relies
                    on Microsoft to label patches accurately to ensure the
                    correct update is applied to the correct software at the
                    correct time. In this instance, what should have been a
                    security update turned out to be Windows Server 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It took Heimdal a while to trace the problem.
                    <a
                      href="https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1gk2qdu/windows_2022_servers_unexpectedly_upgrading_to/lvl4of4/"
                      >According to a post</a
                    >
                    on Reddit: "Due to the limited initial footprint,
                    identifying the root cause took some time. By 18:05 UTC, we
                    traced the issue to the Windows Update API, where Microsoft
                    had mistakenly labeled the Windows Server 2025 upgrade as
                    KB5044284."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It added: "Our team discovered this discrepancy in our
                    patching repository, as the GUID for the Windows Server 2025
                    upgrade does not match the usual entries for KB5044284
                    associated with Windows 11. This appears to be an error on
                    Microsoft's side, affecting both the speed of release and
                    the classification of the update. After cross-checking with
                    Microsoft's KB repository, we confirmed that the KB number
                    indeed references Windows 11, not Windows Server 2025."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As of last night, Heimdal estimated that the unexpected
                    upgrade had affected 7 percent of customers – it said it had
                    blocked KB5044284 across all server group policies. However,
                    this is of little comfort to administrators finding
                    themselves receiving an unexpected upgrade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since rolling back to the previous configuration will
                    present a challenge, affected users will be faced with
                    finding out just how effective their backup strategy is or
                    paying for the required license and dealing with all the
                    changes that come with Windows Server 2025.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    An online blogger in China recently asked: how do you clean
                    a flask? But the Mandarin word for flask is xi-jing-ping,
                    which sounds like the name of China's leader, Xi Jin Ping.
                    Government censors suspected the writer was really asking,
                    "How do you get rid the president of China?" They took down
                    the query.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If someone online in China refers to President Xi as a
                    "paratrooper," they may not be hailing him as rugged and
                    resourceful. Paratrooper in Mandarin is san bing, which
                    sounds much like the word for "idiot."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    China's Cyberspace Administration and Ministry of Education
                    has begun what they call the Clear and Bright Campaign to
                    prune the web in China of what they consider "irregular and
                    uncivilized language."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The language bureaucrats aren't just watching for criticism
                    of President Xi, mentions of the Tiananmen Square massacre,
                    or demonstrations in Hong Kong. They want to extinguish the
                    seemingly innocuous phrases many Chinese have ingenuously
                    appropriated to express dissent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When a Chinese censor finds an "irregular" phrase,
                    they eliminate it, but call it "harmonizing". He-xie, the
                    Mandarin word for harmony, sounds like the word for river
                    crab, and so people who have been censored report they have
                    been "river-crabbed."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then there's Cao Ni Ma, the Mandarin name for the mythical
                    grass mud horse. It sounds similar to a phrase that is so
                    profane, I can't even hint at it. The Mandarin phrase for
                    "cover your middle parts", dang zhong yang, sounds close to
                    the name of the Chinese Party Central Committee. And so the
                    artist Ai Weiwei created a music video in which voices sing
                    out, "Grass mud horse and cover your middle part!" in
                    "Gangnam Style," and, "Grass mud horse and river crab!"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wen'guang Huang says the video can't be seen in China, of
                    course. But people there have heard about it, and might hum
                    it in hushed tones. The tune is catchy and appealing — like
                    free speech.

                    Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile are continuing their fight
                    against fines for selling user location data, with two of
                    the big three carriers submitting new court briefs arguing
                    that the Federal Communications Commission can't punish

                    "Verizon's petition for review stems from the multiple and
                    significant errors that the FCC, in purporting to enforce
                    statutory consumer data privacy provisions, made in
                    overstepping its authority," Verizon wrote. "The FCC's
                    Forfeiture Order violated both the Communications Act and
                    the Constitution, while failing to benefit the consumers it
                    purported to protect."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Verizon and AT&amp;T both said the fines violate their
                    Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, and that the
                    location data doesn't fall under the law cited by the FCC.
                    Verizon appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the 2nd
                    Circuit, while AT&amp;T appealed in the 5th Circuit and
                    T-Mobile appealed in the DC Circuit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fines are $80.1 million for T-Mobile, $57.3 million for
                    AT&amp;T, $46.9 million for Verizon, and $12.2 million for
                    T-Mobile subsidiary Sprint. The penalties relate to the

                So what say you, Soylentils? Are AT&amp;T and Verizon correct in
                saying that the FCC has no authority to levy fines? Is selling
                your location data without your consent ethical/legal? If you
                answer 'no' to both, who <i>does</i> have such authority? If you
                answer 'yes' to both, why? If you mix 'yes' and 'no', why?

                    hundreds of thousands of victims in the process.

                    Victims who buy products are presented with a legitimate
                    payment processor page, so the transaction is technically
                    real - but there's no product, and nothing ever shows up.

                  <p>
                    Satori said it managed to get the fake listings it
                    discovered pulled from Google SERPs, and victimized payment
                    processors have banned Phish 'n' Ships operators from their
                    platforms, but it's probably not safe yet.

                    You may have seen a photo floating around the Internet that
                    depicts a gaggle of Mavericks—not the pickup, but the
                    econo-coupe that preceded it—lurking in what appears to be
                    some type of natural cave. Dig a little deeper, and you
                    might even stumble across a sentence or two explaining that
                    these unlikely spelunkers represent overstock stuffed by
                    Ford into a subterranean system carved deep beneath the
                    bedrock of Missouri.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The image might seem an oddball anachronism, some kind of
                    temporary solution to overflowing dealer lots that somehow
                    made sense in the 1970s. Would it surprise you to find out
                    that Ford is actually entering its seventh decade of keeping
                    cars in said caves, which are part of a vast business
                    complex called SubTropolis?
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    Although Hunt Midwest works with other automotive partners
                    at SubTropolis, Ford is truly the anchor tenant. With its
                    Kansas City plant still building the F-150 pickup (as it has
                    since 1957), and another nearby Missouri facility churning
                    out the Transit van, the company's underground presence has
                    grown alongside both of those product lines.

                    The densely populated island state is moving from what it
                    calls Electric Road Pricing (ERP) 1.0 to ERP 2.0. The first
                    version used gantries – or automatic tolls – to charge
                    drivers a fee through an in-car device when they used
                    specific roadways during certain hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ERP 2.0 sees the vehicle instead tracked through GPS, which
                    can tell where a vehicle is at all operating times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "ERP 2.0 will provide more comprehensive aggregated traffic
                    information and will be able to operate without physical
                    gantries. We will be able to introduce new 'virtual
                    gantries,' which allow for more flexible and responsive
                    congestion management,"

                    But the island's government doesn't just control inflow into
                    urban areas through toll-like charging – it also
                    aggressively controls the total number of cars operating
                    within its borders.

                    Singapore requires vehicle owners to bid for a set number of
                    Certificates of Entitlement – costly operating permits valid
                    for only ten years. The result is an

                    of around SG$100,000 ($75,500) every ten years, depending on
                    that year's COE price, on top of a car's usual price. The
                    high total price disincentivizes mass car ownership, which
                    helps the government manage traffic and emissions.

                    Between ERP 2.0, a plan to one day charge based on distance
                    instead of per gantry entry, improvements in mass transit
                    links, and “evolving” traffic patterns sparked by an
                    increase in flexible work arrangements, Singapore reckons it
                    can handle the extra traffic from 20,000 cars.

                    as a “guest star” by astronomers in ancient China and Japan
                    <em>(SN: 4/17/02)</em>. Astronomers didn’t find the remains
                    of that explosion, now called the Pa 30 nebula, until 2013.

                  <p>
                    And when they did find the remnant, it looked weird. The
                    supernova appeared to be a kind called type 1a, wherein a
                    white dwarf star

                    >
                    <em>(SN: 3/23/16)</em>. But in this case, part of the star
                    survived.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Stranger still, the star was surrounded by spiky filaments
                    stretching about three light-years in all directions. “This
                    is really unique,” Cunningham says. “There’s no other
                    supernova nebula that shows filaments like this.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Researchers still aren’t sure how the filaments
                    formed, or how they’ve maintained their straight-line shapes
                    for centuries. One possibility is that a shock wave from the
                    explosion ricocheted off the diffuse material between stars
                    and bounced back toward the white dwarf. That wave could
                    have sculpted the material into the spikes astronomers see.
                    Future theoretical studies using the new observations might
                    help solve the puzzle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study did show that this remnant is almost definitely
                    from the guest star of 1181. Taking the speeds and positions
                    of the filaments and tracing them backward show they all
                    emanated from the same point around the year 1152, give or
                    take 75 years.

                    The Southampton team developed a "nervous system" for drones
                    using optical fibers to continuously monitor strains and
                    stresses, similar to how nerves relay information in the
                    human body. Unlike traditional electrical monitoring, this
                    system uses light signals, which helps avoid the
                    interference issues common in electronic setups.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The monitoring system works through a technique called
                    "optical speckle," where specific images are projected based
                    on detected strains and stresses. AI algorithms then analyze
                    these patterns to assess potential damage, alerting crews
                    when issues arise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Initial test flights integrating the nervous system on an
                    undergraduate drone project were promising. According to an
                    aerospace student leading the project, the live data showed
                    that fiber optic technology could significantly extend
                    flight duration by reducing the need for manual inspections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The drone was first developed to deliver life-saving
                    equipment like defibrillators in emergencies, but it's
                    served as an excellent test platform for the optical fiber
                    nervous system. What really excited us was seeing the live
                    data from the fiber system. It showed that the technology
                    could keep drones operational longer without extensive
                    ground crews,"

                  <p>
                    The researchers believe their self-monitoring system holds
                    immense potential across industries. They aim to
                    commercialize the technology as early as 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Drones capable of continuously assessing their own
                    structural integrity could prove invaluable for applications
                    such as cargo transport, emergency response deliveries, and
                    other sectors that would benefit from extended flight times
                    without frequent landing requirements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although initial testing was conducted on a small student
                    drone, these smaller drones don't typically need full
                    inspections between flights. The technology would likely be
                    most beneficial for larger cargo drones that endure greater
                    operational stress.

                    These community owned networks usually have broad,
                    bipartisan support. And they routinely offer locals
                    symmetrical gigabit fiber for as little as $70 a month,
                    without usage caps, weird fees, long-term contracts, and
                    other misleading crap. They tend to treat broadband as an
                    essential utility and public good, with a priority on
                    consumers. You can see why AT&amp;T and Comcast wouldn’t
                    like that.

                    [...] But it’s a pretty tired playbook at this point.
                    Regional telecom giants dismantle all meaningful competition
                    via regulatory capture, take billions in subsidies for
                    networks they don’t consistently upgrade, raise prices
                    endlessly, and then fund covert attacks on anybody that
                    <em>might dare do things differently</em>, whether that’s
                    reformers at key regulatory agencies, or locals trying to
                    build their own reliable fiber network.

                  <p>
                    None of this is to say that community broadband networks are
                    some kind of <em>magic panacea</em>. Like any business plan,
                    they’re highly dependent on smart budgeting and savvy local
                    leadership. But they’ve proven time and time again that not
                    only are they a useful way to upgrade long-neglected
                    communities, they’re a lovely motivator for entrenched
                    regional monopolies that simply stopped trying years
                    earlier.

                pipelines connecting planned key hydrogen import, production and
                consumption centra within Germany. The network, proposed by the

                The approval process was sped up under the 2022

                enhance competition, security of supply and sustainable energy

                network, in exchange for state-backed loans and state guarantees
                to bridge the time until utilisation rates rise and tariff
                revenues exceed cost.

                Countries bordering the North Sea (like Germany), aim to scale
                offshore wind capacity from under 30 GW to 120 GW by 2030 and
                300 GW by 2050. Hydrogen is seen as an effective storage medium
                for excess energy production here.

                While the concept has always been to run DC cables from the
                offshore wind farms on land, and produce the hydrogen there, a

                suggests that it is more efficient to locate the hydrogen
                production at sea, too -- and transport the produced hydrogen on
                land by pipeline.

                    not to use any drugs made by a compounding pharmacy in
                    California after regulators realized the pharmacy was making
                    drugs that need to be sterile—particularly injectable
                    drugs—without using sterile ingredients or any sterilization
                    steps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The products made by the pharmacy, Fullerton Wellness LLC,
                    in Ontario, California, include semaglutide [...]
                    tirzepatide<br />[...]<br />The FDA became aware of the
                    problem after a patient submitted a complaint to the
                    regulator that a vial of semaglutide from Fullerton Wellness
                    had an unidentified "black particulate" floating in it.
                    Semaglutide, like tirzepatide, is injected under the skin
                    and is intended to be sterile.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Injecting a "non-sterile drug intended to be sterile may
                    result in serious and potentially life-threatening adverse
                    health consequences including infections and sepsis," the
                    FDA warned.<br />[...]<br />This is just the latest warning
                    on weight-loss drugs from the FDA, which has repeatedly
                    cautioned about quality and safety problems related to
                    compounded versions of the drugs. The compounded drugs are
                    intended to be essentially copycat versions of the
                    blockbuster brand-name drugs. Compounding pharmacies can
                    make copycat versions only as long as the drugs are in short
                    supply, acting as a stopgap for patient access. But, with
                    the popularity of the drugs and the high prices of the
                    brand-name versions, compounded formulations have become
                    seen as affordable alternatives for many patients.<br />[...]<br />Also
                    in October, Novo Nordisk
                    <a
                      href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2017-N-2562-0029"

                      versions of semaglutide</a
                    >, arguing that the drug is too complex for compounders to
                    make and poses too many safety risks to patients. In
                    response, the trade organization for compounders, the
                    Outsourcing Facilities Association, submitted

                    An exquisitely preserved fossilised tadpole is the oldest
                    ever discovered by science, dating back 161 million years,
                    with an anatomy that is strikingly similar to some of

                    “They did not achieve their goal,” says Mariana Chuliver at
                    Maimonides University in Buenos Aires, Argentina. “However,
                    after many days of digging, one team member found a stone
                    with a particular imprint on it – a fossil tadpole.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chuliver and her colleagues have now identified the tadpole
                    as belonging to the extinct frog species
                    <em>Notobatrachus degiustoi</em>, deciphered from the
                    hundreds of adult specimens found in the same fossil deposit
                    since 1957.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Until now, scientists had never unearthed tadpole
                    <a

                    from before the Cretaceous Period, which began around 145
                    million years ago. This specimen is also the first ever
                    fossilised tadpole from an earlier frog lineage known as
                    stem anurans, which predates modern species, known as crown
                    anurans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fossil was so well preserved that eyes and nerves are
                    visible in its head, as well as a forelimb and part of its
                    tail. The team estimates it would have been around 16
                    centimetres long, comparable to the biggest tadpoles that
                    exist today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The tadpole’s size also paints a picture of the kinds
                    of habitat that frogs evolved in more than 160 million years
                    ago – lots of water with few predators or competitors, she
                    says. “Something modern frog species can only dream about.”

                    Thousands of Dubliners showed up for the city's
                    much-anticipated Halloween parade on Thursday evening. They
                    lined the streets from Parnell Street to Christchurch

                  <p>
                    Over the remainder of the night, sleuths gradually teased
                    out the culprit: a website based in Pakistan that consists
                    solely of listings for Halloween events, some real and some
                    totally made-up. Possibly the first clue that the Dublin
                    parade was in the latter category was
                    <a

                    >
                    implication that Cristiano Ronaldo and MrBeast might appear.
                    But in the days before the non-event, hype started trickling
                    down via social media posts from actual people, which makes
                    it harder to claim Dubliners should have known—if you see a
                    friend posting about a Halloween parade, why wouldn't you
                    believe there was going to be a Halloween parade?

                    content. Every autumn, lots of people search for Halloween
                    events nearby, and a site entirely devoted to cataloguing
                    them will naturally rise in the Google rankings, which
                    incentivize lots of things that are not necessarily

                    [...] That a fake listing for a Halloween parade would even
                    be a thing anyone would want to create and promote is a

                    Nokia is investigating whether a third-party vendor was
                    breached after a hacker claimed to be selling the company's
                    stolen source code.

                    "Nokia takes this allegation seriously and we are

                    This statement comes after a threat actor known as

                    stolen after they breached a third-party vendor's server.

                    The amended ISA also states the co-located load "is not
                    intended to consume capacity and/or energy from the PJM
                    transmission system [the grid]," but it is "possible that it
                    will."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Exelon and AEP expressed concern that it was unclear what
                    steps have been taken to ensure any such withdrawal of power
                    from the grid would be properly metered and accurately
                    billed when it does occur, and who would be financially
                    responsible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In its summary, FERC said PJM had not demonstrated that its
                    proposed "non-conforming" provisions in the amended ISA are
                    necessary deviations from the existing agreement, and
                    therefore rejected it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One dissenting voice was FERC Chairman Willie L Phillips,
                    who claimed the order was "a step backward for both electric
                    reliability and national security." He said he believed that
                    PJM had addressed reliability issues comprehensively in its
                    filing, and the ruling risks America's leadership in AI
                    because "reliable electricity is the lifeblood" of the
                    datacenters required for developing AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, Commissioner Mark C Christie explained that
                    co-location arrangements of this type present "an array of
                    complicated, nuanced, and multifaceted issues, which
                    collectively could have huge ramifications for both grid
                    reliability and consumer costs," and it was being rejected
                    because PJM had failed to meet its burden of proof.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the proposed amendment were approved at this time, he
                    warned: "we would be setting a precedent that would be used
                    to justify identical or similar arrangements in future
                    cases."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The move highlights the difficulties datacenter operators
                    face in expanding their facilities to keep pace with the
                    booming demand for training and operating the latest AI
                    models, and the challenges that power companies face in
                    delivering the energy required.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, thanks to the efforts of a team of scientists from
                    Scandinavia, Iceland, and Ireland, we have direct, tangible
                    evidence that the Well Man really existed – in the form of
                    bones, freshly analyzed, discovered at the bottom of the
                    very well described.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Well Man is barely a throwaway line describing a
                    conflict that took place in 1197 CE – a corpse thrown into a
                    castle well by an invading force, probably to make any water
                    therein undrinkable by decaying in it. But that throwaway
                    line has suddenly become one of the most significant in the
                    <em>saga</em> – by being the first incident in such a
                    document ever to be linked to real, historical remains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This is the first time that a person described in
                    these historical texts has actually been found," Martin
                    says. "There are a lot of these medieval and ancient remains
                    all around Europe, and they're increasingly being studied
                    using genomic methods."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The event was a stealth attack carried out by the
                    Roman Catholic enemies of King Sverre (known as Baglers, or
                    <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bagal">Bagal</a>,
                    for the crosiers carried by bishops). While he wintered
                    elsewhere, the Baglers invaded his castle in his absence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Thorstein Kugad accepted service with the Bagals, and went
                    with them," the

                      href="https://jillian.rootaction.net/~jay/world_faiths/www.northvegr.org-relative/lore/sverri/019.html"
                      >saga reads</a
                    >. "The Bagals seized all the property in the castle, and
                    then they burnt every building of it. They took a dead man
                    and cast him into the well, and then filled it up with
                    stones. Before they left the castle they called upon the
                    townsmen to break down all the stone walls; and before they
                    marched from the town they burnt all the King's long-ships.
                    After this they returned to the Uplands, well pleased with
                    the booty they had gained in their journey."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the saga, the Baglers spared the people within,
                    leaving them nothing but their clothes – but fresh corpses
                    don't fall from the sky, and it's plausible that the event
                    wasn't completely bloodless. The Well Man may even have been
                    a Bagler himself, slain by the castle's defenders.

                    "The text is not absolutely correct – what we have seen is
                    that the reality is much more complex than the text,"
                    explains archaeologist Anna Petersén of the Norwegian
                    Institute of Cultural Heritage Research.

                    The research also demonstrates the power of a comprehensive
                    genomic database, strong historical records, and how the two
                    can be united to unveil the secrets of the past.

                    In 2022, three companies with strange names and no clear
                    business purpose beyond patent litigation filed dozens of
                    lawsuits in Delaware federal court, accusing businesses of
                    all sizes of patent infringement. Some of these complaints
                    claimed patent rights over basic aspects of modern life;
                    one, for example, involved a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/02/stupid-patent-month-clocking-work-app"

                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These companies–named Mellaconic IP, Backertop Licensing,
                    and Nimitz Technologies–seemed to be typical examples of
                    "patent trolls," companies whose primary business is suing
                    others over patents or demanding licensing fees rather than
                    providing actual products or services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the cases soon took an unusual turn. The Delaware
                    federal judge overseeing the cases, U.S. District Judge Colm
                    Connolly, sought more information about the patents and
                    their ownership. One of the alleged owners was a food-truck
                    operator who had been promised "passive income," but was
                    entitled to only a small portion of any revenue generated
                    from the lawsuits. Another owner was the spouse of an
                    attorney at IP Edge, the patent-assertion company linked to
                    all three LLCs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Following an extensive investigation, the judge determined
                    that attorneys associated with these shell companies had
                    violated legal ethics rules. He pointed out that the
                    attorneys may have misled Han Bui, the food-truck owner,
                    about his potential liability in the case. Judge Connolly
                    wrote:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>

                        and the IP Edge and Mavexar actors who dealt with him
                        underscore that counsel's failures to comply with the
                        Model Rules of Professional Conduct while representing
                        Mr. Bui and his LLC in the Mellaconic cases are not
                        merely technical or academic.

                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Judge Connolly also concluded that IP Edge, the
                    patent-assertion company behind hundreds of patent lawsuits
                    and linked to the three LLCs, was the "de facto owner" of
                    the patents asserted in his court, but that it attempted to
                    hide its involvement. He wrote, "IP Edge, however, has gone
                    to great lengths to hide the 'we' from the world," with "we"
                    referring to IP Edge. Connolly further noted, "IP Edge
                    arranged for the patents to be assigned to LLCs it formed
                    under the names of relatively unsophisticated individuals
                    recruited by [IP Edge office manager] Linh Deitz."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The judge referred three IP Edge attorneys to the Supreme
                    Court of Texas' Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee for
                    engaging in "unauthorized practices of law in Texas." Judge
                    Connolly also sent a letter to the Department of Justice,
                    suggesting an investigation into "individuals associated
                    with IP Edge LLC and its affiliate Maxevar LLC."

                Reaction Engines was the company of Alan Bond, of HOTOL (1980s
                space plane) fame, which he founded to develop new air-breathing
                rocket engine technology. Their flagship project was the Skylon
                Single Stage to Orbit space plane, which would use Synergistic
                Air-Breathing Ram-jet Engines (SABRE) to capture oxygen from the
                atmosphere, cool and compress it and burn it with on-board
                liquid hydrogen up to about Mach 5. Then, at speed and altitude,
                the spacecraft would switch to on-board oxygen stores. In this
                way, more mass fraction could be dedicated to payload, making
                SSTO economically feasible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, based on similar technology was LAPCAT, a hypersonic
                airliner.

                Yet another great British Engineering vision finds its way onto
                the scrapheap for lack of vision among investors. Still, we
                export a lot of cheese.

                    Special Note: When I mention Pascal, I'm including versions
                    like Delphi, Free Pascal, Lazarus, and others that have
                    developed over the years. And regardless of which version
                    you use, these variations of Pascal each bring something
                    unique to the table. Together, they keep Pascal relevant and
                    versatile, offering a range of tools for both new and
                    experienced developers.

                    Tactile controls are back in vogue. Apple added two new
                    buttons to the iPhone 16, home appliances like stoves and
                    washing machines are returning to knobs, and several car
                    manufacturers are reintroducing buttons and dials to
                    dashboards and steering wheels.

                    With this "re-buttonization," as The Wall Street Journal
                    describes it, demand for Rachel Plotnick's expertise has
                    grown. Plotnick, an associate professor of Cinema and Media
                    Studies at Indiana University in Bloomington, is the leading
                    expert on buttons and how people interact with them. She
                    studies the relationship between technology and society with
                    a focus on everyday or overlooked technologies, and wrote
                    the 2018 book Power Button: A History of Pleasure, Panic,
                    and the Politics of Pushing. Now, companies are reaching out
                    to her to help improve their tactile controls.

                  <p>
                    UCLA chemists have discovered a major flaw in a fundamental
                    rule of organic chemistry that has held for 100 years. They
                    say it's time to rewrite the textbooks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Organic molecules, which are primarily made of carbon, have
                    specific shapes and arrangements of atoms. Molecules called
                    olefins contain double bonds, or alkenes, between two carbon
                    atoms. Typically, these atoms and their attached groups lie
                    in the same 3D plane, and deviations from this structure are
                    rare.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rule being questioned, known as Bredt's rule, was
                    established in 1924. It asserts that molecules cannot have a
                    double bond at the "bridgehead" position—the junction of a
                    bridged bicyclic molecule—because this position would
                    distort the geometry of the double bond. Bredt's rule has
                    constrained the design of synthetic molecules by preventing
                    chemists from creating certain structures. Since olefins
                    play a critical role in pharmaceutical research, Bredt's
                    rule has limited the types of molecules that scientists
                    could envision, potentially holding back innovations in drug
                    discovery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A new paper published on November 1 by UCLA scientists in
                    the journal Science has invalidated that idea. They show how
                    to make several kinds of molecules that violate Bredt's
                    rule, called anti-Bredt olefins, or ABOs, allowing chemists
                    to find practical ways to make and use them in reactions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "People aren't exploring anti-Bredt olefins because they
                    think they can't," said corresponding author Neil Garg, the
                    Kenneth N. Trueblood Distinguished Professor of Chemistry
                    and Biochemistry at UCLA. "We shouldn't have rules like this
                    — or if we have them, they should only exist with the
                    constant reminder that they're guidelines, not rules. It
                    destroys creativity when we have rules that supposedly can't
                    be overcome."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "There's a big push in the pharmaceutical industry to
                    develop chemical reactions that give three-dimensional
                    structures like ours because they can be used to discover
                    new medicines," Garg said. "What this study shows is that
                    contrary to one hundred years of conventional wisdom,
                    chemists can make and use anti-Bredt olefins to make
                    value-added products."

                    Apple is committing over a billion dollars more to its
                    existing satellite provider GlobalStar in order to have it
                    expand its ground bases and add more satellites for

                    Now its satellite provider GlobalStar has announced a new
                    expansion of its Apple deal, which comes in two parts. The
                    first has Apple paying up to $1.1 billion in upfront
                    payments specifically so GlobalStar can add what it
                    describes as a new satellite constellation.

                  <p>
                    The second is that Apple has now taken a 20% stake in

                    that is worth approximately $400 million.

                  <p>
                    This announcement is a financial one from GlobalStar, rather
                    than specific news of new features from either it or Apple.
                    But it will result in greater capacity for expanded features
                    on the iPhone.

                Nvidia will replace Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
                indicating the massive impact of the AI boom on the
                semiconductor and tech industries and the entire market.
                According to
                <a
                  href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/nvidia-to-join-dow-jones-industrial-average-replacing-intel.html?s=31"
                  >CNBC</a
                >, this change will happen on November 8, about three months
                after news of Intel's financial woes broke out.
              </p>
              <p>
                The move was sparked by Intel's massive stock price drop—over
                30% overnight—following the disastrous financial results
                released last August. The company has been bleeding cash through
                its data center and foundry divisions, resulting in a $1.6
                billion loss for the second quarter of 2024. This was soon
                followed by news of massive layoffs, with over 15,000 employees
                affected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nvidia shares, on the other hand, have climbed over 170% so far
                in 2024 after jumping roughly 240% last year, as investors have
                rushed to get a piece of the AI chipmaker. Nvidia's market cap
                has swelled to $3.3 trillion, second only to Apple among
                publicly traded companies.

                    Scientists in Virginia are looking for mysterious dark

                    in the universe, shapes and affects the cosmos. But it is
                    entirely invisible and remains undetectable by normal
                    sensors and techniques.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Analyzing billion-year-old rocks, researchers at Virginia
                    Tech hope to find traces of dark matter. The idea was first
                    proposed in the 1980s. Technological advances since then led
                    them to revisit the idea. What if there were traces in
                    Earth's minerals?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's crazy. When I first heard about this idea, I was like
                    — this is insane. I want to do it," physics professor
                    Patrick Huber said in a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Using new imaging, Huber and his colleagues hope to
                    uncover trails of destruction from long-ago dark matter
                    interactions inside crystal lattice structures - a pattern
                    of atoms found in a mineral crystal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dark matter's interactions with other matter is impossible
                    to perceive except when it collides with the nucleus of a
                    visible matter atom. The nucleus recoils from the collision
                    and releases energy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Vsevolod Ivanov, who is collaborating with Huber, explained
                    that when a high-energy particle inside a rock bounces off
                    of the charged core of an atom – the basic building block of
                    matter – inside a rock, backward movement can pop that core,
                    or nucleus, out of place. The gap the nucleus leaves behind
                    marks structural changes within the crystal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We'll take a crystal that's been exposed to different
                    particles for millions of years and subtract the
                    distributions that correspond to things we do know," Ivanov
                    said. "Whatever is left must be something new, and that
                    could be the dark matter."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers are working to identify and locate potential
                    candidates that could be dark matter detectors.

                    Oct 29 (Reuters) - In a case against entertainment behemoth
                    Live Nation (LYV.N), a U.S. appeals court has rejected a
                    common corporate tactic to combat mass consumer arbitration
                    and has cast doubt on whether companies can force consumers
                    into consolidated arbitration protocols.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
                    <a href="https://tmsnrt.rs/3C78yRt">ruled</a> on Monday that
                    Live Nation, the parent company of Ticketmaster, cannot
                    compel its customers to arbitrate antitrust claims because
                    Live Nation's mandatory arbitration provisions were too
                    unfair to be enforceable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As my Reuters colleague Mike Scarcella
                    <a
                      href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/live-nation-must-face-consumer-lawsuit-over-ticket-prices-us-appeals-court-rules-2024-10-28/"
                      >reported</a
                    >, the appeals court concluded that the mass arbitration
                    protocol offered by Live Nation's arbitration provider, New
                    Era, featured rules that were "so dense, convoluted and
                    internally contradictory to be borderline unintelligible."
                    (New Era disputed that characterization, insisting that its
                    rules are "objective [and] easy to understand.")
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    In a concurrence, VanDyke said flatly, "The Federal
                    Arbitration Act just does not apply to the type of mass
                    'arbitration' contemplated by Live Nation's agreements."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That has to be a chilling sentence for companies relying on
                    batch-and-bellwether protocols to mitigate the time and
                    expense of defending thousands of arbitration demands.

                    First, take a 15-kilogram bar of beryllium (or some similar
                    material) and cool it almost all the way to absolute zero,
                    the minimum possible temperature. Sapped of all heat, the
                    bar will sit in its minimum-energy “ground” state. All the
                    atoms of the bar will act together as one quantum system,
                    akin to one hulking atom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, wait until a gravitational wave from deep space passes
                    by. The odds that any particular graviton will interact with
                    the beryllium bar are low, but the wave will contain so many
                    gravitons that the overall odds of at least one interaction
                    are high. The group calculated that approximately one in
                    three gravitational waves of the right sort (neutron star
                    collisions work best since their mergers last longer than
                    black hole mergers) would make the bar ring with one quantum
                    unit of energy. If your bar reverberates in concert with a
                    gravitational wave confirmed by LIGO, you will have
                    witnessed a quantized event caused by gravity.

                    Among a handful of engineering hurdles involved in opening
                    that window, the highest would be putting a heavy object
                    into its ground state and sensing it jumping to its
                    next-lowest-energy state. One of the groups pushing the
                    state of the art on this front is at ETH Zurich, where Fadel
                    and his collaborators cool tiny sapphire crystals until they
                    display quantum properties. In 2023, the team succeeded in
                    putting a crystal into

                    — another hallmark of a quantum system. Its mass was 16
                    millionths of a gram — heavy for a quantum object, but still
                    half a billion times lighter than Pikovski’s bar.
                    Nevertheless, Fadel considers the proposal to be achievable.
                    “It wouldn’t be too crazy,” he said.

                    [...] Now graviton chasers find themselves in a peculiar
                    position. On the main facts, everyone is in agreement. One,
                    detecting a quantum event sparked by a gravitational wave is
                    — surprisingly — possible. And two, doing so would not
                    explicitly prove that the gravitational wave is quantized.
                    “Could you make a classical gravitational wave that would
                    produce the same signal? The answer is yes,” said Carney,
                    who along with two co-authors analyzed this type of
                    experiment in

                    It might motivate subsequent experiments that would take
                    physicists deeper into the quantum gravity era, just as
                    scattering experiments once took them deeper into the era of
                    the photon. Physicists now know that quantum mechanics is
                    much more than quantization. Quantum systems can take on
                    combinations of states known as superpositions, for
                    instance, and their parts can become “entangled” in such a
                    way that measuring one reveals information about the other.
                    Experiments establishing that gravity exhibits these
                    phenomena would provide

                    None of these tests of gravity’s quantum side are completely
                    ironclad, but each would contribute some hard data regarding
                    the finest features of the universe’s weakest force. Now a
                    frigid quantum bar of beryllium appears to be a prime
                    candidate for an experiment that will mark the first step
                    down that long and winding road.

                    Fisker had begun deliveries of its Ocean battery-electric
                    crossover SUV in 2023 to compete with Tesla, but by February
                    2024 the vehicle began having various problems. Some of the
                    problems included suddenly losing power, loss of brake
                    power, defective key fobs, and front hoods opening at high
                    speeds. The vehicle also had difficulties with gear
                    shifting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fisker warned that it may not have enough money to survive
                    the next 12 months in its fourth-quarter earnings report on
                    Feb. 29. Other problems arose as in June, former Fisker
                    employees revealed the company had no plan to stockpile
                    spare parts for Ocean vehicle repairs.

                  <p>
                    The spare parts problem led technicians and employees to

                    In May 2023, Reddit announced that its API would no longer

                    and the start of a new Reddit era. Reddit was always
                    interested in making money, but the social media platform's
                    drive to reach profitability intensified with its API rule
                    changes, which was followed by it

                    and other big moves. With Reddit reporting this week that it
                    has finally turned its first profit, we can expect further
                    evolution from Reddit, whether old-time Redditors like it or
                    not.

                    In its fiscal Q4 2024 results announced on Tuesday [<a
                      href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Reddit-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-2024.pdf"
                      >PDF</a
                    >], Reddit said that in the quarter ending on September 30,
                    it made a profit of $29.9 million. This is significant
                    growth from fiscal Q3 2024, when Reddit lost $7.4 million.
                    Revenue, meanwhile, was up 68 percent year over year, going
                    from $207.5 million to $384.4 million. Reddit is expecting
                    $385 to $400 million in revenue for fiscal Q4.

                  <p>
                    [...] Of course, more users give ads sold on Reddit the
                    chance to gain more eyeballs, something that can help drive
                    ad sales. Reddit's ad revenue has grown alongside its daily
                    user base. In Q3 2024, Reddit made $315.1 million in ad
                    revenue, a 56 percent year-over-year increase.

                    Reddit has historically made the majority of its revenue
                    from ad sales. Huffman has long claimed that Reddit started

                    also fed Reddit's goals of getting users onto its native
                    website and apps—where Reddit sells ads.

                  <p>
                    Reddit is expected to continue its aggressive ads push,
                    including by exploring new ways to incorporate ads into the
                    user experience. For example, Reddit has previously
                    discussed exploring the addition of

                    Much of mathematics is driven by intuition, by a deep-rooted
                    sense of what should be true. But sometimes instinct can
                    lead a mathematician astray. Early evidence might not
                    represent the bigger picture; a statement might seem
                    obvious, only for some hidden subtlety to reveal itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unexpectedly, three mathematicians have now shown that a
                    well-known hypothesis in probability theory called the
                    bunkbed conjecture falls into this category. The conjecture
                    — which is about the different ways you can navigate the
                    mathematical mazes called graphs when they’re stacked on top
                    of each other like bunk beds — seemed natural, even
                    self-evident. “Anything our brain tells us suggests the
                    conjecture should be true,” said
                    <a href="https://web.math.princeton.edu/~mchudnov/"
                      >Maria Chudnovsky</a
                    >, a graph theorist at Princeton University who was not
                    involved in the new work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the mid-1980s, a Dutch physicist named Pieter
                    Kasteleyn wanted to mathematically prove an assertion about
                    how liquids flow throughout porous solids. His work led him
                    to pose the bunkbed conjecture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The bunkbed conjecture says that the probability of
                    finding the path on the bottom bunk is always greater than
                    or equal to the probability of finding the path that jumps
                    to the top bunk. It doesn’t matter what graph you start
                    with, or how many vertical posts you draw between the bunks,
                    or which starting and ending vertices you choose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For decades, mathematicians thought this had to be true.
                    Their intuition told them that moving around on just one
                    bunk should be easier than moving between two — that the
                    extra vertical jump required to get from the lower to the
                    upper bunk should significantly limit the number of
                    available paths.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In June,
                    <a href="https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/lh569"
                      >Lawrence Hollom</a
                    >
                    of the University of Cambridge disproved a version of the
                    bunkbed problem in a different context. Instead of dealing
                    with graphs, this formulation of the conjecture asked about
                    objects called hypergraphs. In a hypergraph, an edge is no
                    longer defined as the connection between a pair of vertices,
                    but rather as the connection between any number of vertices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the meantime, Pak says, it’s clear that
                    mathematicians need to engage in a more active discussion
                    about the nature of mathematical proof. He and his
                    colleagues ultimately didn’t have to rely on controversial
                    computational methods; they were able to disprove the
                    conjecture with total certainty. But as computer- and
                    AI-based lines of attack become more common in mathematics
                    research, some mathematicians are debating whether the
                    field’s norms will eventually have to change. “It’s a
                    philosophical question,” Alon said. “How do we view proofs
                    that are only true with high probability?”
