                    India's Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will next week
                    launch Chandrayaan-3, a mission that aims to land on the
                    moon and deploy a rover.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ISRO yesterday announced that Chandrayaan-3 had been tucked
                    into its capsule and mated with the (LVM-3) launcher that
                    will take it into space. Liftoff from the Satish Dhawan
                    Space Centre has been scheduled for July 14 at 2:35pm IST
                    (09:05 Friday UTC).

                    The ridiculously economical $74.5 million mission aims to
                    land near Luna's south pole in August. From a ramped
                    compartment, the lander will deploy a 26 kilogram rover
                    outfitted with instruments including an Alpha Particle X-ray
                    Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope
                    (LIBS).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lander contains an accelerometer, Ka-band and laser
                    altimeters, Doppler velocimeter, star sensors, inclinometer,
                    touchdown sensor, and cameras for hazard avoidance and
                    positional knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lander also boasts several instruments including
                    Chandra's Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) to
                    measure surface thermal properties, Lunar Seismic Activity
                    (ILSA) to measure tremors around the landing site, Radio
                    Anatomy of Moon Bound Hypersensitive ionosphere and
                    Atmosphere (RAMBHA) to study the gas and plasma environment,
                    and a NASA-provided passive Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA)
                    for lunar ranging studies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A propulsion module that carries the rover and lander will
                    stay in a 100km lunar orbit, where it will act as a
                    communication relay satellite, complete with a payload –
                    known as the Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth
                    (SHAPE) – that studies spectral and polarimetric
                    measurements of Earth from roughly 362,000 to 405,000
                    kilometers away.

                    [...] Only three countries - the USA, Russia, and China,
                    have successfully landed missions on the Moon. Good luck,

                    novels by J.R.R. Tolkien. The set includes many copies of

                    released this week by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
                    revealed that these toxic chemicals are in almost half of

                    manufacturers have known about the public health risks their
                    products posed to the public for decades. The chemicals are
                    already in our environment, the exposure risk will continue
                    to persist until stricter regulations are put in place
                    throughout the country.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    The Intel 8086 microprocessor (1978) started the x86
                    architecture that continues to this day. In this blog post,
                    I'm focusing on a small part of the chip: the address and
                    data pins that connect the chip to external memory and I/O
                    devices. In many processors, this circuitry is
                    straightforward, but it is complicated in the 8086 for two
                    reasons. First, Intel decided to package the 8086 as a
                    40-pin DIP, which didn't provide enough pins for all the
                    functionality. Instead, the 8086 multiplexes address, data,
                    and status. In other words, a pin can have multiple roles,
                    providing an address bit at one time and a data bit at
                    another time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second complication is that the 8086 has a 20-bit
                    address space (due to its infamous segment registers), while
                    the data bus is 16 bits wide. As will be seen, the "extra"
                    four address bits have more impact than you might expect. To
                    summarize, 16 pins, called AD0-AD15, provide 16 bits of
                    address and data. The four remaining address pins (A16-A19)
                    are multiplexed for use as status pins, providing
                    information about what the processor is doing for use by
                    other parts of the system. You might expect that the 8086
                    would thus have two types of pin circuits, but it turns out
                    that there are four distinct circuits, which I will discuss
                    below.

                    has reported. The app delivery platforms are asking for a
                    temporary restraining order against the new rules, set to be
                    implemented on July 12th. "We will not stand by and let the
                    harmful impacts of this earnings standard on New York City
                    customers, merchants, and the delivery workers it was
                    intended to support go unchecked," a DoorDash spokesperson

                    The Worker's Justice Project that backed the survey decried
                    the new lawsuit. "This latest legal maneuver to prop up
                    their business model comes at the expense of workers who can
                    barely survive in a city facing a massive affordability
                    crisis," director Ligia Guallpa told the <em>Post</em>.

                  <p>
                    New York became the first US city to mandate a minimum wage
                    for food delivery workers, ordering platforms to pay workers
                    $17.96 per hour, plus tips, by July 12th. The minimum wage
                    in the city is $15 per hour, but the extra amount accounts
                    for the fact that delivery workers are usually paid as
                    contractors, so have higher taxes and must pay work-related
                    expenses out of pocket. According to an estimate from the
                    DCWP (NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection), NYC
                    has more than 60,000 food delivery workers who earn an
                    average of $7.09 per hour.

                    your body often leads to arrest? Once again, the country's
                    customs have caught someone trying the same old trick. On

                      Increased difficulty in mining Bitcoin positively predicts
                      returns. This supports the theory that as blockchain
                      technology requirements increase, bitcoin's supply is
                      reduced, thus increasing its return.

                    <li>
                      Bitcoin returns are positively driven by investor
                      sentiment, indicating the speculative nature of the
                      cryptocurrency as an asset.

                      Higher stress levels or financial turmoil in the economy
                      cause a decrease in future bitcoin returns, underscoring
                      the risks associated with holding bitcoin as an asset.

                    According to the researchers, bitcoin has functioned in
                    three different economic roles over time: as a form of
                    currency, as a speculative security, and as a safe-haven
                    commodity due to its scarcity and mining costs.

                  <p>
                    When compared to the thousands of other programming
                    languages that have been created in the past 60+ years, PL/I
                    was a success. PL/I reportedly was used in the development
                    of the Multics operating system and the S/360 version of
                    Sabre airline reservation system, among others. PL/I was
                    taught at the college-level. PL/I has been around for
                    decades. Most programming languages would be envious to do
                    half as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But PL/I didn't achieve its strategic goal of consolidating
                    scientific and business computing with the best new
                    programming paradigms that research could provide, and it
                    wasn't for a lack of trying. That goal, although
                    well-intentioned, became impossible as both FORTRAN and
                    COBOL kept accelerating. In terms of adoption, COBOL became
                    the most widely used programming language in the world by
                    1970, and ripping out an existing COBOL system and replacing
                    it with PL/I was going to be a hard sell to customers. The
                    same could surely be said of existing FORTRAN systems. COBOL
                    and FORTRAN also kept accelerating in terms of language
                    definition during the 1960s, making PL/I's feature parity
                    with them not just a challenge, but also ambiguous as it
                    took both COBOL and FORTRAN years to stabilize their own
                    respective standards.

                    curves over about half of all imaginary quadratic fields —
                    by figuring out how to adapt a process for proving
                    modularity pioneered by Wiles and others to elliptic curves
                    over imaginary quadratic fields.

                    [...] The work is a technical achievement in its own right,
                    and it opens the door to making progress on some of the most

                    [...] In the late 1950s, Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimura
                    proposed that there is a perfect 1-to-1 matching between
                    certain modular forms and elliptic curves. The next decade
                    Robert Langlands built on this idea in the construction of
                    his
                    <a
                      href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/videos/the-langlands-program-explained/"

                    If the 1-to-1 correspondence is true, it would give
                    mathematicians a powerful set of tools for understanding the
                    solutions to elliptic curves. For example, there's a kind of
                    numerical value associated with each modular form. One of
                    math's most important open problems (proving it comes with a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium/birch-and-swinnerton-dyer-conjecture/"
                      >million-dollar prize</a
                    >) — the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture — proposes
                    that if that value is zero, then the elliptic curve
                    associated to that modular form has infinitely many rational
                    solutions, and if it's not zero, the elliptic curve has
                    finitely many rational solutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But before anything like that can be tackled, mathematicians
                    need to know that the correspondence holds: Hand me an
                    elliptic curve, and I can hand you its matching modular
                    form. Proving this is what many mathematicians, from Wiles
                    to Caraiani and Newton, have been up to over the last few
                    decades.

                  <p>
                    [...] Their result provides a foundation for investigating
                    some of the same basic questions about elliptic curves over
                    imaginary quadratic fields that mathematicians pursue over
                    the rationals and the reals. This includes the imaginary
                    version of Fermat's Last Theorem — though additional
                    groundwork needs to be laid before that is approachable —
                    and the imaginary version of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
                    conjecture.

                    of the primary auditory cortex for positive human
                    vocalizations from the left appears during human
                    development, and whether this is a uniquely human
                    characteristic. Once we understand this, we may speculate
                    whether it is linked to hand preference or the asymmetric
                    arrangements of the internal organs."

                    Android manufacturers tend to love big spec sheets, even if
                    those giant numbers won't do much for day-to-day phone
                    usage. In that vein, we've got the new high-water mark for
                    ridiculous amounts of memory in a phone. The new
                    <a href="https://www.nubia.com/product/detail/s/2433"
                      >Nubia RedMagic 8S Pro+</a

                    is an Android gaming phone with an option for 24GB of RAM.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The base model of the RedMagic 8S Pro+ starts with 16GB of
                    RAM, but

                    has pictures and details of the upgraded 24GB SKU, which is
                    the most amount of memory ever in an Android phone. Because
                    we're all about big numbers, it also comes with 1TB of
                    storage. [...] This suped-up 24GB version of the phone
                    appears to be a China-exclusive, with the price at CNY 7,499
                    (about $1,034), which is a lot for a phone in China.

                    You definitely want an adequate amount of RAM in an Android
                    phone. All these apps are designed around cheap phones,
                    though, and with Android's aggressive background app
                    management, there's usually not much of a chance to use a
                    ton of RAM. Theoretically, a phone like this would let you
                    multitask better, since apps could stay in memory longer,
                    and you wouldn't have to start them back up when switching
                    tasks. Most people aren't quickly switching through
                    <em>that</em> many apps, though, and some heavy apps, games
                    especially, will just automatically turn off a few seconds
                    once they're in the background.

                There were a few smartphones on the market with 18 GB, but it
                looks like 20 GB has been skipped entirely by Nubia.

                Now we need to be on the lookout for 32 GB of RAM and alien
                technology in upcoming smartphones.

                    NANOGrav's results were published in five papers in The

                    The NANOGrav papers report a "strong evidence" of these
                    long, low-frequency signals, reporting the detection at a
                    3.5- to 4-sigma level, which is less than the 5-sigma
                    threshold that physicists usually want to claim a discovery.
                    But a 4-sigma amplitude is better than the 3.5 sigma from

                    Mandating a simpler cancellation process would confuse
                    consumers and create problems for businesses, trade groups

                    Trade groups representing publishers, advertisers and
                    videogame companies have come out against the Federal Trade
                    Commission's proposed requirement that companies offer
                    consumers an easy click-to-cancel way to get out of
                    subscriptions and memberships.

                  <p>
                    The FTC earlier this year proposed a rule that would require
                    companies to make it as easy for customers to stop recurring
                    charges as it is to sign up to them. That would mean an end
                    to onerous "click to subscribe, call to cancel" routines and
                    other systems designed to introduce friction into the
                    cancellation process.

                    For over a century, scientists have been puzzling over a
                    mysterious, blood-red liquid that's been seeping out of a
                    glacier in Antarctica.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The weird site, later dubbed "Blood Falls," has confounded
                    researchers. But now, a team of researchers at Johns Hopkins
                    may have shed new light on the strange discharge.

                    [...] "As soon as I looked at the microscope images, I
                    noticed that there were these little nanospheres and they
                    were iron-rich, and they have lots of different elements in
                    them besides iron — silicon, calcium, aluminum, sodium — and
                    they all varied," said Ken Livi, a research scientist and
                    coauthor of a

                    The existence of these mysterious nanospheres, which haven't
                    been detected until now, runs counter to the prevailing
                    theory that the blood-red liquid was caused by an abundance
                    of minerals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Minerals are crystalline in nature, while these nanospheres,
                    which are 100 times smaller than red blood cells, aren't.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their existence also sheds new light on the microorganisms
                    and bacteria that have lived for "potentially millions of
                    years underneath the saline waters of the Antarctic
                    glacier," according to Livi.

                    The currents of air that wrap around our planet are becoming

                  <p>
                    The southern part of the jet stream over North America has
                    completely broken apart and is currently trapped in a
                    vicious revolution that has triggered an off-the-chart
                    heatwave.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While it's normal for the air currents to stop, split apart,
                    recombine and flow in opposite directions, on average these
                    tropospheric air streams are typically quite continuous over
                    long distances with an overall west to east flow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The current fragmentation is unlike anything specialists
                    have seen before.

                    [...] Jet streams are known to get 'blocked' on occasion,
                    trapping weather systems in certain regions for days on end.
                    But recent evidence suggests climate change could cause more
                    blockages than usual by slowing down jet streams so they
                    break apart, causing chaotic weather on the ground.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That seems to be what's happening right now in North
                    America, and it's not just climate change that's
                    contributing.

                    Mann explains that El Niño has likely exacerbated the
                    situation, too.

                    Even the average layperson can clearly see the differences
                    when comparing a normal pattern of jet streams to what's
                    occurring today.

                    The Respawn Ninja RN988 is a whitelabel by mwave (an
                    Australian online computer parts retailer). I'm not entirely
                    sure of the OEM, I have not been able to find any matching
                    products with the extra 4th status LED for locking
                    (disabling) the Win key.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After plugging it in I immediately noticed two problems:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1. The switches were definitely not brown-style (tactile
                    bump halfway through being pressed), they were instead
                    red-style (smooth when pressed). Not quite what I wanted but
                    hey for this price I'll happily try it out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2. The Pause, Home, End and numpad * keys were permanently
                    lit up and did not work when pressed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The faulty keys were a serious problem. Every few hours they
                    might fix themselves for a while, but then occasionally spam
                    lots of keyboard input before returning to being broken.

                While it starts out about Tesla self-driving software, it seems
                that the Dawn Project is also taking on security for safety
                critical software in general -- a topic near and dear to many at

                    Dan O'Dowd is a man on a mission: to get Tesla's Full
                    Self-Driving (FSD) technology outlawed. He's likely spent
                    millions of his own money—including a reported $600K on a
                    recent Super Bowl ad and full-page ad in The New York Times
                    last November—to accomplish this goal via his nonprofit
                    group The Dawn Project. And he's incurred the wrath of Elon
                    Musk and the Tesla co-founder and CEO's most rabid fans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Last August The Dawn Project conducted tests and shot
                    a video showing a Tesla Model 3 using FSD plowing into a
                    mannequin meant to represent a child. Tesla sent The Dawn
                    Project a cease-and-desist letter calling the videos
                    "defamatory." O'Dowd responded in a tweet by calling Musk a
                    "crybaby" for complaining about the test and offered to
                    reproduce tests for the media and regulators.

                    That's what brought us to Santa Barbara last week, where
                    Green Hills Software, which O'Dowd founded in 1982 and is
                    president and CEO, is based. Green Hills develops
                    ultra-secure software for aviation, including the operating
                    system (OS) for the Boeing 787 and B1-B bomber and the Orion
                    crew exploration vehicle manufactured by Lockheed Martin and
                    operated by NASA. Green Hills is also the first and only
                    software company to develop an OS that meets the NSA's
                    certification for EAL 6+ High Robustness, making it almost
                    impossible to hack.

                    [...] O'Dowd isn't critical of Tesla vehicles and owns five
                    of them: two Roadsters, two Model 3s, and a Model S. The
                    Dawn Project is not only attacking Tesla FSD but any
                    computer system it deems a danger. "Connecting the power
                    grid, hospitals, and millions of cars to the Internet with
                    software riddled with bugs and security defects has turned
                    these systems into potential weapons of mass destruction at
                    the mercy of hackers," the organization says on its website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We've been taking all the things that our lives depend
                    on—water treatment plants and hospitals—where when something
                    fails thousands or even millions of people could die,"
                    O'Dowd said.

                Just a guess, Mr. O'Dowd is probably not a fan of Microsoft...

                    Google updated its privacy policy over the weekend,
                    explicitly saying the company reserves the right to scrape
                    just about everything you post online to build its AI tools.
                    If Google can read your words, assume they belong to the
                    company now, and expect that they're nesting somewhere in
                    the bowels of a chatbot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Google uses information to improve our services and to
                    develop new products, features and technologies that benefit
                    our users and the public,"
                    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
                      >the new Google policy says</a
                    >. "For example, we use publicly available information to
                    help train Google's AI models and build products and
                    features like Google Translate, Bard, and Cloud AI
                    capabilities."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Previously, Google said the data would be used "for
                    language models," rather than "AI models," and where the
                    older policy just mentioned Google Translate, Bard and Cloud
                    AI now make an appearance.

                  <p>
                    This is an unusual clause for a privacy policy. Typically,
                    these policies describe ways that a business uses the
                    information that you post on the company's own services.
                    Here, it seems Google reserves the right to harvest and
                    harness data posted on any part of the public web, as if the
                    whole internet is the company's own AI playground. Google
                    did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

                    "Over the past 10 years, we've removed about 47 tonnes of
                    snares and bear traps," says Michael Keigwin, the founder of
                    <a href="https://ugandacf.org/"
                      >Uganda Conservation Foundation (UCF)</a

                  <p>
                    Speaking from the Ugandan capital, Kampala, Keigwin is
                    referring to a set of photographs showing a 12-tonne pile of
                    tangled snares and metal traps. The images, showing Ugandan
                    government rangers posing with the traps, illustrate an
                    African success story and a world of pain, say those who
                    helped create it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The pile, nicknamed "snare mountain", was collected over 12
                    months as part of continuing conservation efforts at

                      >Murchison Falls national park</a
                    >. At the bottom are so-called bear traps, used by poachers
                    to catch elephants, hippos and lions. At the top are wire
                    snares used for smaller animals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To put the reusable traps beyond the reach of poachers
                    for good, the pile, like others before it, is being buried
                    in the foundations of the park's new buildings, which
                    include ranger accommodation, an armoury, a veterinary lab
                    and a police station.

                    for park management, ranger and anti-poaching equipment,
                    community development and "ecoguard" training. Ecoguards
                    live in the surrounding communities and their jobs include
                    snare collection and alerting rangers to wildlife that
                    wander out of the park's protected zone and need to be

                    Not coincidentally, India's joining the Artemis Alliance can
                    be seen as a slap at China, an opponent in Asia with whom
                    the country has had armed conflicts in the past. China has
                    its own lunar ambitions that are opposed to the principles
                    of the Artemis Accords. Pakistan, a bitter enemy of India
                    since independence from Great Britain, is planning

                    will be very important for the return to the moon going

                    In conjunction with the 2023 Confidential Computing Summit
                    last week, VMware announced a partnership with tech giants
                    to accelerate the development of confidential computing
                    applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Confidential computing relies on a trusted execution
                    environment that ensures the integrity and confidentiality
                    of applications and data, even in the cloud and on
                    third-party infrastructure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With the emergence of multi-cloud deployments and machine
                    learning, confidential computing is expected to help protect
                    intellectual property and sensitive data, but its adoption
                    lags due to difficulties in creating applications for it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To help overcome obstacles in implementing confidential
                    computing, VMware has been working on<a

                    provides a standardized, platform-agnostic API for building
                    and operating confidential computing applications, which is
                    paired with a policy evaluation server, the Certifier
                    Service.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The accompanying Certifier Service supports trust
                    management, including attestation evaluation, application
                    upgrade, and other related services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] VMware is inviting the community to review and
                    contribute to the open source Certifier Framework, to
                    standardize the platform-independent APIs and to drive the
                    development of confidential computing code for x86, Arm, and
                    RISC-V ecosystems.

                    "Confidential Computing has the potential to secure
                    workloads no matter where they run including in multi-cloud
                    and edge settings. The challenge has been to help customers
                    adopt and implement the standard with ease," VMware CTO Kit
                    Colbert said.

                    Under experimental status, the first flying car has
                    officially been cleared for take off.

                    This week, Alef Aeronautics revealed its flying car "Model
                    A" was granted legal permission from the Federal Aviation
                    Administration to test run the vehicle on the road and in
                    the sky − a move needed before it can be released to the
                    public.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Alef is the first company to receive a Special Airworthiness
                    Certification from the FAA, the company said in a news
                    release. The certification limits the locations and purpose
                    for which the vehicle is allowed to fly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The vehicle will also need to meet National Highway and
                    Traffic Safety Administration safety standards before taking
                    flight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the company's CEO Jim Dukhovny says the company is
                    "hopeful" the certification "will be our next step."

                    [...] The flying car is now available for preorder, the
                    Santa Clara, California-based company posted on its website.
                    Carrying one or two occupants, the vehicle will sell for
                    about $300,000.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The "Model A" is 100% electric, drivable on public roads and
                    has vertical takeoff and landing capabilities, the company
                    wrote in its release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The car will be a Low Speed Vehicle, meaning it won't go
                    faster than about 25 miles per hour on a paved surface. If a
                    driver needs a faster route, they will be able to use the
                    vehicle's flight capabilities, according to Alef.

                    As of Friday, presales were open, with interested customers
                    able to pay a $150 deposit to get on the waiting list, or
                    $1,500 for a priority spot on the list's queue.

                    If humans could not see blue colors, then one of the biggest
                    problems of OLED technology would have been quickly solved,
                    namely the short shelf life of blue OLE diodes. If the need
                    for the blue diodes did not exist, OLED panels could last
                    over 100 years, or about a million hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's what University of Michigan professors Stephen R.
                    Forrest and Chris Giebink said at the recent Display Week in
                    Los Angeles during a four-hour short course designed to look
                    at the current state of OLED technology. But since OLED
                    technology is only a little over 35 years old, these numbers

                    That green OLEDs in particular don't have a problem with
                    durability can definitely be judged in practice by now. When
                    Sony installed green OLED displays in its Walkman almost 20
                    years ago, few would have thought that they would still
                    work. However, the author of these lines owns such an Atrac
                    Walkman himself, whose display still shines in excellent
                    quality.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, only green (or red) displays would only be suitable
                    for special applications. This includes, for example, the
                    digital signage sector For a real display, it is not
                    possible without the color blue and the problems have not
                    been completely solved even 35 years after the emergence of
                    the technology, although they have been greatly reduced.

                    The durability of a panel is increased by various tricks.
                    Important for the blue pixels: They have to stay cool. To
                    achieve this, the surface area is increased and the
                    brightness is reduced in relation to the surface area. In
                    turn, green OLEDs, for example, can be very small and shine
                    extremely brightly. As Forrest said, the green OLEDs in an
                    iPhone shine at around 10,000 candela per square meter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So it's the mix that matters (at the moment). To put that in
                    perspective, even the brightest iPhone Pro only manages
                    1,600 in HDR mode (2,000 outdoors), and that's only in a
                    small space for peak light. Bright light (and thus high
                    temperatures in the panel) reduces the battery life
                    enormously.

                    [...] "I think a lot of consumers — particularly those who
                    diligently track their card expenses — recognize that they
                    use cash so they don't have to think about certain purchases
                    again," Bechler said. "In fact, this strategy of using cash
                    to hide purchases from ourselves if we feel bad about them
                    is something my co-authors and I admitted to doing

                        ECMAScript 2023, the 14th edition, introduced the

                      on array and typed array. Finding an element in an array
                      is a very common programming pattern, the proposal states.
                      Scenarios under which this feature would be used include
                      when a developer knows that finding an element from last
                      to first may have better performance, or developers care
                      about the order of the elements.

                      on the array by returning a new copy of it with the

                So, I know its been a bit quiet here, but we're working through
                getting through the last few items relating to cutting over to
                newer infrastructure. As such, its been working through the bug
                list, and there's one issue I want to get some feedback on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Back in November when the infrastructure was upgraded to Ubuntu
                22.04, a few users with older devices stopped being able to
                connect to SoylentNews. This confused me, since we've been using
                the same NGINX SSL termination setup that has been in use since
                at least 2016. Well, I finally found the root cause, and as it
                turns out,
                <a href="https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/openssl"

                By testing the site with the SSL Labs site checker, it appears
                anything older than Android 4.0, or iOS 5 is broken. This mostly
                seems to be devices that are over a decade old at this point,
                and won't be able to browse the vast majority of sites on the
                Internet as is. We discussed this internally a bit, and I'm of
                the opinion that its not worth re-enabling the older ciphers to
                allow these devices to reconnect, especially since we're working
                to modernize the stack, and get it as up to date as we can get
                it. I also believe we had very few users who were actually
                affected by this, however, as the editors did get a few emails
                about SN breaking after the site upgrade, I wanted to poll the
                community, and make sure this is not a more widespread issue
                than initially believed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, this is going to be part of a broader discussion on
                what we will and won't support on SoylentNews going forward, and
                this seems as good of place as any to get the ball rolling.

                    Art can have a positive effect on our mood. But does this
                    also work when we look at paintings on a screen? An
                    international research team involving the University of
                    Vienna, the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in
                    Nijmegen and the Max Planck Institute for Empirical
                    Aesthetics (MPIEA) in Frankfurt am Main decided to
                    investigate this question. The study was funded by the EU
                    Horizon
                    <a href="https://artis-h2020.eu/">ART*IS Project</a>. The
                    results have now been published as an open access article in
                    the journal
                    <a

                    240 study participants viewed an interactive Monet Water
                    Lily art exhibition from Google Arts and Culture. By filling
                    out a questionnaire, they provided information about their
                    state of mind, how much pleasure they felt when looking at
                    the pictures, and how meaningful they considered the
                    experience to be. The results showed significant
                    improvements in mood and anxiety after just a few minutes of
                    viewing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study also found that some participants were more
                    receptive to art than others and were able to benefit more.
                    This advantage could be predicted using a metric called
                    "aesthetic responsiveness."

                    Google is testing how it can stop users from watching
                    ad-free videos as ad revenue declines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As first spotted by BleepingComputer, a Reddit user posted a
                    screenshot to the r/youtube subreddit showing the message
                    "Video player will be blocked after 3 videos."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The message further states that YouTube detected the user
                    had an ad blocker installed, and then offered the option to
                    either allow YouTube ads or try YouTube Premium, the $11.99
                    ad-free subscription service. The service's family plan
                    recently saw a bump in price from $17.99 to $22.99 a month.
                    "Ads allow YouTube to stay free for billions of users
                    worldwide," the message reads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A YouTube spokesperson confirmed to Gizmodo that it was
                    running a "small experiment globally that urges viewers with
                    ad blockers enabled to allow ads on YouTube or try YouTube
                    Premium." The spokesperson added that "Ad blocker detection
                    is not new, and other publishers regularly ask viewers to
                    disable ad blockers."

                In 2019, two researchers from Harvard University – Amir Siraj
                and Avi Loeb, both of whom had published on 'Oumuamua and Comet
                Borisov earlier – also wrote a study of this meteor, suggesting
                its interstellar origins. If true, then this meteor – which
                predates both 'Oumuamua and Comet Borisov by a few years – would
                be the first known interstellar object.

                Deep-sea explorers found 50 spherules–molten droplets, about
                half a millimetre in diameter.
              </p>
              <p>
                Loeb's team collected 35 milligrams of this promising material
                by dragging a large magnetic sled across the surface of the
                ocean. The astrophysicist believes that the spherules are most
                likely made from a steel-titanium alloy
              </p>
              <p>
                "The spherules were found primarily along the most likely path
                of IM1 and not in control regions far from it," read his blog.
                "In the coming weeks, we will analyze their elemental and
                isotopic composition and report our data in a paper submitted to
                a peer-reviewed journal."

                These sub-millimeter-sized spheres, which appear under a
                microscope as beautiful metallic marbles, were concentrated
                along the expected path of IM1 — about 85 kilometers off the
                coast of Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.

                    It might seem that current malware and phishing protection
                    industry practices are not so different from the French
                    proposal. This is far from the truth, where the key
                    differentiating factor is that they do not block websites
                    but merely warn users about the risks and allow them to
                    access the websites if they choose to accept it. No such
                    language is present in the current proposal, which is
                    focused on blocking. Neither are there any references to
                    privacy preserving implementations or mechanisms to prevent
                    this feature from being utilized for other purposes. In
                    fact, a government being able to mandate that a certain
                    website not open at all on a browser/system is uncharted
                    territory and even the most repressive regimes in the world
                    prefer to block websites further up the network (ISPs, etc.)
                    so far.

                    A university janitor who turned off a freezer after hearing
                    multiple "annoying alarms," ruined more than 20 years of
                    research, according to a lawsuit filed against his employer
                    by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in upstate New York.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The lab's freezer contained over 20 years of research,
                    including cell cultures and samples, to which a "small
                    temperature fluctuation of three degrees would cause
                    catastrophic damage," according to the lawsuit filed with
                    the Rensselaer County Supreme Court.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The lawsuit states that cell cultures and specimens in
                    the freezer needed to be maintained at -80 degrees Celsius
                    and a small fluctuation of 3 degrees would cause damage, so
                    alarms would sound if the temperature increased to -78
                    degrees or decreased to -82 degrees.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    K.V. Lakshmi, a professor and director of the school's
                    Baruch '60 Center for Biochemical Solar Energy Research who
                    oversaw the research, noticed the freezer alert went off on
                    or around September 14, 2020, because its temperature had
                    risen to -78 degrees, according to the suit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite the alarm, Lakshmi and her team determined that the
                    cell samples would be safe until emergency repairs could be
                    done, the suit said. While Lakshmi waited for the freezer's
                    manufacturer to come perform repairs, her team added a
                    safety lock box around the freezer's outlet and socket. A
                    warning was posted on the freezer, according to the court
                    filing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But, on September 17, the janitor heard what he later
                    called "annoying alarms," according to the suit. In apparent
                    attempt to be helpful, he flipped the circuit breakers,
                    which provided electricity to the freezer, mistakenly
                    turning them from "on" to "off," according to the lawsuit.
                    It said the freezer's temperature rose to -32 degrees
                    Celsius.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The next day, research students found the freezer switched
                    off and despite attempts to preserve the research, a
                    majority of the cultures were "compromised, destroyed, and
                    rendered unsalvageable demolishing more than twenty years of
                    research," the lawsuit states.

              <p>
                The world of Linux has seen some disquiet over recent weeks
                following the decision of Red Hat to restrict source code
                distribution for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) to only their
                paying customers. We're sure that there will be plenty of
                fall-out to come from this news, but what can be done if your
                project relies upon access to those Red Hat sources?
              </p>
              <p>
                The Red-Hat-derived Rocky Linux distro relies on access to RHEL
                source, so the news could have been something of a disaster.
                Fortunately for Rocky users though, they appear to have found a
                reliable way to bypass the restriction and retain access to
                those RHEL sources. Red Hat would like anyone wanting source
                access to pay them handsomely for the privilege, but the Rocky
                folks have spotted a way to bypass this. Using readily available
                cloud images they can spin up a RHEL system and use it to
                download their sources, and they can do this as an automated
                process.
              </p>
              <p>
                We covered this story as it unfolded last week, and it seemed
                inevitable then that something of this nature would be found, as
                for all Red Hat's wishes a GPL-licensed piece of code can't be
                prevented from being shared. So Rocky users and the wider
                community will for now retain access to the code, but will Red
                Hat strike back? It's inevitable that there will be a further
                backlash from the community against any such moves, but will Red
                Hat be foolhardy enough to further damage their standing in this
                regard?

                    this all starts with tackling child abuse and terrorists –
                    something with which the population won't generally have a
                    problem – but will later lead to broader surveillance and
                    censorship. It smacks of a government fed up with not being
                    able to peer into private chatter whenever it feels

                    To be fair, FPGAs can be (and often are) paired with quantum
                    computing elements - they're usually deployed in quantum
                    control mechanisms, bridging the gap between standard
                    computing (like the one that's powering your current reading
                    experience) and quantum computing (and if you're reading
                    this in a quantum computer, do make sure to leave us a
                    note).

                    So the ARM development board could, perhaps, have been truly
                    used for quantum computing research at some point. Even so,
                    there's a difference between treading the quantum waters
                    with an FPGA dev board and actually manufacturing and
                    deploying devices such as Intel's own

                    The Intel i960 was a remarkable 32-bit processor of the
                    1990s with a confusing set of versions. Although it is now
                    mostly forgotten (outside the many people who used it as an
                    embedded processor), it has a complex history. It had a shot
                    at being Intel's flagship processor until x86 overshadowed
                    it. Later, it was the world's best-selling RISC processor.
                    One variant was a 33-bit processor with a decidedly non-RISC
                    object-oriented instruction set; it became a military
                    standard and was used in the F-22 fighter plane. Another
                    version powered Intel's short-lived Unix servers. In this
                    blog post, I'll take a look at the history of the i960,
                    explain its different variants, and examine silicon dies.
                    This chip has a lot of mythology and confusion (especially
                    on
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_i960"
                      >Wikipedia</a
                    >), so I'll try to clear things up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ancestry of the i960 starts in 1975, when Intel set out
                    to design a "micro-mainframe", a revolutionary processor
                    that would bring the power of mainframe computers to
                    microprocessors. This project, eventually called the iAPX
                    432, was a huge leap in features and complexity. Intel had
                    just released the popular 8080 processor in 1974, an 8-bit
                    processor that kicked off the hobbyist computer era with
                    computers such as the Altair and IMSAI. However, 8-bit
                    microprocessors were toys compared to 16-bit minicomputers
                    like the PDP-11, let alone mainframes like the 32-bit IBM
                    System/370. Most companies were gradually taking
                    minicomputer and mainframe features and putting them into
                    microprocessors, but Intel wanted to leapfrog to a
                    mainframe-class 32-bit processor. The processor would make
                    programmers much more productive by bridging the "semantic
                    gap" between high-level languages and simple processors,
                    implementing many features directly into the processor.

                    >
                    included memory management, process management, and
                    interprocess communication. These features were
                    traditionally part of the operating system, but Intel built
                    them in the processor, calling this the "<a
                      href="http://www.bitsavers.org/components/intel/iAPX_432/171821-001_Introduction_to_the_iAPX_432_Architecture_Aug81.pdf"
                      >Silicon Operating System</a
                    >". The processor was also one of the first to implement the
                    new IEEE 754 floating-point standard, still in use by most
                    processors. The 432 also had support for fault tolerance and
                    multi-processor systems. One of the most unusual features of
                    the 432 was that instructions weren't byte aligned. Instead,
                    instructions were between 6 and 321 bits long, and you could
                    jump into the middle of a byte. Another unusual feature was
                    that the 432 was a stack-based machine, pushing and popping
                    values on an in-memory stack, rather than using
                    general-purpose registers.

                    The investigators recruited these patients and performed
                    imaging every few years from 2010 to 2017, yielding an
                    average of 4.6 scans per participant over the course of the
                    study. The scans were used to measure thinning of the layer
                    of the nerve cells — known as ganglion cells — in the retina
                    over time. The average rate of deterioration was a loss of
                    0.32 micrometers of tissue per year in each patient.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, using blood samples from the patients to collect their
                    DNA, the researchers hunted for genetic mutations in those
                    people with the fastest deterioration rates and identified
                    23 such DNA variations that mapped to the complement gene
                    C3.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, to search for genes further linked to vision loss,
                    they performed an analysis of an existing clinical trial
                    group of another 835 people with MS, of whom 74% were women,
                    and whose average age was 40. Each participant underwent
                    periodic vision testing about every year to distinguish
                    their ability to detect contrast — finer and finer shades
                    that distinguish light versus dark. The test requires the
                    person to read five letters in a row as with a typical
                    vision chart test, as well as separate vison charts with
                    faint (low contrast) letters that simulate vision in low
                    light (dusk or dark).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using DNA from the blood samples of these 835 participants,
                    the researchers identified specific genetic changes in two
                    complement genes, C1QA and CR1, linked to those people with
                    the most rapidly declining ability to distinguish letters
                    with less contrast. Patients with genetic changes in the
                    C1QA gene were 71% more likely to develop difficulty
                    detecting visual contrast, whereas those with genetic
                    changes in the CR1 gene were at 40% increased risk for
                    developing a reduced ability to detect contrast.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These complement genes found to be linked with severity of
                    MS vision loss hold the genetic instructions for making
                    complement proteins.

                    The loss of communications was expected, because a hill
                    stood between Ingenuity and Perseverance, which acts as a
                    relay between the drone and Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Ingenuity is designed to take care of itself when
                    communication gaps like this occur, but we all still had a
                    sense of relief finally hearing back."

                  <p>
                    Data so far indicates that the heli is in good shape. If
                    further health checks also come back normal, Ingenuity will
                    be all set for its next flight, westward toward a rocky
                    outcrop the Perseverance team is interested in exploring.

                    A new framework developed by University of Waterloo
                    researchers demonstrates the significant economic health
                    savings and benefits from urban park investments.
                  </p>

                    In the first case study of its kind in Canada, researchers
                    looked at Peterborough's new

                    park, which cost taxpayers $6.4 million, and have estimated
                    the economic value of physical and mental health benefits
                    that could come from it at more than $4 million per year.
                    The framework considers the health savings associated with
                    improved mental health and better air quality, the avoided
                    economic burden of physical inactivity and higher life
                    satisfaction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study demonstrates the value of developing and enhancing
                    urban parks as a strategy to improve population health and
                    well-being, and as a means of cost savings to the medical
                    system.

                  <p>
                    "Investments in urban parks are among the soundest financial
                    decisions a community can make," said Jeffrey Wilson,
                    professor in the School of Environment, Enterprise and
                    Development. "When you consider the population health
                    benefits, the value of lessening climate-related impacts and
                    the role of parks to support economic development, we see
                    how parks provide a large payback."

                    A drone flies over a peaceful Southern California marsh and
                    unleashes a rain of larvae-killing bacterial spore pellets.
                    Its target: a surging population of mosquitoes that can
                    spread

                    to humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The drone is the latest technology deployed by the Orange
                    County Mosquito and Vector Control District to attack
                    mosquito development in marshes, large ponds and parks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Common methods of applying anti-mosquito treatments
                    involve use of backpack sprayers, trucks, airplanes and
                    helicopters. The drone allows more precise treatments and
                    avoids the need to trample through sensitive lands,
                    according to the district.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The drone is flown higher than all nesting birds and
                    allows access to places that can't be reached by a person
                    with a backpack sprayer or trucks, Nguyen said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nguyen said the drone is able to treat 1 acre (0.4 hectares)
                    of land in under two minutes, a task that would take more
                    than an hour of hiking by a worker with a backpack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The anti-mosquito treatment is not harmful to other
                    wildlife.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The mosquito larvae are filter feeders, so they feed on the
                    bacteria," Savage said. "It enters their gut and it's a
                    growth regulator. So essentially—if you guys have seen the
                    movie 'Alien'—it blows their stomach out."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] So far this year, West Nile has not been detected in
                    the Orange County district but Nguyen is nowhere near
                    declaring victory over the pests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's more of a battle," he said. "You're not going to win
                    the war against mosquitoes, but you can gain some ground.
                    And with advancements in technology, we're gaining ground."

                    It's summer, and that means health organizations will be
                    periodically showering Americans with reminders of how
                    public swimming venues are actually nightmarish cesspits
                    teeming with microbes that can burn your eyes, ravage your

                    In attempts to communicate some pretty basic health
                    advice—like, don't pee or poop in a public pool and try to
                    avoid gulping toxic algae from lakes—health organizations
                    create a mesmerizing fountain of hilarious, graphic,
                    disturbing, clumsy, and sometimes perplexing advisories.

                    Given this wellspring of vomitus summer fun, here are our
                    picks for the top five public health advisories bobbing in
                    the waters this summer.<br />[...]<br />3. The dipstick test

                    If swimming pools suddenly seem too confining and
                    ill-equipped to handle the loaded loads we're plunging,
                    maybe a swim in a nice, big, natural lake sounds nice this
                    summer? Think again.

                    The Wisconsin Department of Health Services wants to ensure
                    you don't swim in any toxin-toting blooms of blue-green
                    algae. In helpful, picture-based tips, the department
                    advises against swimming in water that looks like green pea
                    soup or green latex paint—in case any of those options
                    seemed enticing. Dead fish and "floating scum, globs, or
                    mats" are also (apparently not obvious) signs to stay away.

                    on the AIGameDev subreddit, potterharry97 wrote that the
                    initial submission was intended as an early placeholder
                    version, "with 2-3 assets/sprites that were admittedly
                    obviously AI generated from the hands."<br />[...]<br />These
                    days, the use of AI-generated art can sometimes be easier to
                    catch, as was the case with potterharry97's Stable Diffusion
                    sprites and their telltale hands. But that might get tougher
                    as

                    if something was or wasn't AI generated?"

                Women hunt in vast majority of foraging societies, upending old

                    For decades anthropologists have witnessed forager
                    women—those who live in societies that both hunt and
                    gather—around the world skillfully slay prey: In the 1980s,
                    Agta women of the Philippines drew bows and arrows as tall
                    as themselves and aimed at wild pigs and deer, and Matses
                    Amazonians struck paca rodents with machetes. Observations
                    from the 1990s described Aka great-grandmothers and girls as
                    young as age 5 trapping duiker and porcupine in central
                    Africa.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A study published today in PLOS ONE has united these reports
                    for a first-of-its-kind global view of women hunters.
                    Reviewing accounts penned by scholars who study culture,
                    known as ethnographers, as well as those by observers
                    between the late 1800s and today, the researchers found that
                    women hunted in nearly 80% of surveyed forager societies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These data flatly reject a long-standing myth that men hunt,
                    women gather, and that this division runs deep in human
                    history.

                    Ultimately, the scam routed $23 million in royalty proceeds
                    away from mostly Latin artists and into the bank accounts of
                    Teran and his co-conspirators.

                    Teran, the sentencing memo said, "obtained more than $6
                    million in personal profits" and continued pocketing
                    $190,000 in stolen royalties—which he hid from
                    officials—even after he was indicted for the fraud. Partly
                    because of this, Teran is considered a "high-risk to

                    Teran could attempt to run the scam or something like it
                    again, Restaino wrote. The US government considers Teran at
                    high risk to re-offend, partly because just 12 days after
                    being summoned for his indictment, he promptly created a new
                    bank account to stash additional stolen payments sent from

                    From visible starlight to radio waves, the Milky Way galaxy
                    has long been observed through the various frequencies of
                    electromagnetic radiation it emits. Scientists have now
                    revealed a uniquely different image of our galaxy by
                    determining the galactic origin of thousands of neutrinos —
                    invisible "ghost particles" which exist in great quantities
                    but normally pass straight through Earth undetected. The
                    neutrino-based image of the Milky Way is the first of its
                    kind: a galactic portrait made with particles of matter
                    rather than electromagnetic energy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The breakthrough was achieved by a collaboration of
                    researchers using the U.S. National Science
                    Foundation-supported IceCube Neutrino Observatory at NSF's
                    Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica. The immense
                    observatory detects the subtle signs of high-energy
                    neutrinos from space by using thousands of networked sensors
                    buried deep within a cubic kilometer of clear, pristine ice.
                    The results were revealed at an event at Drexel University
                    and published in the journal
                    <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adc9818"

                    [...] "As is so often the case, significant breakthroughs in
                    science are enabled by advances in technology," says Denise
                    Caldwell, director of NSF's Physics Division. "The
                    capabilities provided by the highly sensitive IceCube
                    detector, coupled with new data analysis tools, have given
                    us an entirely new view of our galaxy — one that had only
                    been hinted at before. As these capabilities continue to be
                    refined, we can look forward to watching this picture emerge
                    with ever-increasing resolution, potentially revealing
                    hidden features of our galaxy never before seen by
                    humanity."

                  <p>
                    "What's intriguing is that, unlike the case for light of any
                    wavelength, in neutrinos, the universe outshines the nearby
                    sources in our own galaxy," says Francis Halzen, a physicist
                    at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and principal
                    investigator at IceCube.

                    [...] Over many decades, scientists have revealed countless
                    astronomical discoveries by expanding the methods used to
                    observe the universe. Once-revolutionary advances such as
                    radio astronomy and infrared astronomy have been joined by a
                    new class of observational techniques using phenomena such
                    as gravitational waves and now, neutrinos. Kurahashi Neilson
                    says that the neutrino-based image of the Milky Way is yet
                    another step in that lineage of discovery. She predicts
                    neutrino astronomy will be honed like the methods that
                    preceded it, until it too can reveal previously unknown
                    aspects of the universe.

                    "This is why we do what we do," she says. "To see something
                    nobody has ever seen, and to understand things we haven't
                    understood."

                    As early as the 1990s, however, it was clear that a new
                    light source with a smaller wavelength would be needed to
                    continue manufacturing ever-smaller transistors. Intel,
                    America's biggest chipmaker, led the early investments into
                    extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, using a type of light
                    with a wavelength of 13.5 nanometers. This was sufficiently
                    exact to pattern shapes with roughly equivalent dimensions.
                    But only one of the world's remaining lithography companies,
                    ASML, had the guts to bet its future on the technology,
                    which would take three decades and billions of dollars to
                    develop. For a long time, many industry experts thought it
                    would never work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Producing EUV light at sufficient scale is one of the most
                    complex engineering challenges in human history. ASML's
                    approach requires taking a ball of tin 30 microns wide and
                    pulverizing it twice with an ultra-high-powered carbon
                    dioxide laser. This explodes the tin ball into a plasma with

                    plasma emits EUV light, which then must be collected with
                    the flattest mirrors ever created, each made of dozens of
                    alternating, nanometers-thick layers of silicon and
                    molybdenum. These mirrors are held almost perfectly still by
                    a set of actuators and sensors that, their manufacturer
                    says, are so precise they could be used to direct a laser to

                    [...] The fact that the computing capabilities of the
                    world's second-largest economy depend on access to a single
                    tool produced by a single company illustrates the central
                    role lithography plays in the world's tech sector. The
                    industry is extraordinarily complex—the result of intensive
                    research efforts by a worldwide network of experts on optics
                    and materials science, plus billions of dollars of
                    investment. China's homegrown lithography tools are several
                    generations behind the cutting edge, lacking many of the key
                    components—like the ultra-flat mirrors—as well as the
                    expertise in systems integration.

                    The lithography process he invented, meanwhile, continues to
                    advance. In several years, ASML will release a new version
                    of its EUV technology, called high-numerical-­aperture EUV,
                    which will allow even more precise lithography. Research
                    into a future tool with even more precision is underway,
                    though it is unclear if it will ever be practically or
                    commercially feasible. We must hope it is, because the
                    future of Moore's Law—and the advances in computing it
                    enables—depend on it.

                    [...] The findings from one of the experiments — which
                    involved several researchers, including Koch and Chalmers —
                    were revealed on Friday at the ASSC meeting. It tested two
                    of the leading hypotheses: integrated information theory
                    (IIT) and global network workspace theory (GNWT). IIT
                    proposes that consciousness is a 'structure' in the brain
                    formed by a specific type of neuronal connectivity that is
                    active for as long as a certain experience, such as looking
                    at an image, is occurring. This structure is thought to be
                    found in the posterior cortex, at the back of the brain.
                    GNWT, by contrast, suggests that consciousness arises when
                    information is broadcast to areas of the brain through an
                    interconnected network. The transmission, according to the
                    theory, happens at the beginning and end of an experience
                    and involves the prefrontal cortex, at the front of the
                    brain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Six independent laboratories conducted the adversarial
                    experiment, following a preregistered protocol and using
                    various complementary methods to measure brain activity. The
                    results — which haven't yet been peer reviewed — didn't
                    perfectly match either of the theories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As for the bet, Koch was reluctant to admit defeat
                    but, the day before the ASSC session, he bought a case of
                    fine Portuguese wine to honour his commitment. Would he
                    consider another wager? "I'd double down," he says.
                    "Twenty-five years from now is realistic, because the
                    techniques are getting better and, you know, I can't wait
                    much longer than 25 years, given my age."
