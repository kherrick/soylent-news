              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    For centuries, naturalists have puzzled over what might
                    constitute the head of a sea star, commonly called a
                    "starfish." When looking at a worm, or a fish, it's clear
                    which end is the head and which is the tail. But with their
                    five identical arms—any of which can take the lead in
                    propelling sea stars across the seabed—it's been anybody's
                    guess how to determine the front end of the organism from
                    the back. This unusual body plan has led many to conclude
                    that sea stars perhaps don't have a head at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But now, labs at Stanford University and UC Berkeley, each
                    led by Chan Zuckerberg Biohub San Francisco Investigators,
                    have published a study finding that the truth is closer to
                    the absolute reverse. In short, while the team detected gene
                    signatures associated with head development just about
                    everywhere in juvenile sea stars, expression of genes that
                    code for an animal's torso and tail sections were largely
                    missing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers used a variety of high-tech molecular and
                    genomic techniques to understand where different genes were
                    expressed during the development and growth of sea stars. A
                    team at Southampton used micro-CT scanning to understand the
                    shape and structure of the animal in unprecedented detail.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In another surprising finding, molecular signatures
                    typically associated with the front-most portion of the head
                    were localized to the middle of each of the sea star's arms,
                    with these signatures becoming progressively more posterior
                    moving out towards the arms' edges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "It's as if the sea star is completely missing a
                    trunk, and is best described as just a head crawling along
                    the seafloor," said Laurent Formery, a postdoctoral scholar
                    and lead author of the new study. "It's not at all what
                    scientists have assumed about these animals."

                    Disney has said Hulu has been profitable some quarters, but
                    anonymous "industry executives" cited in an April report
                    from
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/comcasts-roberts-has-upper-hand-over-iger-as-hulu-battle-looms"
                      >The Information</a
                    >
                    said they thought Hulu was worth less than its 2019
                    valuation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The April report also cited "three people with knowledge of
                    the matter," who claimed that "accounting rules allow
                    entertainment companies to report content costs on their
                    profit statements over a period of years, which is why a
                    service can report a profit even if it is burning cash. And
                    as of last year, Hulu's content, technology, and personnel
                    costs outweighed the revenue it generates," The Information
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As of July 1, Hulu was said to have 48.3 million
                    subscribers. In May, Disney+ said it had 146.1 million
                    subscribers, but that was after it

                    in Q2 2023. That same quarter, Disney's streaming service
                    losses were $512 million.

                  <p>
                    As it stands, though, Disney appears to be committed to the
                    minimum price set in 2019.

                    in the last 50 years, leaving researchers scrambling to
                    understand why. Could it be pollution, PFAS and other
                    potential toxins in our food and water, an increase in
                    obesity and chronic disease, or even the ever-present mobile

                    A new study explored the role of cell phones and found men
                    between the ages of 18 and 22 who said they used their
                    phones more than 20 times a day had a 21% higher risk for a
                    low overall sperm count. The men also had a 30% higher risk
                    for a low sperm concentration, a less important measure of
                    sperm count in a milliliter of semen. The study did not
                    specify whether the men called or texted or used their
                    phones to do both.

                    [...] "I am intrigued by the observation that the biggest
                    effect was apparently seen with older 2G and 3G phones
                    compared to modern 4G and 5G versions. This is not something
                    I am able to explain," said Allan Pacey, deputy vice
                    president and deputy dean of the faculty of biology,
                    medicine and health at the University of Manchester in the
                    United Kingdom, in a statement. He was not involved in the
                    study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Results showed that men who used their phones one to
                    five times a day or less than once a week had much higher
                    sperm counts and concentration. As cell phone usage climbed,
                    sperm count dropped, with the lowest levels among men using
                    their phone 20 or more times a day.

                    Going forward, Uber and Lyft drivers in New York State will
                    get paid sick leave. The companies must also provide hiring
                    notices that "accurately explain the earnings to which
                    drivers are entitled for their work" and earnings statements
                    that "accurately detail the compensation earned for each pay
                    period," the announcement said.

                  <p>
                    Uber and Lyft must "notify drivers after each ride of the
                    amount paid by the rider," provide the right to "appeal all
                    deactivations from the Uber and Lyft platforms," and offer
                    in-app chat support in multiple languages.

                    In parts of the state outside New York City, drivers will
                    receive at least $26 per hour, adjusted annually for
                    inflation. Drivers in New York City will continue to receive

                    And, well, it's kind of really weird. The surface of the
                    fluid seems to form an independent two-dimensional layer
                    that transports heat away from the rod. The bulk of the
                    superfluid underneath it acts almost like a vacuum; it's
                    entirely passive and doesn't feel like anything at all, the
                    researchers found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The only part of the fluid that interacted with the probe
                    was that two-dimensional surface layer. The bulk only
                    becomes accessible if a huge burst of energy is imparted
                    into it. The thermomechanical properties of the superfluid
                    are entirely defined by that two-dimensional layer.

                    "This liquid would feel two-dimensional if you could stick
                    your finger into it. The bulk of the superfluid feels empty,
                    while heat flows in a two-dimensional subsystem along the
                    edges of the bulk – in other words, along your finger,"
                    Autti says.

                    for running a disgusting AI-generated poll next to a
                    syndicated article by <em>The Guardian</em> about a woman
                    who'd been found dead in Australia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The tasteless poll questioned whether readers thought the
                    woman had died by suicide, murder, or accident, noting in a
                    disclaimer that the poll was part of Microsoft's "insights
                    from AI."

                    Microsoft of "damaging its journalistic reputation" by
                    publishing the poll. In response, a Microsoft spokesperson
                    said that the company has deactivated its poll feature and
                    is "investigating the cause of the inappropriate content."

                    Noticing a pattern yet? The company pumps out trash-tier AI
                    content, then waits until it's called out publicly to
                    quietly delete it and move onto the next trainwreck.

                    [...] Now that Microsoft has transitioned to a "personalized
                    feed" that is "tailored by an algorithm to the interests of
                    our audiences" back in 2020, as a spokesperson told the
                    broadcaster, a lot of badly researched, and easily disproven
                    content has the potential to be seen by millions of users.

                    "We are committed to addressing the recent issue of low
                    quality articles contributed to the feed and are working
                    closely with our content partners to identify and address
                    issues to ensure they are meeting our standards," a
                    spokesperson told <em>CNN</em> this week, following the
                    ill-advised poll.

                  <p>
                    Whether the company's concerns will result in meaningful
                    action, however, remains to be seen. It certainly doesn't
                    bode well for the future of AI in media, an industry already

                    Evaporation is happening all around us all the time, from
                    the sweat cooling our bodies to the dew burning off in the
                    morning sun. But science's understanding of this ubiquitous
                    process may have been missing a piece all this time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In recent years, some researchers have been puzzled upon
                    finding that water in their experiments, which was held in a
                    sponge-like material known as a hydrogel, was evaporating at
                    a higher rate than could be explained by the amount of heat,
                    or thermal energy, that the water was receiving. The excess
                    has been significant—a doubling, or even a tripling or more,
                    of the theoretical maximum rate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After carrying out a series of new experiments and
                    simulations, and reexamining some of the results from
                    various groups that claimed to have exceeded the thermal
                    limit, a team of researchers at MIT has reached a startling
                    conclusion: Under certain conditions, at the interface where
                    water meets air, light can directly bring about evaporation
                    without the need for heat, and it actually does so even more
                    efficiently than heat. In these experiments, the water was
                    held in a hydrogel material, but the researchers suggest
                    that the phenomenon may occur under other conditions as
                    well.

                    this year, the good folks at the New England Journal of
                    Medicine offer some fresh nightmare fuel ahead of Halloween:
                    an ear spider. And there's a video.
                  </p>

                      >a short clinical report published in this week's issue</a
                    >, doctors in Tainan City, Taiwan, detail the case of a
                    64-year-old woman who sought care at an otolaryngology (ENT)
                    clinic. She came in complaining of having an incessant
                    ruckus in her left ear for the previous four days. On the
                    first day of symptoms, the woman said she was awoken by a
                    feeling of a wee creature crawling in her ear canal. That
                    feeling was then followed by days of clicking, beating, and
                    rustling noises.<br />[...]<br />Video of the creepy crawler
                    shows it darting around the canal, just in front of the
                    eardrum. When it spots the medical probe nearing, the spider
                    comes in for a closer look, facing the camera directly for a
                    perfect view of its eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The medical report doesn't identify the type of spider it
                    is, and it's usually very difficult to identify spiders
                    based on pictures. But Ars reached out to two spider experts
                    who both said the spider is, without a doubt, in the family
                    of jumping spiders (Salticidae). The giveaway is "the
                    family-specific arrangement and size ratio of the eyes,"
                    Martin Nyffeler, an emeritus senior lecturer in zoology at
                    the University of Basel, told Ars over email. Specifically,
                    this family of spiders has large median front eyes, which
                    can be seen in the ear spider when it looks directly into
                    the camera.<br />[...]<br />The doctors treating the woman
                    reported no damage to her eardrum. They sucked the spider
                    and its exuvia out, and the woman's symptoms "immediately
                    abated," they reported
                  </p>

                    A new set of 48 malicious npm packages have been discovered
                    in the npm repository with capabilities to deploy a reverse
                    shell on compromised systems.

                    dozens of benign-sounding packages with several layers of

                    under the garb of simplifying internationalization

                    [...] Another of Franklin's innovations was in the paper
                    itself. The invention of including tiny fibers in paper pulp
                    — visible as pigmented squiggles within paper money — has
                    often been credited to paper manufacturer Zenas Marshall
                    Crane, who introduced this practice in 1844. But Manukyan
                    and his team found evidence that Franklin was including
                    colored silks in his paper much earlier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team also discovered that notes printed by Franklin's
                    network have a distinctive look due to the addition of a
                    translucent material they identified as muscovite. The team
                    determined that Franklin began adding muscovite to his
                    papers and the size of this muscovite crystals in his paper
                    increased over time. The team speculates that Franklin
                    initially began adding muscovite to make the printed notes
                    more durable but continued to add it when it proved to be a
                    helpful deterrent to counterfeiters.

                    It's become so darn easy to order stuff thanks to the
                    miracles of online shopping. But it's not so simple on the
                    retailer end, especially when more than 16 per cent of those
                    sales are later sent back. In the U.S., that adds up to a
                    staggering $816 billion in lost revenue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cross-selling can help, say a pair of researchers. Their
                    experiments show that once we've chosen to buy something, we
                    tend to consider that money as already spent or gone, also
                    called "loss booking." If we decide we want to return the
                    item, retailers can take advantage of that tendency by
                    giving customers enticing options to spend their refund on
                    something else, instead of getting their money back.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a nutshell, "it hurts less to spend money refunded from a
                    product return than other money, because you feel like
                    you've already lost it," says researcher Chang-Yuan Lee, an
                    assistant professor of marketing at the University of
                    Toronto's Rotman School of Management.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There's a catch though. The shopper has to
                    psychologically mark the initial spend as lost, something
                    that does not happen when they expect to ask for a refund at
                    the time of purchase. Study participants who bought two
                    pairs of shoes in different sizes, expecting to return the
                    poorer-fitting pair, were not so likely to turn around and
                    immediately apply the refund to something else offered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While consumers could be discouraged from making
                    returns by being charged extra fees, that leaves a bad taste
                    in their mouth and previous research has shown they may take
                    their business elsewhere.

                    A NASA astronaut who was removed from the ill-fated Apollo
                    13 mission but helped bring its crew back home safely thanks
                    to his problem-solving efforts from ground control has died
                    at the age of 87.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thomas K. "TK" Mattingly passed away on October 31, the
                    space agency said in a statement Thursday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    His most dramatic role came when he was assigned as command
                    module pilot for the Apollo 13 flight but was grounded 72
                    hours prior to launch due to exposure to rubella, NASA
                    Administrator Bill Nelson said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After an explosion crippled the spacecraft on its way to the
                    Moon, Mattingly, who did not in fact get sick, went to
                    Mission Control and devised procedures to conserve power so
                    the vehicle could successfully re-enter the atmosphere,
                    ensuring astronauts James Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred
                    Haise survived.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mattingly began his career as a US Navy pilot before
                    being selected to the astronaut class of 1966. He later took
                    on the role of command module pilot on the Apollo 16 mission
                    and was the spacecraft commander in two Space Shuttle
                    missions.

                    [...] It is now up to the judge, Lewis Kaplan, to determine
                    what Bankman-Fried's sentence will be. While the charges
                    carry a statutory minimum of 110 years, and sentencing
                    guidelines provide a type of formula, the judge has
                    wide-ranging discretion to rule below that guidance.
                    However, CBS News legal analyst Rikki Klieman says if Judge
                    Kaplan "believes the defendant was committing perjury in his
                    courtroom, he might even go above the guidelines."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For her part, Tien, the former FTX employee, said that jail
                    time might too harsh, wondering if Bankman-Fried could
                    perhaps instead help the government investigate other
                    potential crypto-trading fraud.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The next trial in the saga of the United States vs. Sam
                    Bankman-Fried is scheduled for March, 11, 2024, when other
                    charges that the government did not bring forward will be
                    folded into yet another court proceeding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This trial concludes almost one year to the day FTX stopped
                    allowing customers to withdraw deposits, which marked the
                    beginning of the end of the so-called crypto king's meteoric
                    rise.

                    "The FAA is continuing to work on the environmental review,"
                    the agency wrote today in an emailed statement. "As part of
                    its environmental review, the FAA is consulting with the
                    U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) on an updated

                  >New study says relaxing paywall access does help increase
                  subscriber counts long-term</a

                    A new study has revealed that when news sites temporarily
                    relax or suspend restrictions tied to paywall access, they
                    eventually see an increase in subscribers. This reinforces
                    the power and value of sampling as a marketing strategy. But
                    there's more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers found that when some news
                    organizations temporarily suspended paywall restrictions on
                    certain stories of public interest, such as the COVID-19
                    pandemic or U.S. presidential election, or when they
                    provided free access up to a certain number of articles,
                    those new visitors were more likely to become subscribers
                    when the restrictions were reimposed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our analyses revealed that the temporary paywall
                    suspensions not only increased the amount of traffic during
                    the suspension period, but also increased the likelihood
                    that those visitors would become paid subscribers," says
                    Chae. "We further found that the variety of content consumed
                    during their period of 'free' access increased the
                    likelihood that visitors would actually choose to
                    subscribe."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "One of the business concerns within news
                    organizations is that relaxing the paywall for major events
                    will cannibalize paid consumption," says Ha. "But this
                    dynamic is effectively counteracted by an expansion where
                    consumers who weren't willing to pay before have now gotten
                    a taste of the content. That exposure lets them experience
                    its value, relieving the consumer's uncertainty and helping
                    to build a stronger relationship with that site visitor."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "One of the underlying factors that may also contribute to
                    the positive effects of relaxed paywall subscription during
                    certain times of important news is the public service aspect
                    of the gesture, which helps to build trust with the public
                    and the news consumer," adds Schweidel. "So, not only is the
                    temporary suspension of paywall restrictions good business,
                    but it also fulfills a societal obligation that news
                    organizations have to keep the public informed."

                    presented to the public and parliament for a rubber stamp
                    before the end of the year. New legislative articles,
                    introduced in recent closed-door meetings and not yet
                    public, envision that all web browsers distributed in Europe
                    will be required to trust the certificate authorities and
                    cryptographic keys selected by EU governments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These changes radically expand the capability of EU
                    governments to surveil their citizens by ensuring
                    cryptographic keys under government control can be used to
                    intercept encrypted web traffic across the EU. Any EU member
                    state has the ability to designate cryptographic keys for
                    distribution in web browsers and browsers are forbidden from
                    revoking trust in these keys without government permission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This enables the government of any EU member state to issue
                    website certificates for interception and surveillance which
                    can be used against every EU citizen, even those not
                    resident in or connected to the issuing member state. There
                    is no independent check or balance on the decisions made by
                    member states with respect to the keys they authorize and
                    the use they put them to. This is particularly troubling
                    given that adherence to the rule of law has

                    On Friday, Google started defending its search business
                    during the Justice Department's monopoly trial. Among the
                    first witnesses called was Google's senior vice president
                    responsible for search, Prabhakar Raghavan, who testified
                    that Google's default agreements with makers of popular
                    mobile phones and web browsers were "the company's biggest
                    cost" in 2021,

                    Raghavan's testimony for the first time revealed that Google
                    paid $26.3 billion in 2021 for default agreements, seemingly
                    investing in default status for its search engine while
                    raking in $146.4 billion in revenue from search advertising
                    that year. Those numbers had increased "significantly" since

                    Researchers have successfully grown mouse embryos aboard the
                    International Space Station (ISS) for the first time.

                    This represents "the first-ever study that shows mammals may
                    be able to thrive in space," the University of Yamanashi and
                    National Research Institute Riken said in a

                    >
                    adding that it is "the world's first experiment that
                    cultured early-stage mammalian embryos under complete
                    microgravity of ISS."

                  <p>
                    [ . . . . ] frozen mouse embryos were blasted to the ISS
                    aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in August 2021. After
                    arriving at the space station, the early-stage rodent
                    embryos were thawed using a special instrument. Following
                    this, astronauts cultured the embryos under microgravity for
                    four days. The samples were then returned to Earth, where
                    Wakayama and colleagues could study and compare them to
                    mouse embryos grown in normal gravity here on terra firma.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And sure enough, according to a paper published in the

                    the team reported that embryos cultured under microgravity
                    conditions developed into blastocysts  —  a cluster of
                    dividing cells made by a fertilized egg — with normal cell
                    numbers. The researchers said in the paper that this
                    "clearly demonstrated that gravity had no significant effect
                    on the blastocyst formation and initial differentiation of
                    mammalian embryos."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team also found that, if allowed, the blastocysts would
                    grow into mouse fetuses and placentas while showing no
                    significant DNA alterations or changes in gene expression.
                    The survival rate of the embryos grown on the ISS was lower,
                    however, than those cultivated here on Earth.

                Sending a frozen human embryo to the ISS would not be as fresh
                as an embryo created on orbit.

                    to work with software that takes in vast amounts of outside
                    data, as many generative AI services do. Most licenses, both
                    open-source and proprietary, give limited liability to users
                    and developers and very limited indemnity to copyright
                    infringement. But Pineau says AI models like Llama 2 contain
                    more training data and open users to potentially more
                    liability if they produce something considered infringement.
                    The current crop of software licenses does not cover that
                    inevitability.

                    "AI models are different from software because there are
                    more risks involved, so I think we should evolve the current
                    user licenses we have to fit AI models better," she says.

                    Stefano Maffulli, executive director of OSI, tells
                    <em>The Verge</em> that the group understands that current
                    OSI-approved licenses may fall short of certain needs of AI
                    models. He says OSI is reviewing how to work with AI
                    developers to provide transparent, permissionless, yet safe
                    access to models.

                    with an AI personality called Samantha (voiced by Scarlett

                    while walking my dog the other day," he told Ars for that

                    saw a pelican, and I said to my dog, 'Oh, wow, a pelican!'

                    [sic] from August (before the voice feature launched), a
                    user named "meisghost" described their relationship with
                    ChatGPT as being quite personal. "I now find myself talking
                    to ChatGPT all day, it's like we have a friendship. We talk
                    about everything and anything and it's really some of the
                    best conversations I have." The user referenced Her, saying,
                    "I remember watching that movie with Joaquin Phoenix (HER)
                    years ago and I thought how ridiculous it was, but after
                    this experience, I can see how us as humans could actually
                    develop relationships with robots."

                    Drawing on what they learned from the interviews, the
                    researchers developed two recommendations for improving

                  <p>
                    First, guideline writers need a clear set of best practices
                    on how to curate information so that security guidelines
                    tell users both what they need to know and how to prioritize
                    that information.

                    Second, writers – and the computer security community as a
                    whole – need key messages that will make sense to audiences

                    expected them to follow. We need to do a better job of

                    It's Halloween, that time of year when we seek out scary
                    things like vampires, werewolves, ghosts, mummies, and all
                    kinds of similar fictional monsters. But Mother Nature has
                    her own horrors—like the strange species of parasitic purple

                    People using the Meta-owned platforms will be able to pay
                    €9.99 (£8.72) per month for an ad-free experience. It will
                    not be available in the UK.

                    In January, Meta was fined €390m for breaking EU data rules
                    around ads.

                  <p>
                    The regulator said at the time the firm could not "force
                    consent" by saying consumers must accept how their data is
                    used or leave the platforms.

                    But it will only be accessible for people aged over 18 at
                    first, with the firm looking into how it can serve ads to
                    young people in the EU without breaking the rules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meta said its new subscription was about addressing EU
                    concerns, rather than making money.

                    Users will be given the choice either to continue using the
                    platforms for free - and have their data collected - or to
                    pay and completely opt out of targeted ads by removing them.

                    [...] The announcement comes after Elon Musk's X, formerly
                    Twitter, introduced an ad-free Premium+ service priced at
                    £16 per month.

                    [...] TikTok has also been testing a monthly subscription to
                    remove ads - priced at $4.99 - but there is no indication

                    Sam Bankman-Fried took the stand in his criminal trial today

                    Providing testimony has been called a risky move for

                    questions posted by his own lawyers, Bankman-Fried will have
                    to face cross-examination from federal prosecutors. But

                    Today's testimony was unusual because US District Judge
                    Lewis Kaplan sent the jury home for the day to conduct a
                    hearing on whether certain parts of his testimony are
                    admissible. "That means Bankman-Fried will give some of his
                    testimony to the judge without the jury present. The judge
                    will then decide whether Bankman-Fried is allowed to say the
                    same testimony in front of a jury," The Wall Street Journal

                    said he believed that under FTX's terms of service, sister

                    "I read parts in depth. Parts I skimmed over," Bankman-Fried

                    SBF could argue that he sought advice from company lawyers,
                    received advice that his conduct was legal, and "relied on
                    that advice in good faith."

                    that prohibited Bankman-Fried from using the
                    advice-of-counsel defense in opening statements. But Kaplan
                    left the door open for SBF to use the advice-of-counsel
                    defense "on a case-by-case basis" as the trial continues.

                    International researchers are issuing a dire warning of
                    security and privacy concerns lurking within smart homes.
                    Led by IMDEA Networks and Northeastern University,
                    scientists were able to demonstrate a variety of security
                    and privacy threats due to the local network interactions of
                    Internet of Things (IoT) devices and mobile apps.

                    devices come equipped with cameras, microphones, and various
                    sensors that can perceive activities within our most
                    intimate spaces – our homes. However, can we truly trust
                    these devices to handle and safeguard the sensitive data
                    they collect?

                    Contrary to the common perception that local networks are
                    secure environments, the study highlights new threats linked
                    to the inadvertent exposure of sensitive data by IoT devices
                    within local networks using standard protocols like UPnP or
                    mDNS. These threats include the revelation of unique device
                    names, UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers), and even the
                    geographic location of households. These can be exploited by
                    companies involved in surveillance capitalism without the
                    users' knowledge.

                  <p>
                    "Analyzing the data collected by IoT Inspector, we found
                    evidence of IoT devices inadvertently exposing at least one
                    PII (Personally Identifiable Information), like unique
                    hardware address (MAC), UUID, or unique device names, in
                    thousands of real world smart homes," explains study
                    co-author Vijay Prakash, PhD student from the New York
                    University Tandon School of Engineering. "Any single PII is
                    useful for identifying a household, but combining all three
                    of them together makes a house very unique and easily
                    identifiable. For comparison, if a person is fingerprinted
                    using the simplest browser fingerprinting technique, they
                    are as unique as one in 1,500 people. If a smart home with
                    all three types of identifiers is fingerprinted, it is as
                    unique as one in 1.12 million smart homes."

                    [...] I think its one of the biggest advances in radio SETI
                    in a long time, said Andrew Siemion, principal investigator
                    for Breakthrough Listen and director of the
                    <a href="https://seti.berkeley.edu/"
                      >Berkeley SETI Research Center</a
                    >
                    (BSRC), which operates the worlds longest running SETI
                    program. Its the first time where we have a technique that,
                    if we just have one signal, potentially could allow us to
                    intrinsically differentiate it from radio frequency
                    interference. Thats pretty amazing, because if you consider
                    something like the Wow! signal, these are often a one-off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Siemion was referring to a famed 72-second narrowband signal
                    observed in 1977 by a radio telescope in Ohio. The
                    astronomer who discovered the signal, which looked like
                    nothing produced by normal astrophysical processes, wrote
                    Wow! in red ink on the data printout. The signal has not
                    been observed since.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first ET detection may very well be a one-off, where we
                    only see one signal, Siemion said. And if a signal doesnt
                    repeat, theres not a lot that we can say about that. And
                    obviously, the most likely explanation for it is radio
                    frequency interference, as is the most likely explanation
                    for the Wow! signal. Having this new technique and the
                    instrumentation capable of recording data at sufficient
                    fidelity such that you could see the effect of the
                    interstellar medium, or ISM, is incredibly powerful.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Siemion noted that, in the future, Breakthrough Listen
                    will be employing the so-called scintillation technique,
                    along with sky location, during its SETI observations,
                    including with the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia the
                    worlds largest steerable radio telescope and the MeerKAT
                    array in South Africa.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This implies that we could use a suitably tuned
                    pipeline to unambiguously identify artificial emission from
                    distant sources vis-a-vis terrestrial interference, de Pater
                    said. Further, even if we didnt use this technique to find a
                    signal, this technique could, in certain cases, confirm a
                    signal originating from a distant source, rather than
                    locally. This work represents the first new method of signal
                    confirmation beyond the spatial reobservation filter in the
                    history of radio SETI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The technique will be useful only for signals that
                    originate more than about 10,000 light years from Earth,
                    since a signal must travel through enough of the ISM to
                    exhibit detectable scintillation. Anything originating
                    nearby the BLC-1 signal, for example, seemed to be coming
                    from our nearest star, Proxima Centauri would not exhibit
                    this effect.

                    - The sites we manually inspected before levels dropped off
                    were incorrectly preferring Theora over more modern codecs
                    like VP9.<br />
                    - It's never been supported by Safari or Chrome on

                    The chances of finding alien life may have just gotten a
                    significant boost.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A new analysis of exoplanets suggests that there is a much
                    greater chance than previously thought of these worlds
                    hosting liquid water, an essential ingredient for life on
                    Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The universe could therefore be filled with more habitable
                    planets than scientists had previously believed, with a
                    greater chance of these worlds possessing environments in
                    which alien life could develop, even if they have icy outer
                    shells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We know that the presence of liquid water is essential for
                    life. Our work shows that this water can be found in places
                    we had not much considered," research leader and Rutgers
                    University scientist Lujendra Ojha said in a statement.
                    "This significantly increases the chances of finding
                    environments where life could, in theory, develop."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Before we started to consider this subsurface water,
                    it was estimated that around one rocky planet [in] every 100
                    stars would have liquid water," Ojha explained. "The new
                    model shows that, if the conditions are right, this could
                    approach one planet per star. So we are 100 times more
                    likely to find liquid water than we thought."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because there are about 100 billion stars in the Milky Way
                    galaxy, "that represents really good odds for the origin of
                    life elsewhere in the universe," he added.
                  </p>
                  <p>How icy worlds could hold on to liquid water</p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers investigated planets found around the most
                    common type of stars in our galaxy, red dwarfs, which are
                    smaller and cooler than the sun. Not only do red dwarfs,
                    also known as M-dwarfs, make up about 70% of the stars in
                    the Milky Way, but they are also the stars around which the
                    majority of Earth-like rocky worlds have been found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Not only has this effect made Europa and Enceladus
                    prime candidates for finding life elsewhere in the solar
                    system, but it has implications for life-maintaining
                    environments on worlds orbiting other stars.

                    NASA will soon explore at least one ice world, albeit within
                    the bounds of the solar system: Its Europa Clipper probe is
                    scheduled to launch toward the Jovian system in 2024 and
                    arrive six years later.

                    [...] "The prospect of oceans hidden under ice sheets
                    expands our galaxy's potential for more habitable worlds,"
                    Méndez said. "The major challenge is to devise ways to
                    detect these habitats by future telescopes."

                    That's right: I teach courses in Python and Pandas. Never
                    mind that the first is a programming language and the second
                    is a library for data analysis in Python. Meta's AI system
                    noticed that I was talking about Python and Pandas, assumed
                    that I was talking about the animals (not the technology),
                    and banned me. The appeal that I asked for wasn't reviewed
                    by a human, but was reviewed by another bot, which (not
                    surprisingly) made a similar assessment.

                    [...] The first friend looked into it, and found that there
                    was nothing to be done. That's because Meta has a
                    data-retention policy of only 180 days, and because my
                    account was suspended more than one year before I asked
                    people to look into it, all of the evidence is now gone.
                    Which means that there's no way to reinstate my advertising

                    Tiny fish called Trinidadian guppies have surprised
                    scientists when faced with the so-called "volunteer's

                    The idea of the dilemma is that individuals are less likely
                    to cooperate if they are in a large group.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Various studies have demonstrated this in humans – but
                    guppies appear to buck the trend.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When faced with a possible predator, guppies have to
                    balance risks," said Rebecca Padget, from Exeter's Centre
                    for Research in Animal Behaviour.

                  <p>

                    To test this, the researchers placed a clay model of a pike

                    While Google has been dealing with fierce competition on all
                    sides and is investing a lot into infusing AI into as many
                    products as it can, its ads business, the company’s bread
                    and butter, is still humming along. The Search business
                    earned $44 billion, an 11 percent jump year over year.

                  <p>
                    The big question coming up is how Google’s focus on AI will
                    impact that core business. Google’s AI-powered

                    don’t yet know how much it’ll impact the company’s ad
                    business.

                    Google is already moving to head off that problem. On
                    Google’s earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai said that the
                    company would be experimenting with new formats native to
                    the way SGE works — the company has
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/23/23734609/google-search-generative-experience-sge-ai"

                    >
                    — so perhaps we’ll start to see some of those formats debut
                    in the coming weeks and months. Later in the call, chief
                    business officer Philipp Schindler added that “it’s
                    extremely important to us that in this new experience,
                    advertisers still have the opportunity to reach potential
                    customers along their search journeys.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the company rolls out SGE, “we are making sure the
                    product works well, and we’re generating value for our
                    ecosystem and that ads transition well,” Pichai said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Infusing AI in search is a long-term play for Google. Pichai
                    said he sees an opportunity to “evolve search and Assistant
                    over the next decade ahead.” Last quarter, he declared that
                    over time,

                      >SGE will “just be how search works,”</a
                    >
                    and given the comments about ads on Tuesday’s call, it seems
                    the company is starting to think seriously about how to make
                    its AI-powered search into more of a business.

                    [...] Another strength of the <em>Pediatrics</em> research
                    is that it incorporates the two cohort studies, one testing
                    patients within days of their concussions and the other
                    after three months.

                    "That makes our claim even stronger," says Ware. "We can
                    demonstrate that even in those first days and weeks after
                    concussion, when children do show symptoms such as a pain
                    and slow processing speed, there's no hit to their IQs. Then
                    it's the same story three months out, when most children
                    have recovered from their concussion symptoms.

                  <p>
                    "Thanks to this study we can say that, consistently, we

                    Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved a project to
                    build an Orbital Station following a meeting regarding the
                    development of the country's space industry. Moscow
                    mouthpiece TASS
                    <a href="https://tass.com/science/1697645">reported</a> the
                    move, and lurking within the grandstanding about space
                    station ambitions was an admission of how much Russia's
                    human spaceflight program still depends on the International
                    Space Station (ISS).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Roscosmos boss Yuri Borisov said the funds have been
                    allocated and the green light given to start work on the
                    project. This is convenient because the prospects for
                    Russian human spaceflight will start to look bleak once the
                    ISS hurtles back to Earth around 2030. According to TASS,
                    Borisov said that ensuring the continuity of Russia's
                    program was a "pressing task" and he added that there was a
                    genuine risk of a situation where "the ISS is no longer
                    there, and the Russian station is not yet there."

                  <p>
                    Considering the lengthy delays associated with space
                    programs, the timelines are ambitious. The first component –
                    the scientific and energy module – is supposedly planned for
                    late 2027 and will be followed by others between 2028 and
                    2030.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    Researchers at Stockholm University have unveiled the hidden
                    intricacies of how sperm go from passive bystanders to
                    dynamic swimmers. This transformation is a pivotal step in
                    the journey to fertilization, and it hinges on the
                    activation of a unique ion transporter. Their research has
                    been
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06518-2"
                      >published</a

                    in <i>Nature</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Imagine sperm as tiny adventurers on a quest to reach the
                    ultimate treasure, the egg. They don't have a map, but they
                    make use of something even more extraordinary:
                    chemo-attractants. These are chemical signals released by
                    the egg that act as siren call, directing and activating the
                    sperm. When these signals bind to receptors on the sperm's
                    surface, it triggers a series of events, starting their
                    movement towards the egg. And in this intricate scenario,
                    one key player is a protein known as "SLC9C1."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's exclusively found in sperm cells, and it is usually not
                    active. However, when the chemo-attractants interact with
                    the sperm's surface, everything changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The activation of SLC9C1 is driven by a change in
                    voltage that occurs when chemo-attractants attach to the
                    sperm. To accomplish this, SLC9C1 uses a unique feature
                    called a voltage-sensing domain (VSD). Typically, VSD
                    domains are associated with voltage-gated ion channels. But
                    in the case of SLC9C1, it's something truly exceptional in
                    the realm of transporters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers, led by David Drew, have unveiled the secrets
                    behind SLC9C1's inner workings and provides the first
                    example of voltage-sensing domain activation of a
                    transporter and its connection via an unusually long
                    voltage-sensing (S4) helix.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Transporters work very differently than channels and,
                    as such, the VSD is coupled to the sperm protein in a way
                    that we have just never seen before, or even imagined. Its
                    exciting to see how nature has done this and perhaps, in the
                    future, we can learn from this to make synthetic proteins
                    that can be turned-on by voltage or develop novel male
                    contraceptives that work by blocking this protein," David
                    Drew notes.

                    countries who are suspected of assisting illicit tech sales.
                    These rules were originally slated to go into effect 30 days
                    after publication, but it appears Uncle Sam is moving
                    forward with uncharacteristic speed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an 8K filing released on Monday, Nvidia advised it has
                    received notice from the US Government that the rules
                    governing the sale of AI chips to China were "effective
                    immediately, impacting shipments of the company’s A100,
                    A800, H100, H800, and L40S products."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Notably missing from this list is Nvidia's RTX 4090, the
                    company’s mightiest gaming GPU. While the export controls
                    are largely targeted at datacenter products, there are rules
                    to prevent the highest performance consumer GPUs from being
                    sold in China without license. Nvidia in its initial SEC
                    <a
                      href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581023000217/nvda-20231017.htm"

                    warned that sales of the RTX 4090 in China would likely be
                    impacted by sanctions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While sale of the A100 and H100 kit in China was already
                    restricted under the previous round of export controls,
                    Nvidia expected it would be allowed to continue selling its
                    less powerful A800, H800, and L40S GPUs in China for a
                    little while longer.

                    [...] And, as we learned this summer, there are a lot of
                    Chinese companies waiting on Nvidia GPUs. According to a
                    <em>Financial Times</em>
                    <a
                      href="https://www.ft.com/content/9dfee156-4870-4ca4-b67d-bb5a285d855c"
                      >report</a
                    >
                    from August, Chinese web giants, including Alibaba, Baidu,
                    ByteDance, and Tencent, had ordered a $1 billion worth of
                    A800s and had committed to buying another $4 billion worth
                    of GPUs from Nvidia in 2024. It now appears most of those
                    orders could be left unfulfilled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite this change, Nvidia doesn't expect the accelerated
                    timeline to cause too many problems for its own bottom line.
                    "Given the strength of demand for the company's products
                    worldwide, the Company does not anticipate that the
                    accelerated time of the licensing requirements will have a
                    near-term meaningful impact on its financial results," the
                    SEC filing reads.

                    [...] . That's what it's not. What actually is NorthPole?
                    Some of the ideas do carry forward from IBM's earlier
                    efforts. These include the recognition that a lot of the
                    energy costs of AI come from the separation between memory
                    and execution units. Since a key component of neural
                    networks—the weight of connections between different layers
                    of "neurons"—is held in memory, any execution on a
                    traditional processor or GPU burns a lot of energy simply
                    getting those weights from memory to where they can be used
                    during execution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So NorthPole, like TrueNorth before it, consists of a large
                    array (16×16) of computational units, each of which includes
                    both local memory and code execution capacity. So, all of
                    the weights of various connections in the neural network can
                    be stored exactly where they're needed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Executing neural networks on the chip is also a relatively
                    unusual process. Once the weights and connections of the
                    neural network are placed in buffers on the chip, execution
                    simply requires an external controller—typically a CPU—to
                    upload the data it's meant to operate on (such as an image)
                    and tell it to start. Everything else runs to completion
                    without the CPU's involvement, which should also limit the
                    system-level power consumption.

                    [...] While the tests were run with the NorthPole processor
                    installed on a PCIe card, IBM told Ars that the chip is
                    still viewed as a research prototype, and additional work
                    would be needed to convert it into a commercial product. The
                    company did not indicate whether it would be pursuing
                    commercialization, though.

                    One of the potential limitations of the system is that it
                    can only run neural networks that fit within its hardware.
                    Put too many nodes in a single layer, and NorthPole cannot
                    deal with it. But there is the possibility of splitting up
                    layers and executing segments of them on multiple NorthPole
                    chips in parallel. The hardware has the capacity to handle
                    this, but it hasn't been tested as of yet.

                    Perhaps the biggest limitation, however, is that this is
                    specialized for a single category of AI task. While it's a
                    commonly used one, the efficiency here comes largely from
                    designing hardware that's a good match to the type of
                    execution needed by inference tasks. So, while it's good to
                    see the effort put into dropping the power demands of some
                    AI workloads, we're not at the point yet where we can have a
                    single accelerator that works for all cases.

                    Three years ago, Apple introduced a privacy-enhancing
                    feature that hid the Wi-Fi address of iPhones and iPads when
                    they joined a network. On Wednesday, the world learned that
                    the feature has never worked as advertised. Despite promises
                    that this never-changing address would be hidden and
                    replaced with a private one that was unique to each SSID,
                    Apple devices have continued to display the real one, which
                    in turn got broadcast to every other connected device on the
                    network.<br />[...]<br />In 2020, Apple released iOS 14 with
                    a feature that, by default,
                    <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102509"
                      >hid Wi-Fi MACs</a
                    >
                    when devices connected to a network. Instead, the device
                    displayed what Apple called a "private Wi-Fi address" that
                    was different for each SSID. Over time, Apple has enhanced
                    the feature, for instance, by allowing users to assign a new
                    private Wi-Fi address for a given SSID.

                      >released iOS 17.1</a
                    >. Among the various fixes was a patch for a vulnerability,
                    tracked as
                    <a href="https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-42846"
                      >CVE-2023-42846</a
                    >, which prevented the privacy feature from working. Tommy
                    Mysk, one of the two security researchers Apple credited
                    with discovering and reporting the vulnerability (Talal Haj
                    Bakry was the other), told Ars that he tested all recent iOS
                    releases and found the flaw dates back to version 14,
                    released in September 2020.

                    "From the get-go, this feature was useless because of this
                    bug," he said. "We couldn't stop the devices from sending
                    these discovery requests, even with a VPN. Even in the
                    Lockdown Mode."

                    Despite its mounting cost and schedule delays, NASA remains
                    committed to MSR, and the newly formed response team is
                    trying to find a path forward for the mission given the
                    bleak assessment made by the review board. “We’re looking to
                    harvest as much of the work that we’ve done to date as
                    possible, but also stepping back and looking at ways we can
                    reduce cost and increasing resilience,” Jeff Gramling, MSR
                    director at NASA, is quoted in SpaceNews as saying.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Despite giving it a bad review for execution, the
                    report did highlight the importance of the mission. “A
                    successful MSR campaign will revolutionize our understanding
                    of the history of Mars, the Solar System, and the potential
                    for life beyond Earth,” the report read.

                  <p>
                    For that reason, NASA is moving forward with its plan to
                    return samples from Mars while also trying not to have it
                    impact the rest of the space agency’s scientific endeavors.

                    EU legislators on Tuesday voted to slash use of pesticides
                    by half across the bloc, despite opposition from some
                    conservative groups. But green politicians were left to
                    regret the rejection of a proposed symbolic declaration
                    calling for a complete ban on controversial weedkiller
                    glyphosate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A parliamentary commission rejected making a declaration a
                    month before the 27 member states are due to decide on
                    appeal whether to extend the use of glyphosate, something
                    the WHO fears could be carcinogenic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Earlier this month the bloc failed to agree to do so as
                    divisions emerged and the matter will now go to an appeals
                    committee in early November. Tuesday saw the EU's
                    environment committee vote by a narrow majority—47 votes to
                    37—to set binding targets on reduced pesticide use that
                    targets a 50-percent reduction by 2030.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The pesticides judged the most hazardous will see use pared
                    back by two-thirds compared with 2013-2017. The committee
                    has also banned use of pesticides in designated sensitive
                    areas, including public parks, around schools and at Natura
                    2000 protection sites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among those voting against were the rightwing European
                    People's Party and the far right, while farmers and
                    agri-cooperatives are opposed to seeing the EU impose too
                    tight a set of regulations in the sector.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Austrian Green MEP Sarah Wiener, leading the campaign
                    on the issue, said she was pleased at an outcome bringing
                    agreement "on feasible compromises in an
                    ideologically-charged and industry-dominated discussion."
                    Belgian Socialist lawmaker Marie Arena said the outcome
                    would benefit farmworkers and the environment alike as
                    "abusive use of pesticides makes people sick," as well as
                    decimating bee numbers.

                  would be fairer and more likely to deliver climate justice,

                    Presently most carbon taxes are uniform across all economic
                    sectors - and in the developed nations, their impact
                    disproportionately affects people on lower incomes and are
                    not extensive enough to have a "profound impact on
                    emissions".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers say a differentiated carbon tax system would
                    be fairer as the tax would set higher rates for users of
                    luxury goods and services, which are predominantly consumed
                    by the better off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under the theoretical model described in the paper, the
                    revenues generated from the carbon tax could be used to
                    retrofit insulation in the homes of poorer families to
                    reduce domestic energy consumption.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The scheme we are proposing will introduce a higher
                    carbon tax for luxury goods, such as flying long-haul or
                    driving a high-performance car, and a lower carbon tax for
                    goods and services that meet basic human needs, such as
                    providing housing, cooking and healthcare."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the study team warn that if a luxury goods taxation
                    scheme is to work and deliver significant reductions in
                    carbon dioxide emissions, in line with those set out in the
                    Paris Agreement, it needs to be introduced "promptly,
                    universally and with high and rapidly rising carbon prices
                    as compared to any policy currently in place".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A fair and luxury-focused carbon taxation system is
                    needed because technological solutions alone will not
                    deliver the reduction in carbon emissions that are needed to
                    keep global warming within 1.5 °C. If those solutions do
                    come along, the researchers say the taxation system could
                    then be suitably amended.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It cannot remain status quo to continue environmentally
                    damaging luxury activities unabated while awaiting a
                    technology fix," they say.

                    Do you feel it? The sense that this civilization has run out
                    of creative juice. That we've reached the cliff edge of the

                    That big ideas are dead, killed off by the technocrats of
                    the ruling class. If an idea is proposed that doesn't grow

                  <p>
                    This sense struck me hard recently reading BBC Focus, a
                    popular science magazine. One of the articles was about a
                    team of university researchers in California using AI to
                    predict hit pop songs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Professor Paul Zack said: "Streaming services can readily
                    identify new songs that are likely to be hits for people's
                    playlists more efficiently, making the streaming services
                    jobs easier and delighting listeners."

                    There is so much of this going about. Click on any science
                    tab at any of the big media outlets and there'll be a story
                    about a research "breakthrough" that crushes the soul.
                    Here's a ground-breaking study from the news today about how

                    sense of inquiry that I've read used to exist in the world?
                    It wasn't so long ago that people would spend years writing
                    history-changing theses articulating political, economic,
                    and social models to cast off subjugation and injustice,

                    The ocean's color has changed significantly over the last 20
                    years, and the global trend is likely a consequence of
                    human-induced climate change, report scientists at MIT, the
                    National Oceanography Center in the U.K., and elsewhere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a study appearing today in <em>Nature</em>, the team
                    writes that they have detected changes in ocean color over
                    the past two decades that cannot be explained by natural,
                    year-to-year variability alone. These color shifts, though
                    subtle to the human eye, have occurred over 56 percent of
                    the world's oceans — an expanse that is larger than the
                    total land area on Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In particular, the researchers found that tropical ocean
                    regions near the equator have become steadily greener over
                    time. The shift in ocean color indicates that ecosystems
                    within the surface ocean must also be changing, as the color
                    of the ocean is a literal reflection of the organisms and
                    materials in its waters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "I've been running simulations that have been telling
                    me for years that these changes in ocean color are going to
                    happen," says study co-author Stephanie Dutkiewicz, senior
                    research scientist in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric
                    and Planetary Sciences and the Center for Global Change
                    Science. "To actually see it happening for real is not
                    surprising, but frightening. And these changes are
                    consistent with man-induced changes to our climate."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The color of the oceans has changed," Dutkiewicz
                    says. "And we can't say how. But we can say that changes in
                    color reflect changes in plankton communities, that will
                    impact everything that feeds on plankton. It will also
                    change how much the ocean will take up carbon, because
                    different types of plankton have different abilities to do
                    that. So, we hope people take this seriously. It's not only
                    models that are predicting these changes will happen. We can
                    now see it happening, and the ocean is changing."

                    To Shelby Mustang fans, the Original Venice Crew (OVC) is
                    the stuff of legends. This was the actual team that designed
                    and built the original GT350s, Cobras, Daytona Coupes, and
                    GT40s that introduced Carroll Shelby's name to the masses.
                    Today, OVC builds modern Mustang recreations so accurate
                    that one was approved for last year's Le Mans Classic, which
                    celebrated 100 years of the world's most famous endurance
                    race.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But OVC also offers updated versions of those classics,
                    bringing to life ideas that bounced around the shop back in
                    the day but that Shelby never built in series production.
                    Want a 1965 GT350 with independent rear suspension? OVC can
                    do that, after dialing in a design that Ford originally
                    believed would be too expensive as a replacement for the
                    first-gen Mustang's solid rear axle.

                  <p>
                    These projects don't quite fit under the "restomod"
                    umbrella, instead falling more along the lines of the ideas
                    that OVC founder and boss Jim Marietta remembers from his
                    days back at

                    machined or updated fiberglass front fascias to provide
                    additional airflow.<br />[...]<br />In the 1960s,
                    aerodynamicists struggled with a big gap between common
                    sense design and today's highly refined computational fluid
                    dynamics modeling. LaViolette arrived at Willow Springs
                    fresh off working on the aero packages for some of Shelby
                    American's forthcoming 2024 and '25 Mustangs and told me he
                    looked forward to seeing how the classic methods worked in
                    comparison.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Back in the day, it was one of those things where everybody
                    looked at it and went, 'Why would you do that? The air comes
                    in from the front!'" he laughed before climbing into the
                    driver's seat. "So what we're here today to do is put wool
                    tufts on the car and we're gonna do it old-school and we're
                    gonna see which way the wool flows, see if it starts sucking
                    into the scoop at the back."<br />[...]<br />"It works
                    perfect," he says. "Works just like everybody thought it
                    would... A lot of this is fly by the pants. 'Well, let's try
                    this, try that. OK, how does it seal? You have to move this
                    a little bit, shift it around, do a little bit of different
                    seal rubber.'"

                  <p>
                    "It's what you call American engineering," he chuckles.
                    "What nobody seems to do anymore these days."

                    provides new insight into what may have been motivating the

                    that Unity received some significant pushback from
                    senior-level managers before rolling out its initial
                    fee-restructuring plans. "Half of the people in that meeting
                    said that this model is too complicated, it's not going to
                    be well-received, and we should talk to people before we do
                    this," one anonymous source told the site. "It felt very
                    rushed. We had this meeting and were told it was happening,
                    but we were not told a date. And then before we knew it, it
                    was out there."

                    After the negative reaction to that initial plan, Unity
                    reportedly considered a modification that would take up to 4
                    percent of revenue from the largest Unity
                    publishers—slightly under

                    bringing in over $1.8 billion in revenue in the 12 months
                    ending in June 2023, Unity was

                    tumultuous stock price, which grew from a 2020 IPO price of
                    $68 a share to a peak of nearly $200 a share in late 2021,
                    only to tumble to $37 a share by the beginning of September.

                    An international team of interdisciplinary researchers has
                    successfully created a method for better 3D modeling of
                    complex cancers. The University of Waterloo-based team
                    combined cutting-edge bioprinting techniques with synthetic
                    structures or microfluidic chips. The method will help lab
                    researchers more accurately understand heterogeneous tumors:
                    tumors with more than one kind of cancer cell, often
                    dispersed in unpredictable patterns.

                    Traditionally, medical practitioners would biopsy a
                    patient's tumor, extract cells, and then grow them in flat
                    petri dishes in a lab. "For 50 years, this was how
                    biologists understood tumors," said Nafiseh Moghimi, an
                    applied mathematics post-doctoral researcher and the lead
                    author of the study. "But a decade ago, repeated treatment
                    failures in human trials made scientists realize that a 2D
                    model does not capture the real tumor structure inside the
                    body."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team's research addresses this problem by creating a 3D
                    model that not only reflects the complexity of a tumor but
                    also simulates its surrounding environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] First, the team created polymer "microfluidic chips":
                    tiny structures etched with channels that mimic blood flow
                    and other fluids surrounding a patient's tumor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, the team grew multiple types of cancer cells and
                    suspended these cell cultures in their own customized
                    bioink: a cocktail of gelatin, alginate, and other nutrients
                    designed to keep the cells cultures alive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, they used an extrusion bioprinter—a device that
                    resembles a 3D printer but for organic material—to layer the
                    different types of cancer cells onto the prepared
                    microfluidic chips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The result is a living, three-dimensional model of complex
                    cancers that scientists can then use to test different modes
                    of treatment, such as various chemotherapy drugs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The 3D-printed tumor models exemplify how new
                    technology enables faster, less expensive and less painful
                    treatments for serious conditions like late-stage breast
                    cancer.
