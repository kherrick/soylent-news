                    Unfortunately, the licensing agreement between YouTube and
                    SESAC is nearing its end, and the two have struggled to
                    agree on a new deal. Without an agreement in place, YouTube
                    will no longer be able to host songs covered by SESAC.

                    to reach an agreement on terms for a new deal yet. For this
                    reason, we need to block certain music content on YouTube in

                    It isn't clear when this issue might be resolved.
                    TeamYouTube has stated that while discussions with SESAC are

                    has claimed that YouTube's deal with SESAC doesn't actually
                    expire until next week, speculating that the early takedown
                    may be a negotiating tactic.

                    If so, it's one that won't earn them any goodwill. Many

                    Mashable has reached out to YouTube and SESAC for comment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Until YouTube and SESAC can also reach an agreement, the
                    former's musical landscape is going to sound very different.

                    The financial platform should know what it's talking about,

                    a stake in the company. Fidelity's initial investment,

                    a new partnership with
                    <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/">Valve</a>, the
                    company behind the Steam gaming platform and
                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"
                      >Steam Deck</a
                    >. This collaboration will see Valve financially support two
                    major projects for Arch Linux: an improved build service
                    infrastructure and a secure signing enclave.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] By providing freelance backing, Valve's support allows
                    Arch Linux to work on these critical projects without being
                    hindered by limitations in volunteer time. This will
                    significantly accelerate progress and enable the Arch Linux
                    team to tackle ambitious endeavours that would have
                    otherwise taken much longer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The collaboration will lead to the development of a robust
                    build service infrastructure. This infrastructure will
                    involve servers for building software, potentially similar
                    to continuous integration systems. The system will likely
                    manage compiling and distributing software, simplifying the
                    process and reducing the need for custom setups for
                    different devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The introduction of a secure signing enclave marks a
                    significant advancement in security for Arch Linux. This
                    enclave will leverage code signing to provide a higher level
                    of assurance that packages downloaded from the official
                    repositories haven't been tampered with. Users will be able
                    to cryptographically verify the origin and integrity of
                    software packages, making it much harder for malicious
                    actors to distribute compromised software.

                There is speculation that Valve might publicly release SteamOS
                in the future or that native support for games on GNU/Linux will
                improve greatly.

                    There are few bigger names in the world of motorcycles than
                    Harley-Davidson. The brand has been churning out two-wheeled
                    classics left and right for over a century, cultivating a
                    fanbase like no other. Along the way,

                    arise, in addition to plenty that have fallen by the
                    wayside. Seeing as it's rarely talked about in the modern
                    era, it's no stretch to say that one of these overlooked
                    points on the Harley timeline is the brand's brief foray
                    into lawn mower technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yes, as it was making its name as one of the United States'
                    foremost motorcycle manufacturers, Harley-Davidson took a
                    detour into landscaping territory. Way back in 1929, the
                    company began providing single cylinder side-valve engines
                    for the Worthington Mower Company's Overgreen lawn mowers.
                    These massive mowers were used commercially to cut large
                    swaths of grass like golf courses. Harley's engines powered
                    them throughout the Great Depression, though the motorcycle
                    giant didn't stick with lawn mowers for the long haul. Thus,
                    it was never destined to sit alongside
                    <a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It has been nearly 100 years since Harley-Davidson's
                    Worthington collaboration came and went, yet some folks are
                    still keen on trying to power their mowers with the bike
                    favorite's technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With modern perceptions of Harley-Davidson as strictly a
                    motorcycle brand, the idea of it contributing to the
                    Worthington Mower Company's Overgreen lawn mowers sounds
                    absurd. After all, throughout its century-long history, it
                    has only branched out to create non-motorcycle products a
                    few times. For instance, it created the LR-64 drone rocket
                    engine for the U.S. military, and took a dip in the marine
                    technology pool with its purchase of the Tomahawk Boating
                    Company in 1961. Still, this hasn't prevented some folks
                    from trying to bring its modern tech to back to the realm of
                    landscaping.

                    Over on YouTube,

                      >Specialised Motorcycle Transport</a
                    >
                    showcased what a modern lawn mower could look like with a
                    Harley engine inside. It looks like a conventional riding
                    mower with some unique aesthetic touches, but sounds just
                    like motorcycle and is designed to get the speed of one too.
                    This contraption was constructed for racing purposes rather
                    than lawn maintenance.

                    on YouTube featured a similar piece on their channel. This
                    orange riding mower — dubbed the "mower cycle" — came
                    equipped with a 1,500cc Harley engine, certainly making it
                    better suited for the racetrack than for cutting grass. It
                    more than likely can't outrun

                    the dust.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Odds are Harley-Davidson's efforts in terms of lawn mowing
                    are long over, but so long as mechanics can make its engines
                    compatible with the latest riding mowers, chances are its
                    legacy in the space will endure well into the future.

                  <p>
                    Fifth, the GDPR, on principle, posits that every processing
                    of personal data restricts the data subject’s right to data
                    protection. It requires, therefore, that each of these
                    processes needs a justification based on the law. The GDPR
                    deems any processing of personal data as a potential risk
                    and forbids its processing in principle. It only allows
                    processing if a legal ground is met. Such an anti-processing
                    and anti-sharing approach may not make sense in a
                    data-driven economy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sixth, the law does not distinguish between low-risk and
                    high-risk applications by imposing the same obligations for
                    each type of data processing application, with a few
                    exceptions requiring consultation of the Data Processing
                    Administrator for high-risk applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Seventh, the GDPR also excludes exemptions for low-risk
                    processing scenarios or when SMEs, startups, non-commercial
                    entities, or private citizens are the data controllers.
                    Further, there are no exemptions or provisions that protect
                    the rights of the controller and of third parties for such
                    scenarios in which the data controller has a legitimate
                    interest in protecting business and trade secrets,
                    fulfilling confidentiality obligations, or the economic
                    interest in avoiding huge and disproportionate efforts to
                    meet GDPR obligations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eighth, the GDPR lacks a mechanism that allows SMEs and
                    startups to shift the compliance burden onto third parties,
                    which then store and process data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ninth, the GPR relies heavily on government-based
                    bureaucratic monitoring and administration of GDPR privacy
                    compliance. This means an extensive bureaucratic system is
                    needed to manage the compliance regime.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are other issues with GDPR enforcement (see pieces by
                    <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gdpr-2022"

                    called by Llama Group, will receive a few updates per year,
                    adding new features and ensuring proper security practices.
                    Just don't get your hopes up about creating alternative
                    projects from this "freely" available code.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Llama Group is looking to the

                    for help in developing new capabilities and maintaining (or
                    even modernizing) a codebase that dates back several
                    decades. Originally introduced in 1997, Winamp has long been
                    praised for its flexibility and broad compatibility with
                    various audio formats.

                  <p>
                    [...] Winamp's source code is now freely available, but the
                    license it was released under has sparked controversy. The
                    <a

                    >
                    imposes significant restrictions on what people can do with
                    the code, including a ban on releasing modified third-party
                    modified versions. The license explicitly states that no
                    public forks are permitted, and only the maintainers of the
                    official repository are allowed to release the software or
                    any new (approved) modifications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Llama Group appears eager to benefit from community
                    contributions to Winamp, but the software itself cannot be
                    repurposed to create something new. Despite the legal
                    threat, developers are undeterred, with hundreds of
                    "unofficial" forks of Winamp's source code already surfacing
                    online. As time goes on, this trend is only expected to
                    grow.

                  <p>
                    Legal concerns aside, it seems clear that Llama Group no
                    longer wants the full responsibility of maintaining the
                    still-popular PC media player. The company has shifted its

                    in Antarctica has concluded with a grim outlook on its
                    future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Often dubbed the “doomsday glacier”, this huge mass of ice
                    is comparable in size to Britain or Florida and its collapse
                    alone would raise sea levels by 65 centimetres. Worse still,
                    this is expected to trigger a more widespread loss of the
                    ice sheet covering West Antarctica, causing a calamitous sea
                    level rise of 3.3 metres and threatening cities like New
                    York, Kolkata and Shanghai.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is an extremely remote and difficult area to get to, but
                    the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC), a
                    joint UK-US research programme, has managed to deploy 100
                    scientists there over the past six years, using planes,
                    ships and underwater robots to study the dynamics of this
                    ice in detail.  “It was a tremendous challenge, and yet we
                    really learned a lot,” says
                    <a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/people/ted-scambos"
                      >Ted Scambos</a
                    >
                    at University of Colorado Boulder.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These discoveries include the fact that Thwaites glacier is
                    particularly vulnerable, as it rests on a bed of rock that
                    is well below sea level and is being melted from the
                    underside by warmer seawater. What’s more, the bedrock
                    slopes downwards towards the interior of the ice sheet, so,
                    as the glacier retreats, even more ice is exposed to warm
                    seawater, threatening to accelerate the collapse.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “It’s not going to instantaneously lead to a
                    catastrophic retreat in the next year or the year after,
                    but, at the same time, we are very sure that Thwaites is
                    going to continue to retreat, and ultimately the retreat is
                    going to accelerate,” says
                    <a href="https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/rdla/">Rob Larter</a>
                    at the British Antarctic Survey, another member of the team.
                    “We can’t put an exact time frame on that.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, however, the ITCG researchers think that, by the
                    end of the 23<sup>rd</sup> century, Thwaites glacier and
                    much of the West Antarctic ice sheet might be lost.

                    On Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman outlined his vision for an
                    AI-driven future of tech progress and global prosperity in a
                    new personal blog post titled "<a

                    accelerated by AI, with Altman suggesting that
                    superintelligent AI could emerge within the next decade.

                    "It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few
                    thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I'm confident

                    in performing many tasks without the need for specific
                    training. By contrast, superintelligence surpasses AGI, and
                    it could be seen as a hypothetical level of machine
                    intelligence that can dramatically outperform humans at any

                    "If we want to put AI into the hands of as many people as
                    possible," Altman writes in his essay, "we need to drive
                    down the cost of compute and make it abundant (which
                    requires lots of energy and chips). If we don't build enough
                    infrastructure, AI will be a very limited resource that wars
                    get fought over and that becomes mostly a tool for rich
                    people."<br />[...]<br />While enthusiastic about AI's
                    potential, Altman urges caution, too, but vaguely. He
                    writes, "We need to act wisely but with conviction. The dawn
                    of the Intelligence Age is a momentous development with very
                    complex and extremely high-stakes challenges. It will not be
                    an entirely positive story, but the upside is so tremendous
                    that we owe it to ourselves, and the future, to figure out
                    how to navigate the risks in front of us."<br />[...]<br />"Many
                    of the jobs we do today would have looked like trifling
                    wastes of time to people a few hundred years ago, but nobody
                    is looking back at the past, wishing they were a
                    lamplighter," he wrote. "If a lamplighter could see the
                    world today, he would think the prosperity all around him
                    was unimaginable. And if we could fast-forward a hundred
                    years from today, the prosperity all around us would feel
                    just as unimaginable."

                    If you're thinking of going down the unconventional route
                    for this year's Halloween costume, we've got just the
                    inspiration for you: a brand-new species of chimaera, better
                    known as a ghost shark or

                    Scientists discovered the new species, which goes by the
                    scientific name <em>Harriotta avia</em> –
                    <em>avia</em> meaning "grandmother" in Latin, in honor of
                    study author Dr Brit Finucci's grandmother – and the common
                    name Australasian Narrow-nosed Spookfish, off the coast of
                    New Zealand and Australia.

                    – the study describing the new species dubs it "a global
                    diversity [hotspot] for chimaeroids" – but it was previously
                    thought that this particular species wasn't actually its own
                    species at all. Instead, it was believed to be a variant of
                    another species, <em>Harriotta raleighana</em>, which is
                    found across the globe.

                  <p>
                    But with the help of genetics and a closer inspection of its
                    morphology, the researchers were able to identify
                    <em>H. avia</em> as a species in its own right.

                  <p>
                    "<em>Harriotta avia</em> is unique due to its elongated,
                    narrow and depressed snout; long, slender trunk; large eyes;
                    and very long, broad pectoral fins," said Finucci in a

                    [...] "Ghost sharks like this one are largely confined to
                    the ocean floor, living in depths of up to 2,600 [meters]
                    [8530 feet]," said Finucci. The level of pressure to be

                    "Their habitat makes them hard to study and monitor, meaning
                    we don't know a lot about their biology or threat status,
                    but it makes discoveries like this even more exciting,"
                    Finucci explained.

                    What we do know is that, despite the nickname, ghost sharks
                    aren't actually sharks at all. Whilst the two groups are
                    still related to each other, it's thought that they

                    from one another other nearly 400 million years ago. Both
                    remained cartilaginous, but ghost sharks have wound up with
                    several physical differences from their relatives.

                    This is where the trucks come in: The traffic on German
                    autobahns that most consistently conforms to that pattern
                    are the swarms of semis that are constantly crisscrossing
                    the country. "The trucks are generally limited to 80km/h
                    (50mph)," says Drive Pilot test engineer Jochen Haab," but
                    they usually travel at about 90km/h, and up to 95km/h on
                    downhills."<br />Drive Pilot 95 could operate without having
                    to follow traffic, Haab says, but making that part of its
                    operational design domain provides an additional safety
                    redundancy: If there is traffic ahead, and it is moving, the
                    car knows for certain the road ahead is clear without
                    needing to process more data to double check.<br />A highly
                    precise positioning antenna mounted in the roof enables the
                    car to know, to within a fraction of an inch, exactly where
                    it is in terms of its absolute position, its relative
                    position, and its position correlated to carefully measured
                    landmarks on an HD map built from data collected
                    Mercedes-Benz engineers who drove every single mile of
                    Germany's 8,196-mile autobahn network in both directions and
                    in every lane.

                    Ferroelectric memory (FRAM) is an interesting storage
                    technique that stores bits in a special "ferroelectric"
                    material. Ferroelectric memory is nonvolatile like flash
                    memory, able to hold its data for decades. But, unlike
                    flash, ferroelectric memory can write data rapidly.
                    Moreover, FRAM is much more durable than flash and can be be
                    written trillions of times. With these advantages, you might
                    wonder why FRAM isn't more popular. The problem is that FRAM
                    is much more expensive than flash, so it is only used in
                    niche applications.

                    [...] The history of ferroelectric memory dates back to the
                    early 1950s.3 Many companies worked on FRAM from the 1950s
                    to the 1970s, including Bell Labs, IBM, RCA, and Ford. The
                    1955 photo below shows a 256-bit ferroelectric memory built
                    by Bell Labs. Unfortunately, ferroelectric memory had many
                    problems,4 limiting it to specialized applications, and
                    development was mostly abandoned by the 1970s.

                  <p>
                    Ferroelectric memory had a second chance, though. A major
                    proponent of ferroelectric memory was George Rohrer, who
                    started working on ferroelectric memory in 1968. He formed a
                    memory company, Technovation, which was unsuccessful, and
                    then cofounded Ramtron in 1984.5 Ramtron produced a tiny
                    256-bit memory chip in 1988, followed by much larger
                    memories in the 1990s.

                    "How enzymes tie a lasso knot is a fascinating question.
                    This study provides a first glimpse of the biophysical
                    interactions responsible for producing this unique
                    structure," said Diwakar Shukla, an associate professor of
                    chemical and biomolecular engineering.

                    "We also showed that these molecular contacts are the same
                    in several different cyclases across different phyla. Even
                    though we have not tested every system, we believe it's a
                    generalizable model," Barrett said.

                    Collaborating with the San Diego-based company Lassogen, the
                    researchers showed that the new insights can guide cyclase
                    engineering to generate lasso peptides that otherwise cannot
                    be made. As a proof-of-concept, they engineered a different
                    cyclase, called McjC, to efficiently produce a potent
                    inhibitor of a cancer-promoting integrin.

                    "The ability to generate lasso peptide diversity is
                    important for optimizing drugs," said Mark Burk, CEO of
                    Lassogen. "The enzymes from nature do not always allow us to
                    produce the lasso peptides of interest and the ability to
                    engineer lasso cyclases greatly expands the therapeutic
                    utility of these amazing molecules."

                    powerful computing and recent advances in artificial

                    Chemistry. "This work is an extraordinary example of how

                    Shares of General Motors and Ford Motor traded lower on
                    Wednesday after Morgan Stanley downgraded the overall U.S.
                    auto sector, citing worries that Western automakers might
                    struggle in the intensifying competition with Chinese

                    weight," and its shares fell 5.4 percentage points, to
                    $45.50. Ford went to "equal weight" from "overweight," with
                    its shares dropping more than 4 percentage points, to
                    $10.43.

                    Investors sold after Morgan Stanley analysts warned about

                    suggesting that even small surges in China's industrial

                    [...] Bolstered in part by massive government subsidies,
                    Chinese manufacturers have rapidly emerged as major players
                    in the EV industry, accounting for 60 percent of worldwide
                    EV sales and almost one in five EVs sold in Europe last

                    The report also highlights that poor data across government
                    departments meant officials didn't know how much they were
                    spending and with whom. And new providers that could perhaps
                    deliver better services for less money are discouraged from
                    bidding for business.

                There is a fair, and long running, amount of research for that
                playing Tetris helps people deal with trauma, PTSD of some kind.
                Adding some more recent research then where it can reduce PTSD
                symptoms in healthcare workers (nurses) that worked with trauma
                COVID19 patients.

                Playing something such as Tetris (it's a bit unclear if it's
                just Tetris or a similar style of games of which Tetris is the
                prime example) can induce some relaxing zen like state or a
                "cognitive vaccine". 20 minutes is apparently the prescribed
                dosage of rotational healing experience. There was the 15
                minutes of talking to before playing Tetris. But clearly the
                healing power of Tetris at work ...

                    The study was carried out with healthcare workers in Sweden
                    who worked with COVID-19 patients and were exposed to
                    work-related trauma. It was conducted during the COVID-19
                    pandemic between September 2020 and April 2022. A total of
                    164 participants were included. Participants were recruited
                    through information at workplaces. Participation was
                    entirely voluntary. The criterion for participation was that
                    the person had at least two intrusive memories per week due
                    to traumatic events that occurred at work.

                    A truck full of lithium-ion batteries is burning in Los
                    Angeles, shutting down ports and a bridge. It’s not clear
                    what the batteries were for — but LA’s Vincent Thomas
                    Bridge, leading to the Port of Los Angeles and the next-door
                    Port of Long Beach, has been shut down for at least 15 hours
                    now while local firefighters let the truck burn. State Route
                    47 was also closed in both directions as of a couple of
                    hours ago.

                    shut down a number of terminals while the fire continues to
                    burn. As of 12:10PM PT on Friday, the truck was still on
                    fire, and both the ports and bridge were still closed, Los
                    Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) spokesperson Ren Medina told

                    >, big concentrated lithium battery fires can be very
                    difficult to put out: firefighters sometimes douse them with
                    thousands of gallons of water only to see the fire restart
                    as additional battery cells heat up to the point that they
                    combust. Once a cell gets hot enough, it’s said to go into
                    “thermal runaway,” at which point it can sometimes restart a
                    fire. The LAFD confirms this is a case of thermal runaway.

                  <p>
                    EV packs are particularly dense with cells, but we don’t yet
                    know if they were involved here — the LA Fire Department
                    spokesperson says it’s not clear who owns the truck, let
                    alone what it was carrying. The LAFD could only confirm they
                    are lithium-ion batteries at this point.

                A senior RedMonk analyst tried to prove shifting to proprietary

                >
                -- from a VC at OSS Capital, ex-Googlers, Chef's co-founder, and
                even Taylor Dolezal, head of ecosystem at the Cloud Native
                Computing Community. Plus analyst Lawrence Hecht, who concluded
                "these companies are nowhere closer to being profitable than
                before."
              </p>
              <p>
                There's new quotes from the analyst herself. ("I asked Stephens
                if she thought the analysis would have an impact in the future
                on companies considering moves to proprietary licensing. 'I
                doubt it,' Stephens replied...") And Hecht pounds away at the
                missteps. ("The assumption has been that closing a company's
                license will allow the companies to increase their margins among
                their existing customers... The percentage of companies using a
                given technology is not changing... Elasticsearch fell from 14%
                to 13%..")
              </p>
              <p>
                Interestingly, the study hits right as Elastic is switching
                *back* to an open-source license. They weigh in in this article
                too...
              </p>
              <p>
                It's the discussion about open source licensing that really
                needed to happen.

                    Hardware hacker Dmitry Grinberg recently achieved what might
                    sound impossible:
                    <a
                      href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=35.%20Linux4004"

                    >
                    the world's first commercial microprocessor. With just 2,300
                    transistors and an original clock speed of 740 kHz, the 1971
                    CPU is incredibly primitive by modern standards. And it's
                    slow—it takes about 4.76 days for the Linux kernel to boot.

                    [....] If you're skeptical that this feat is possible with a
                    raw 4004, you're right: The 4004 itself is far too limited
                    to run Linux directly. Instead, Grinberg created a solution
                    that is equally impressive: an emulator that runs on the
                    4004 and emulates a MIPS R3000 processor—the architecture
                    used in the

                    In a study published July 29 in
                    <a

                      ><i>Advanced Materials</i></a
                    >, University of Texas at Dallas researchers found that
                    X-rays of the kidneys using gold nanoparticles as a contrast
                    agent might be more accurate in detecting kidney disease
                    than standard laboratory blood tests. Based on their study
                    in mice, they also found that caution may be warranted in
                    employing renal-clearable nanomedicines to patients with
                    compromised kidneys.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before administering renal-clearable drugs, doctors
                    routinely check a patient's kidney function by testing their
                    blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels. With
                    the increasing use of engineered nanoparticles to deliver
                    payloads of drugs or imaging agents to the body, an
                    important question is how the nanoparticles' movement and
                    elimination through the kidney is affected by kidney damage.
                    Can traditional biomarkers like BUN and Cr accurately
                    predict how well—or how poorly—such nanoparticles will move
                    through the kidneys?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The UT Dallas researchers found that in mice with severely
                    injured kidneys caused by the drug cisplatin, in which BUN
                    and Cr levels were 10 times normal, nanoparticle transport
                    through the kidneys was slowed down significantly, a
                    situation that caused the nanoparticles to stay in the
                    kidneys longer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In mildly injured kidneys, however, in which BUN and Cr
                    levels were only four to five times higher than normal, the
                    transport and retention of gold nanoparticles couldn't be
                    predicted by those tests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the other hand, the amount of gold nanoparticle
                    accumulation seen on X-rays did correlate strongly with the
                    degree of kidney damage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "While our findings emphasize the need for caution when
                    using these advanced treatments in patients with compromised
                    kidneys, they also highlight the potential of gold
                    nanoparticles as a noninvasive way to assess kidney injuries
                    using X-ray imaging or other techniques that correlate with
                    gold accumulation in the kidneys," said Dr. Mengxiao Yu, a

                    When security researcher Johann Rehberger recently reported
                    a vulnerability in ChatGPT that allowed attackers to store
                    false information and malicious instructions in a user's
                    long-term memory settings, OpenAI summarily closed the
                    inquiry, labeling the flaw a safety issue, not, technically
                    speaking, a security concern.

                    proof-of-concept exploit that used the vulnerability to
                    exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. OpenAI engineers
                    took notice and issued a partial fix earlier this month.

                    later, China's birds rode a Long March 3B that launched from

                    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
                    the federal body that sets technology standards for
                    governmental agencies, standards organizations, and private
                    companies, has proposed barring some of the most vexing and
                    nonsensical password requirements. Chief among them:
                    mandatory resets, required or restricted use of certain
                    characters, and the use of security questions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Choosing strong passwords and storing them safely is one of
                    the most challenging parts of a good cybersecurity regimen.
                    More challenging still is complying with password rules
                    imposed by employers, federal agencies, and providers of
                    online services. Frequently, the rules—ostensibly to enhance
                    security hygiene—actually undermine it. And yet, the
                    nameless rulemakers impose the requirements anyway.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A section devoted to passwords injects a large helping
                    of badly needed common sense practices that challenge common
                    policies. An example: The new rules bar the requirement that
                    end users periodically change their passwords. This
                    requirement came into being decades ago when password
                    security was poorly understood, and it was common for people
                    to choose common names, dictionary words, and other secrets
                    that were easily guessed.

                Keeping up with the latest in hardware is hard, and in the early

                Today, we've hit some fatigue and just don't keep up as much.
                Right? :-) Anyway, while most of us have heard of Dell's (and
                Lenovo's) proposal for CAMM modules to replace the multi-stick
                SO-DIMM sockets, servers are getting a new standard, too:

                    By implementing DDR5 physical and electrical standards,
                    MRDIMM technology delivers a memory advancement that allows
                    scaling of both bandwidth and capacity per core to
                    future-proof compute systems and meets the expanding demands
                    of data center workloads. MRDIMMs provide the following
                    advantages over RDIMMs: 2
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Up to 39% increase in effective memory bandwidth2</li>
                    <li>Greater than 15% better bus efficiency2</li>
                    <li>Up to 40% latency improvements compared to RDIMMs3</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    MRDIMMs support a wide capacity range from 32GB to 256GB in
                    standard and tall form factors (TFF), which are suitable for
                    high-performance 1U and 2U servers. The improved thermal
                    design of TFF modules reduces DRAM temperatures by up to 20
                    degrees Celsius at the same power and airflow, [...]
                    enabling more efficient cooling capabilities in data centers
                    and optimizing total system task energy for memory-intensive
                    workloads. Micron's industry-leading memory design and
                    process technology using 32Gb DRAM die enables 256GB TFF
                    MRDIMMs to have the same power envelope as 128GB TFF MRDIMMs
                    using 16Gb die. A 256GB TFF MRDIMM provides a 35%
                    improvement in performance over similar-capacity TSV RDIMMs
                    at the maximum data rate.

                    Back in June, the

                    >
                    that would require carriers to unlock all phones within 60
                    days of activation. At the time, the FCC was seeking public
                    comment on the proposal, with plans to vote on whether to
                    pursue the issue in early July. Since then, the proposal has
                    been unanimously approved by the five-member commission, and
                    the plan marches forward. To be clear, this doesn’t mean a
                    new unlock policy is happening anytime soon; it just means
                    that the FCC will continue to actively pursue these
                    regulatory changes. Unsurprisingly,
                    <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/att-plans-785600/"
                      >AT&amp;T</a

                    >
                    have both spoken up against the change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AT&amp;T has indicated that the rule changes could
                    negatively affect its ability to offer affordable devices,
                    though that’s about the extent of its opposition so far.
                    T-Mobile has been considerably more vocal. The “Uncarrier”
                    has not only made it clear that this change could negatively
                    impact their device payment plans and other services, but it
                    has also gone so far as to imply that the change might cause
                    the carrier to give up on payment plans altogether (as first
                    reported by B<a
                      href="https://broadbandbreakfast.com/t-mobile-unlocking-phones-after-60-days-a-major-question/"
                      ><em>roadband Breakfast</em></a
                    >). Furthermore, the carrier questions whether the FCC even
                    has the authorization to pursue such a change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] You might notice that I’ve yet to mention
                    <a
                      href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-verizon-plans-1141575/"
                      >Verizon</a
                    >, and that’s for good reason. Big Red is the only major
                    carrier vocally in support of the change. As you likely
                    guessed, the reason isn’t out of the kindness of their
                    hearts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Back in 2008, the FCC reached an agreement with Verizon
                    regarding the use of the 700MHz spectrum, with the carrier
                    agreeing to prompt device unlocks. In 2019, the FCC agreed
                    to implement a 60-day unlocking window to help Verizon
                    combat potential fraud around its payment plans and special
                    deal pricing. In other words, Verizon is already abiding by
                    this change, so it loses nothing by supporting it—in fact,
                    it might even have something to gain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Right now, many carriers, both prepaid and postpaid, offer
                    free trials through eSIM. While AT&amp;T and T-Mobile limit
                    these kinds of trials due to their current unlocking
                    policies, it’s much easier to try out a different network
                    while still keeping your Verizon phone and subscription.
                    This means a Verizon customer has a greater chance to shop
                    for other networks than those on another carrier, increasing
                    their chances of being lured away by a competitor. If all
                    carriers adhere to the same 60-day window, the playing field
                    becomes level.

                    struggles to reinvent itself for the electric era.

                    Manager Magazin suggested research and development could
                    take a massive hit. If their numbers pan out, roughly 4,000

                    Before Electronic Arts (EA) was the publishing juggernaut
                    that it is today, it was just one of dozens of software
                    publishers putting out titles for various home computers,
                    including the IBM PC. EA was founded in 1982 by Trip
                    Hawkins, who would go on to create the ultimately
                    unsuccessful 3DO game console. In the mid-1980's, EA was
                    perhaps most famous for their paint program, Deluxe Paint,
                    which became a popular graphics tool for the whole computer
                    gaming industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unlike the companies we have covered to date, EA is mostly
                    widely known for their games, not their copy protection
                    schemes. EA is famous enough that a long segue into their
                    corporate history isn't really necessary - you can just read
                    the Wikipedia entry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    EA wasn't selling their copy protection technology, so there
                    are no flashy advertisements extolling its virtues or many
                    articles discussing it at all. All that is left to talk
                    about is the protection itself.

                    Certificate authorities and browser makers are planning to
                    end the use of
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS">WHOIS</a> data
                    verifying domain ownership following a report that
                    demonstrated how threat actors could abuse the process to
                    obtain fraudulently issued TLS certificates.

                  <p>
                    TLS certificates are the cryptographic credentials that
                    underpin HTTPS connections, a critical component of online
                    communications verifying that a server belongs to a trusted
                    entity and encrypts all traffic passing between it and an
                    end user. These credentials are issued by any one of
                    hundreds of CAs (certificate authorities) to domain owners.
                    The rules for how certificates are issued and the process
                    for verifying the rightful owner of a domain are left to the
                    <a href="https://cabforum.org/">CA/Browser Forum</a>. One
                    "base requirement rule" allows CAs to send an email to an
                    address listed in the WHOIS record for the domain being
                    applied for. When the receiver clicks an enclosed link, the
                    certificate is automatically approved.

                    This method has high selectivity—meaning it produces a large
                    amount of the desired product. That means propylene derived
                    from polyethylene, and both propylene and isobutylene
                    derived from polypropylene. Both of these chemicals are in
                    high demand, since propylene is an important raw material
                    for the chemical industry, while isobutylene is a frequently
                    used monomer in many different polymers, including synthetic
                    rubber and a gasoline additive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because plastics are often mixed at recycling centers, the
                    researchers wanted to see what would happen if polypropylene
                    and polyethylene underwent isomerizing ethenolysis together.
                    The reaction was successful, converting the mixture into
                    propylene and isobutylene, with slightly more propylene than
                    isobutylene.

                    [...] While this recycling method sounds like it could
                    prevent tons upon tons of waste, it will need to be scaled
                    up enormously for this to happen. When the research team
                    increased the scale of the experiment, it produced the same
                    yield, which looks promising for the future. Still, we’ll
                    need to build considerable infrastructure before this could
                    make a dent in our plastic waste.

                    U.S. authorities have dismantled a massive botnet run by
                    hackers backed by the Chinese government, according to a
                    speech given by FBI director Christopher Wray on Wednesday.
                    The botnet malware infected a number of different types of
                    internet-connected devices around the world, including home
                    routers, cameras, digital video recorders, and NAS drives.
                    Those devices were used to help infiltrate sensitive
                    networks related to universities, government agencies,
                    telecommunications providers, and media organizations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wray explained the operation at the
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mmVUVp3iJ8o"
                      >Aspen Digital</a
                    >
                    conference and said the hackers work for a Beijing-based
                    company called Integrity Technology Group, which is known to
                    U.S. researchers as Flax Typhoon. The botnet was launched in
                    mid-2021, according to the FBI, and infected roughly 260,000
                    devices as of June 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The operation to dismantle the botnet was coordinated by the
                    FBI, the NSA, and the Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF),
                    according to a press release dated
                    <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2024/240918.pdf"
                      >Wednesday</a
                    >. The U.S. Department of Justice received a court order to
                    take control of the botnet infrastructure by sending
                    disabling commands to the malware on infected devices. The
                    hackers tried to counterattack by hitting FBI infrastructure
                    but were "ultimately unsuccessful," according to the law
                    enforcement agency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    About half of the devices hijacked were in the U.S.,
                    according to Wray, but there were also devices identified as
                    compromised in South America, Europe, Africa, Southeast
                    Asia, and Australia. And the DOJ noted in a press release
                    that authorities in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the
                    UK all helped take down the botnet.

                    New Starlink customers have to pay a $100 "congestion
                    charge" in areas where the satellite broadband network has
                    limited capacity.

                    says. "This fee will only apply if you are purchasing or
                    activating a new service plan. If you change your Service
                    address or Service Plan at a later date, you may be charged

                  <p>
                    The charge is unwelcome for anyone wanting Starlink service
                    in a congested area, but it could help prevent the capacity
                    crunch from getting worse by making people think twice about
                    signing up. The SpaceX-owned Internet service provider also
                    seems to anticipate that people who sign up for service in
                    congested areas may change their minds after trying it out
                    for a few weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our intention is to no longer charge this fee to new
                    customers as soon as network capacity improves. If you're
                    not satisfied with Starlink and return it within the 30-day
                    return window, the charge will be refunded," the company
                    said.

                    CERN was founded in the wake of World War II as a place
                    dedicated to the peaceful pursuit of science. The
                    organization currently has 24 member states and, in 2019
                    alone, hosted about 12,400 users from institutions in more
                    than 70 countries. Russia has never been a full member of
                    CERN, but collaborations first began in 1955, with hundreds
                    of Russia-affiliated scientists contributing to experiments
                    in the ensuing decades. Now, that 60-year history of
                    collaboration, and Russia's long-standing observer status,
                    is ending. As World Nuclear News

                    The decision to end the cooperation agreement was taken in
                    December 2023 when CERN's Council passed a resolution "to
                    terminate the International Cooperation Agreement between
                    CERN and the Russian Federation, together with all related
                    protocols and addenda, with effect from 30 November 2024; To
                    terminate ... all other agreements and experiment memoranda
                    of understanding allowing the participation of the Russian
                    Federation and its national institutes in the CERN
                    scientific programme, with effect from 30 November 2024;
                    AFFIRMS That these measures concern the relationship between
                    CERN and Russian and Belarusian institutes and do not affect
                    the relationship with scientists of Russian nationality
                    affiliated with other institutes." The cooperation agreement
                    with Belarus will come to an end on 27 June, before the
                    Russian one ends.

                    It's unclear how this decision will impact scientific
                    research at CERN. Russia's 4.5 percent contribution to the
                    combined budget for ongoing experiments at the Large Hadron
                    Collider has already been covered by other collaboration
                    members. Some think the effects will be minimal since
                    researchers have had plenty of time to prepare for the exit.
                    Certain essential staff members have successfully found
                    employment outside of Russia so that they can stay on.

                    Others are less confident. “It will leave a hole. I think

                    The Arc browser's 'Boosts' feature would've allowed bad
                    actors to edit a website and add a malicious payload that
                    their target could download to their computer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the feature that separates the Arc browser from its
                    competitors is the ability to customize websites. The
                    feature called "Boosts" allows users to change a website's
                    background color, switch to a font they like or one that
                    makes it easier for them to read and even remove an unwanted
                    elements from the page completely. Their alterations aren't
                    supposed to be be visible to anyone else, but they can share
                    them across devices. Now, Arc's creator, the Browser
                    Company, has admitted that a security researcher found a
                    serious flaw that would've allowed attackers to use Boosts
                    to compromise their targets' systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company used Firebase, which the security researcher
                    known as "xyzeva" described as a "database-as-a-backend
                    service" in their post about the vulnerability, to support
                    several Arc features. For Boosts, in particular, it's used
                    to share and sync customizations across devices. In xyzeva's
                    post, they showed how the browser relies on a creator's
                    identification (creatorID) to load Boosts on a device. They
                    also shared how someone could change that element to their
                    target's identification tag and assign that target Boosts
                    that they had created.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If a bad actor makes a Boost with a malicious payload, for
                    instance, they can just change their creatorID to the
                    creatorID of their intended target. When the intended victim
                    then visits the website on Arc, they could unknowingly
                    download the hacker's malware. And as the researcher
                    explained, it's pretty easy to get user IDs for the browser.
                    A user who refer someone to Arc will share their ID to the
                    recipient, and if they also created an account from a
                    referral, the person who sent it will also get their ID.
                    Users can also share their Boosts with others, and Arc has a
                    page with public Boosts that contain the creatorIDs of the
                    people who made them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In its post, the Browser Company said xyzeva notified it
                    about the security issue on August 25 and that it issued a
                    fix a day later with the researcher's help.

                    Google employees were well aware of how their written words
                    could be used against the company, the DOJ argued, pointing
                    to the company's "Communicate with Care" legal training for
                    employees. In one 2019 email, Srinivasan copied a lawyer on
                    an email to colleagues about an ad tech feature and reminded
                    the group to be careful with their language. "We should be
                    particularly careful when framing something as a
                    'circumvention,'" he wrote. "We should assume that every
                    document (and email) we generate will likely be seen by
                    regulators." The email was labeled "PRIVILEGED and
                    CONFIDENTIAL."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the many documents shown by the DOJ demonstrate that
                    Google often discussed business decisions in writing, at
                    other times, they seemed to intentionally leave the
                    documentation sparse. "Keeping the notes limited due to
                    sensitivity of the subject," a

                    follow up on explicit [action items]."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We take seriously our obligations to preserve and produce
                    relevant documents," Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels
                    said in a statement. "We have for years responded to
                    inquiries and litigation, and we educate our employees about
                    legal privilege. In the DOJ cases alone, we have produced
                    millions of documents including chat messages and documents
                    not covered by legal privilege."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The judge in Google's first antitrust battle with the DOJ
                    over its search business declined to go as far as an adverse
                    inference,even though he

                      >ruled against Google in most other ways</a
                    >. Still, he made clear he wasn't "condoning Google's
                    failure to preserve chat evidence" and said, "Any company
                    that puts the onus on employees to identify and preserve
                    relevant evidence does so at its own peril. Google avoided
                    sanctions in this case. It may not be so lucky in the next
                    one."

                    Getting Rust into the Linux kernel has been a hot topic for
                    some time.

                      >In 2022</a
                    >, developers were arguing over the language, with some
                    calling the memory safety features of Rust an "insult" to
                    some of the hard work that had gone into the kernel over the
                    years. At the beginning of September, one of the maintainers
                    of the Rust for Linux projects
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/02/rust_for_linux_maintainer_steps_down/"

                  <p>
                    During the conversation at the Linux Foundation's Open
                    Source Summit in Vienna this week, Torvalds continued,
                    "Clearly, there are people who just don't like the notion of
                    Rust, and having Rust encroach on their area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "People have even been talking about the Rust integration
                    being a failure … We've been doing this for a couple of
                    years now so it's way too early to even say that, but I also
                    think that even if it were to become a failure – and I don't
                    think it will – that's how you learn," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "So I see the whole Rust thing as positive, even if the
                    arguments are not necessarily always [so]."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Keen to pull those positives from the row, Torvalds added,
                    "One of the nice parts about Rust has been how it's livened
                    up discussions," before acknowledging, "some of the
                    arguments get nasty, and people do actually - yes - decide
                    'this is not worth my time,' but at the same time it's kind
                    of interesting, and I think it shows how much people care."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "C is, in the end, a very simple language. It's one of the
                    reasons I enjoy C and why a lot of C programmers enjoy C,
                    even if the other side of that picture is obviously that
                    because it's simple it's also very easy to make mistakes,"
                    he argued.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With impressive diplomacy, considering his

                    >
                    of years past, Torvalds went on, "There's a lot of people
                    who are used to the C model, and they don't necessarily like
                    the differences... and that's ok.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Some people care about specific architectures, and some
                    people like file systems, and that's how it should be.
                    That's how I see Rust."

                    Brazil. The Brazilian Supreme Court confirmed the compliance
                    in its own filing Saturday, though it noted X has yet to
                    file the proper documents to move forward with its case and
                    will have five days to do so, the Times reported. André
                    Zonaro Giacchetta, one of X's new lawyers in Brazil, told
                    the Times the conditions for X's return in Brazil "have
                    already been met, but it depends on the assessment of" the
                    country's supreme court.

                  <p>
                    Like many people who solder regularly, I decided years ago
                    to upgrade from a basic iron and invest in a soldering
                    station. My RadioShack digital station has served me well
                    for the better part of 20 years. It heats up fast, tips are
                    readily available, and it's a breeze to dial in whatever
                    temperature I need. It's older than both of my children, has
                    moved with me to three different homes, and has outlived two
                    cars and one marriage (so far, anyway).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As such, when the new breed of "smart" USB-C soldering irons
                    started hitting the scene, I didn't find them terribly
                    compelling. Oh sure, I bought a Pinecil. But that's because
                    I'm an unrepentant open source zealot and love the idea that
                    there's a soldering iron running a community developed
                    firmware. In practice though, I only used the thing a few
                    times, and even then it was because I needed something
                    portable. Using it at home on the workbench? It just never
                    felt up to the task of daily use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So when iFixit got in contact a couple weeks back and said
                    they had a prototype USB-C soldering iron they wanted me to
                    take a look at, I was skeptical to say the least. But then I
                    started reading over the documentation they sent over, and
                    couldn't deny that they had some interesting ideas. For one,
                    it was something of a hybrid iron. It was portable when you
                    needed it to be, yet offered the flexibility and power of a
                    station when you were at the bench.

                    On Tuesday, Chief US District Judge Robert Shelby granted a

                    from limiting the social media usage of minors. Republican
                    Governor Spencer Cox had signed the Utah Minor Protection in
                    Social Media Act earlier in March. It was supposed to take
                    effect on October 1, but the court’s decision to block the
                    law is a victory for young social media users in Utah.

                    create social media accounts, and these accounts had
                    limitations like curfews and age verification. He

                    Under the law, social media companies would have been forced
                    to verify the age of all users. If a minor registers for an
                    account, they are subject to various limitations. The
                    content they share would be seen only by connected accounts.
                    Additionally, minor accounts could not be searched for or
                    messaged by non-followers or friends, effectively
                    nonexistent to strangers.

                    professor of marketing at the University of Toronto's Rotman
                    School of Management. With a scientist's tools, he's done
                    what previous theorizers have failed to: put theory to the
                    test and demonstrate the key factor for empirically
                    predicting which stories will be snore fests and which will
                    leave audiences hungry for more.

                    It turns out to be "narrative reversals" -- lots of them and
                    the bigger the better. Commonly known as changes of fortune
                    or turning points, where characters' fortunes swing from
                    good to bad and vice versa, Prof. Knight and fellow
                    researchers found that stories rich in these mechanisms
                    boosted popularity and engagement with audiences through a
                    range of media, from television to crowdfunding pitches.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The best-written stories were always either 'building up' a
                    current reversal, or introducing a new plot point," says
                    Prof. Knight. "In our analysis, the best writers were those
                    that were able to maintain both many plot points and strong
                    build-up for each plot point across the course of the
                    narrative."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers analyzed nearly 30,000 television shows,
                    movies, novels, and crowdfunding pitches using computational
                    linguistics, a blend of computer science and language
                    analysis. This allowed them to quantify not only the number
                    of a reversals in a text but also their degree or intensity
                    by assigning numerical values to words based on how positive
                    or negative they were.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Movies and television shows with more and bigger reversals

                    with the most and biggest reversals were downloaded more
                    than twice as much as books with the fewest reversals from
                    the free online library Project Gutenberg. And GoFundMe
                    pitches with more and larger reversals were more likely to
                    hit their fundraising goal, by as much as 39 per cent.

                    The Greek philosopher Aristotle was the first to identify
                    peripeteia, the sudden reversal of circumstances, as a key
                    feature of a good story. Other thinkers have added their
                    ideas since then, including American playwright and
                    dramaturg Leon Katz whose scholarship particularly inspired
                    Prof. Knight's research. Katz "described the reversal as the
                    basic unit of narrative, just as a sentence is the basic
                    unit of a paragraph, or the syllogism is the basic unit of a
                    logical proof," says Prof. Knight.

                    In addition to helping psychologists understand how
                    narrative works to educate, inform and inspire people, the
                    findings may also benefit storytellers of all kinds.

                    "Hopefully our research can help build a pedagogy for
                    writers that allows them to rely on the accumulated
                    knowledge of Aristotle et al. without having to 'reinvent
                    the wheel' on their own every time," says Prof. Knight.

                    [...] When Constellation signaled interest in restarting
                    Three Mile Island in July, doubts surfaced about the
                    technical feasibility of the project. Not only would it be
                    the first of its kind, but it will have to be accomplished
                    next to another reactor whose clean-up and decommissioning
                    is expected to continue through 2078.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The site also remains politically contentious due to the
                    lasting memory of the 1979 accident, which displaced
                    surrounding communities and left a legacy of fear over
                    whether the radiation released contributed to increased
                    cancer rates in the vicinity. About 2 million people were
                    exposed to radioactive fallout as a result of the meltdown.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Public health researchers from Temple, Penn State and the
                    University of Pittsburgh published a report last year
                    finding that long-term studies into the impact of the
                    meltdown were limited by research flaws.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite these concerns, Constellation cited a statewide poll
                    showing strong support for restarting Three Mile Island. The
                    poll conducted by Susquehanna Polling &amp; Research found
                    Pennsylvania residents approve of restarting Three Mile
                    Island by more than 2-1 and 70% favor the ongoing use of
                    nuclear energy in the state.

                    Thousands of lives could be saved around the world after NHS
                    scientists discovered a new blood group system - solving a
                    50-year-old mystery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research team, led by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT)
                    scientists in South Gloucestershire and supported by the
                    University of Bristol, found a blood group called MAL.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They identified the genetic background of the previously
                    known AnWj blood group antigen, which was discovered in 1972
                    but unknown until now after this world-first test was
                    developed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Senior research scientist at NHSBT Louise Tilley said the
                    discovery means better care to rare patients can be offered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ms Tilley, who has worked on the project for 20 years, told
                    the BBC it is "quite difficult to a put a number" on how
                    many people will benefit from the test. However, the NHSBT
                    is the last resort for about 400 patients across the world
                    each year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Everyone has proteins outside their red blood cells known as
                    antigens, but a small number might lack them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using genetic testing, NHSBT's International Blood Group
                    Reference Laboratory in Filton have for the first time
                    developed a test that will identify patients missing this
                    antigen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The test could prove a lifesaver for those who would react
                    against a blood transfusion, and will make it easier to find
                    potential blood developers for this rare blood type.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Philip Brown, who works at the laboratory, was diagnosed
                    with a form of leukaemia about 20 years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He had blood transfusions and a bone marrow transplant -
                    without that, he would have died.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Anything we can do to make our blood much safer and a
                    better match for patients is a definite step in the right
                    direction," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Head of the laboratory Nicole Thornton said: "Resolving the
                    genetic basis for AnWj has been one of our most challenging
                    projects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There is so much work that goes into proving that a gene
                    does actually encode a blood group antigen, but it is what
                    we are passionate about, making these discoveries for the
                    benefit of rare patients around the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Now genotyping tests can be designed to identify
                    genetically AnWj-negative patients and donors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Such tests can be added to the existing genotyping
                    platforms."

                The result, due to an ongoing effort of just over 20 years, now
                allows for the all developers and users to utilize real-time
                computing without having to target a completely separate OS.
                Embedded systems and live processing will likely see more
                immediate improvements. This support is limited to X86, X86_64,
                ARM64, and RISCV and only capable of hard real time on hardware
                that supports it. However, the new competition and interest will
                likely spur on more developments in Real-Time Computing the
                future.

                One final note is that enabling PREEMPT_RT is not a panacea
                leading to better performance. Real time computing and real-time
                OSes sacrifice maximum throughput for guaranteed latency with
                minimal jitter. Real time does not mean "as fast as possible."
                Real time means "not too slow." In the wrong situation, it can
                actually make your performance worse.

                    The search for the energy of the future continues in all
                    parts of the world, from Antarctica to outer space (yes,
                    also outside our planet). However, it seems that this new
                    race has been won by America, where we have found what all
                    countries are looking for: this is the region that is going
                    to earn trillions of dollars for the energy of the future:
                    the enigmatic golden hydrogen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The United States has recently, as you know discovered rich
                    hydrogen resources within the country that would alter the
                    current energy situation. The use of hydrogen is gradually
                    becoming an indispensable measure in the shift towards the
                    non-utilization of fossil resources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The DoE has noted massive under ground pool of hydrogen
                    energy in various places across the country. Hydrogen, the
                    first, lightest element on the periodic table of elements,
                    is the most abundant element in the universe and yet, the
                    discovery of hydrogen in concentrated form in this planet
                    has been a task.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    New assessments hence show the prospect that these domestic
                    supplies can be used to fuel automobiles, factories and even
                    electrification. Promising innovation and development in
                    infrastructure, hydrogen is capable of powering America's
                    tomorrow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists in United States have found that there exist very
                    huge resources of hydrogen gaseous fuel trapped beneath the
                    surface of the earth, that can sustain all consumers for
                    hundreds of years. The Department of Energy has claimed that
                    the resources of hydrogen in some parts of the country to be
                    in trillions of dollars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This natural hydrogen was generated through geo-chemical
                    processes, it has been confined within underlying rocks and
                    sediments. Though hydrogen is present in immensely massive
                    quantities in the universe, localized, denser sources here
                    on Earth are relatively scarce.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If one uses the correct technology then one can know that
                    this enormous source of clean energy could fuel the society
                    for ages. A key advantage here is that the hydrogen does not
                    have to be produced, which means there is no environmental
                    and economic cost associated with its production.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Accessing these hydrogen resources is one of the prospects
                    for shifting the oil and gas industry to a new level of
                    energy production. However, it must be noted that there are
                    technical issues that can be associated with scaling of
                    hydrogen release and the efficient harvesting of hydrogen in
                    a safe and sustainable manner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Signs of huge deposits of hydrogen have known to exist
                    underground in different sedimentary basins in the United
                    States of America. They contain the world's largest deposits
                    mainly in the western part of the USA in Texas, New Mexico,
                    Utah and Colorado.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These areas contain trillions of cubic feet of hydrogen gas
                    dislocated in rock structures at depths of the earth crust.
                    These hydrogen sources were generated from deposits of
                    natural gas that over millions of years interacted with
                    water and rock to create whatis referred to as hydrostatic
                    hydrogen or hydrostatic pressure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The largest Onshore Basin in the View of Oil and Gas
                    Resources is the Gulf Coast Basin which Texas possesses some
                    of the greatest extents. San Juan Basin is endowed with the
                    major natural resources in New Mexico. Another region that
                    holds extensive amounts is the Uinta Basin of Utah.
