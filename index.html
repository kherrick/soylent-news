                <div>
                  <p>
                    For centuries, a prevailing theory in philosophy has
                    asserted that at birth the human mind is a blank slate. More
                    recently, the same notion has also held sway in the field of
                    neurobiology, where it is commonly held that neural
                    connections are slowly created from scratch with the
                    accumulation of sensory information and experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eventually, the theory goes, this allows us to create
                    memories in space and time and to then learn from those
                    experiences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But after spending more than a decade studying activity in
                    the hippocampus, the area of brain which forms memory,
                    Yale's George Dragoi began to have his doubts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In his research on the hippocampus of rodents, Dragoi, an
                    associate professor of psychiatry and of neuroscience, has
                    found that early in life there emerge in this part of the
                    brain individual functional clusters of cells (and, soon
                    after, short sequences of cells) that predictably will be
                    activated by new experiences. Within days of birth, he
                    found, these cells, clusters, and short sequences become the
                    foundation for increasingly complex sequences of cell
                    assemblies that allow for the creation of memories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new article
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-023-00763-0"
                      >published</a
                    >
                    in the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Dragoi makes the
                    case that the human brain also develops a cellular template
                    soon after birth which defines who we are and how we
                    perceive the world. He describes it as "the generative
                    grammar" of the brain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Neurons organize like letters, then words, then sentences
                    and paragraphs which allow for the internalization of the
                    outside world," Dragoi said. "The brain has its own built-in
                    sense of grammar."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea, he admits, runs counter to the tenets of
                    empiricism, a centuries-old theory that all knowledge is
                    derived from sensory experience. It also contradicts widely
                    held assumption by life scientists that environmental
                    stimuli will entirely dictate how the brain processes and
                    stores information.

                    Logo text More than a decade ago, the normalization of tech
                    companies carrying content created by news organizations
                    without directly paying them — cannibalizing readership and
                    ad revenue — precipitated the decline of the media industry.
                    With the rise of generative artificial intelligence, those
                    same firms threaten to further tilt the balance of power
                    between Big Tech and news.

                  <p>
                    On Wednesday, lawmakers in the Senate Judiciary Committee
                    referenced their failure to adopt legislation that would've
                    barred the exploitation of content by Big Tech in backing
                    proposals that would require AI companies to strike
                    licensing deals with news organizations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and chair of the
                    committee, joined several other senators in supporting calls
                    for a licensing regime and to establish a framework
                    clarifying that intellectual property laws don't protect AI
                    companies using copyrighted material to build their
                    chatbots.

                    [...] The fight over the legality of AI firms eating content
                    from news organizations without consent or compensation is
                    split into two camps: Those who believe the practice is
                    protected under the "fair use" doctrine in intellectual
                    property law that allows creators to build upon copyrighted
                    works, and those who argue that it constitutes copyright
                    infringement. Courts are currently wrestling with the issue,
                    but an answer to the question is likely years away. In the
                    meantime, AI companies continue to use copyrighted content
                    as training materials, endangering the financial viability
                    of media in a landscape in which readers can bypass direct
                    sources in favor of search results generated by AI tools.

                    from The New York Times, filed last month, pulled back the
                    curtain behind negotiations over the price and terms of
                    licensing its content. Before suing, it said that it had
                    been talking for months with OpenAI and Microsoft about a
                    deal, though the talks reached no such truce. In the
                    backdrop of AI companies crawling the internet for
                    high-quality written content, news organizations have been
                    backed into a corner, having to decide whether to accept
                    lowball offers to license their content or expend the time
                    and money to sue in a lawsuit. Some companies, like Axel
                    Springer, took the money.

                The OpenWRT project is turning 20 years old this year. During
                that time they have adapted to existing hardware products. Now

                    It is not [a] new [idea]. We first spoke about this during
                    the OpenWrt Summits in 2017 and also 2018. It became clear
                    start of December 2023 while tinkering with Banana Pi style
                    devices that they are already pretty close to what we wanted
                    to achieve in '17/'18. Banana PIs have grown in popularity
                    within the community. They boot using a self compiled
                    Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A)and upstream U-Boot (thx
                    MTK/Daniel) and some of the boards are already fully
                    supported by the upstream Linux kernel. The only nonopen
                    sourcecomponents are the 2.5 GbE PHYandWi-Fi firmware
                    blobsrunning on separate cores that areindependent of the
                    main SoC running Linuxand the DRAM calibration routines
                    which are executed early during boot.

                    I contacted three project members (pepe2k, dangole, nbd) on
                    December 6th to outline the overall idea. We went over
                    several design proposals, At the beginning we focused on the
                    most powerful (and expensive) configurations possible but
                    finally ended up with something rather simple and above
                    all,feasible. We would like to propose the following as our
                    "first" community driven HW platform called "OpenWrt
                    One/AP-24.XY".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Together with pepe2k (thx a lot) I discussed this for many
                    hours and we worked out the following project proposal.
                    Instead of going insane with specifications, we decided to
                    include some nice features we believe all OpenWrt supported
                    platforms should have (e.g. being almost unbrickablewith
                    multiple recovery options, hassle-free system console
                    access, on-board RTC with battery backup etc.).
                  </p>
                  <p>This is our first design, so let's KiSS!</p>

                The preliminary hardware specifications are included in the
                message and it will contain a pair of flash chips for redundancy
                with the aim to make the router harder to accidentally brick
                during an update.

                    The belief that all fingerprints are unique is so well
                    accepted that crime novels and TV shows riff on it. Recent
                    AI research has challenged this notion, at least regarding
                    the fingerprints on different fingers of the same person.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Undergrad researchers at Columbia Engineering
                    <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1030475"

                    that while the branching and endpoints in the fingerprint
                    ridges might vary, the angles and curvature at the center of
                    the fingerprint could be the same across an individual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To determine this, the students used a deep contrastive
                    network and a US government database of 60,000 fingerprints
                    to study commonalities in fingerprints. They fed pairs of
                    prints to a neural network, with some coming from the same
                    person and others from different individuals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The network eventually became able to identify if prints
                    were from the same person to an accuracy of 77 percent. That
                    accuracy increased when multiple pairs of prints were
                    presented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team initially had no idea how the network was able to
                    identify whether the prints belonged to the same person. To
                    the human eye, the fingerprints certainly did not appear
                    similar.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In order to understand that it was merely identifying the
                    angles and starting points of the ridges, they had to study
                    the AI system's decision process. Thus, the team concluded
                    that the AI was using an unexpected forensic marker.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As it turns out, humans can be so set in their processes not
                    only when it comes to identifying prints but also
                    identifying science. The first journal the team submitted
                    their results to rejected them with the conclusion: "It is
                    well known that every fingerprint is unique," according to

                Windows isn't even telling users the correct error. Microsoft
                claims the update is failing on systems where the recovery
                partition isn't large enough. From my own experience, I have
                systems where I allowed the Windows installer to partition the
                drive automatically, meaning that Windows determined the size of
                the recovery partition. Windows 10 chose a size of 509 MB on my
                systems, and this doesn't seem to be scaled depending on the
                size of the user's drive. For most users, this is probably set
                automatically by the installer or the computer manufacturer.
                That said, I've read a user comment that the update

                  >manually resize the recovery partition</a
                >. The commands are not intuitive, and there's absolutely no
                reason that Microsoft should be expecting ordinary users to be
                doing this. Resizing partitions is a fairly high risk operation,
                one that carries a risk of data loss if not done properly.

                This vulnerability probably just isn't a risk at all for most
                users, but that's not necessarily obvious. They just see the
                message that a security update failed with a cryptic error
                message. It's Microsoft's responsibility to ensure that security
                updates just work when they're being installed on a system in a
                reasonably standard configuration. If the Windows installer
                chose a recovery partition of 509 MB, then Microsoft needs to
                make their updates work with a recovery partition of that size,
                or they need to automatically resize the partition. This is a
                dumpster fire, and it's inexcusable to expect Microsoft to
                expect users to manually repartition their drives.

                    A recent investigation undertaken by Pesticide Action
                    Network (PAN) revealed that the UK is still using 36 harmful
                    pesticides that have been banned in other European
                    countries, with 13 described as "highly hazardous" that have

                    completed a successful field trial of a material they have
                    developed to help to protect crops from fungi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Simon Avery, professor of eukaryotic microbiology in the
                    Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, said, "The test
                    material is not toxic but works by passively resisting
                    attachment of fungal spores to protect surfaces from fungal
                    infection, including crop surfaces. Results from this first
                    field trial with wheat are particularly encouraging as there
                    is a lot of scope to optimize further the material
                    properties for crop protection."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We identified two lead polymer candidates by
                    bio-performance testing using in vitro microplates and
                    leaf-based assays. These were then taken forward into a
                    program to optimize and scale up their synthesis and
                    compound them into a spray formulation that could be used on
                    crops. Our findings showed that the material not only
                    significantly reduced fungal infection by the fungus
                    Septoria tritici by up to 26% but also that the crop grew
                    just as well as the control group—providing an alternative
                    that appears safer for the environment, wildlife, and
                    people, and is effective, too."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sprayed directly onto wheat at timings conventional for
                    fungicides, the trial has provided the first real-world
                    scale exemplification of how the material interacts with
                    crops. The small plot trial compared the two polymer
                    candidates to a multisite fungicide and two commercial
                    fungicide programs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Valentina said, "Our attention is now turning to a
                    second field trial that's in the diary for this year to
                    further hone and improve the polymer so we can continue
                    turning our research into reality. The beauty of a material
                    like this is its lack of toxicity, the relative simplicity
                    of its production and the fact that it can be scaled up
                    easily—making it an incredibly attractive prospect for
                    several other industries, not just agriculture."

                    of its debt-holders that will allow it to reduce its debt.
                    The company says the plan would reduce its debt by 80% from

                    Back in 2019 we noted how the streaming sector risked
                    driving consumers back to piracy if they didn't heed the
                    lessons of the past. We explored how the rush to raise
                    rates, nickel-and-dime users, implement arbitrary
                    restrictions, and force users toward hunting and pecking

                    NASA leadership is expected on Tuesday to announce a
                    "months-long delay" to the first crewed mission of the
                    agency's flagship Artemis program, according to one current
                    and one former NASA employee.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The delay affects NASA's Artemis II mission, which aims to
                    send four astronauts on a journey to fly by the moon and was
                    slated to lift off this November.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the mission is no longer expected to take place before
                    2025, according to the sources, confirming months of
                    speculation that a delay was imminent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA's Inspector General hinted at potential delays for the
                    mission in a November report, citing three main challenges
                    the space agency must address before it can safely fly
                    humans to the moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, the ground structure used to build, transport and
                    launch the program's massive Space Launch System rocket —
                    dubbed Mobile Launcher 1 — "sustained more damage than
                    expected."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The November report stated that repairs to the structure
                    were ongoing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, the heat shield on the Orion spacecraft — intended
                    to be the astronauts' home on Artemis II — "eroded in an
                    unexpected way" during Artemis I as it was exposed to
                    temperatures about half as hot as the surface of the sun
                    upon reentry into Earth's atmosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, the Inspector General noted what NASA officials
                    believed to be "the primary critical path" for the Artemis
                    II mission: preparing Orion for its first crew and
                    integrating it with the European Service Module, which
                    provides power and propulsion. The "critical path" in
                    project planning refers to the aspect of the mission that's
                    expected to take the longest.

                    >, a study published in the journal <em>Blood</em> reported
                    on three unrelated people with recurrent infections and a
                    significant lack of T cells, specialized white blood cells
                    crucial to the immune system, had the same mutation that
                    hyperactivates Rac2. The study also observed that many of
                    the patient's neutrophils, cells that capture and ingest
                    invading microorganisms, were enlarged, indicating they were
                    consuming a lot of cellular material.

                  <p>
                    After reading this study, Denise Montell, who was involved
                    in the 1996 research and is the corresponding author in the
                    current study, wondered whether the T cells' disappearance
                    was due to innate immune cells with active Rac2 eating them,
                    as had happened with the fruit flies. So, Montell and the
                    other researchers turned their focus to macrophages, the
                    voracious counterpart of the neutrophil. The researchers
                    cultured human macrophages with and without hyperactive
                    Rac2, together with T cells, and found that macrophages with
                    hyperactive Rac consumed more cells, confirming their
                    hypothesis.

                    'Phoenix' lineup of APUs for its desktop AM5 PCs here at CES
                    2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada, bringing 1080p-capable integrated
                    graphics to the company's newest platform for the first
                    time, not to mention unlocking a new lower entry pricing
                    point to the AM5 ecosystem. The two flagship Ryzen 8000G
                    processors are also the world's first desktop CPUs with an
                    integrated high-performance Neural Processing Unit (NPU)
                    engine to boost performance in AI workloads, beating Intel
                    to the punch again — AMD was also the first x86 chipmaker to
                    bring an NPU to laptops. Now, they've come to the desktop

                    AMD's new Ryzen AI Software suite is designed to allow both
                    enthusiasts and developers to deploy pre-trained AI models
                    on its silicon with a one-click approach that greatly
                    simplifies the process. Users can select machine learning
                    models trained on frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow and
                    use AMD's Vitis AI quantizer to quantize the model into an
                    ONNX format. The software then partitions and compiles the
                    model, which runs on the Ryzen NPU. The Ryzen AI Software is
                    available now for free, and AMD also has a pre-optimized
                    model zoo on Hugging Face available.

                    used hearing aids had a 24% lower risk of mortality than

                    plans—and also said the plans wouldn't work for the US,
                    anyway. "Bulk importation will not provide an effective
                    solution to the problem of high drug prices in the US,"

                    >, claiming the drug imports will save the state "up to $180
                    million in the first year alone." There are caveats, though.
                    Before Florida can import any drugs, it must complete
                    several obligations, including submitting to the FDA
                    additional drug-specific information, testing the drugs for
                    authenticity and FDA compliance, and relabeling them in
                    accordance with FDA labeling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The FDA authorized the importation program in accordance
                    with section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
                    (FD&amp;C Act). The move stems from President Biden's
                    "Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American
                    Economy," which directed the FDA to help develop such
                    programs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Proponents of the program in the US say that importing
                    cheaper drugs from abroad could help lower US drug prices by
                    offering more competition on the market. Canada, like other
                    countries, has lower drug prices than the US, partly because
                    the country's national health system negotiates prices for
                    prescription drugs.

                    But Canada, which has a population around nine times smaller
                    than the US, has been staunchly opposed to the US importing
                    its drugs. It has repeatedly said that diverting medicines
                    to the US could lead to drug shortages in Canada, make
                    existing shortages worse, and/or cause price spikes.

                    The ancient, palm-sized fossil is fascinating, but a common
                    household curio: Teeth from the giant extinct shark — which
                    grew around 50 feet long, which is longer than a city bus —
                    are frequently found in accessible coastal areas worldwide.
                    The sharks' huge jaws were lined with 276 teeth, and they
                    likely lost and replaced thousands over their lifetimes,
                    allowing plenty of teeth the chance to fossilize.

                    The term <em>enshittification </em>became popular in 2023
                    after it was used in a blog post by author Cory Doctorow,
                    who used it to describe how digital platforms can become
                    worse and worse. "Here is how platforms die: first, they are
                    good to their users; then they abuse their users to make
                    things better for their business customers; finally, they
                    abuse those business customers to claw back all the value
                    for themselves. Then, they die. I call this
                    enshittification," Doctorow wrote on his Pluralistic blog.

                    Presiding at the Jan. 6 voting session were Ben Zimmer,
                    chair of the ADS New Words Committee and language columnist
                    for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and Dr. Kelly
                    Elizabeth Wright of Virginia Tech, data czar of the New
                    Words Committee. "<em>Enshittification</em> is a sadly apt
                    term for how our online lives have become gradually
                    degraded," Zimmer said. "From the time that it first
                    appeared in Doctorow's posts and articles, the word had all
                    the markings of a successful neologism, being instantly
                    memorable and adaptable to a variety of contexts."

                    linked to your mentality. Simply put, the less you share
                    about yourself online, the less identifiable you will be.
                    That means being careful about what you post on social

                    Federal investigators have discovered a second contaminant
                    in recalled applesauce pouches — the naturally-occurring
                    metal chromium, which in a certain form can cause a number

                    The FDA has reported finding extraordinarily high levels of
                    lead in samples of cinnamon from the Ecuador plant where the
                    pouches were made. On Friday, the agency reported it had
                    also found chromium. Chromium is an

                    >
                    found in foods and dietary supplements, but in one form —
                    called chromium-6 — it can cause harm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Lead chromate, which contains the potentially toxic
                    chromium-6, has been used in the past to enhance the
                    coloring of

                      >turmeric</a
                    >. Federal investigators say the "lead-to-chromium ratio" in
                    the applesauce pouches "is consistent with that of lead
                    chromate."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But investigators said the chromium in lead chromate
                    may be converted to the less toxic form chromium-3, "due to
                    the acidity of the applesauce and the stomach."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Michael Beuhler, the medical director of North Carolina
                    Poison Control, said the discovery of chromium in the
                    applesauce and cinnamon does not necessarily mean the
                    substance will cause harm. He said that "at the levels we're
                    talking about," he doesn't believe there would be much
                    chromium-6 in the pouches. Any chromium-6 that might have
                    been present would probably reduce to a nontoxic form once
                    inside the applesauce pouches, he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said lead chromate could have been added as a powder to
                    cinnamon to affect the weight and color of the spice. Lead
                    chromate can be more than six times heavier than cinnamon,
                    he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I don't believe that this is any cause for additional
                    alarm," Beuhler said. "But it does suggest why it happened."

                    Anyone following the fusion news out of LLNL knows that,
                    while the X-ray beam that hit the fusion fuel pellet – a
                    diamond-encased, pea sized lump of deuterium and tritium –
                    may have delivered 2.05 megajoules of energy to the pellet
                    and produced 3.15 megajoules, it took far more energy than
                    that to get the whole thing accomplished.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fuel pellet sits inside a cylindrical chamber known as a
                    hohlraum, which converts laser energy into X-rays that
                    ignite the pellet. Those lasers output 322 megajoules of
                    energy – all but 2.05 mj of which is lost in the conversion
                    to X-rays.

                    In essence, Edwards said, the whole system only has an
                    efficiency of around 1 percent, but that could change in
                    2024.

                    [...] For starters, using laser fusion to generate power
                    means shooting fuel pellets somewhere in the neighborhood of
                    one to ten times every second – instead of once a month like
                    the NIF.

                    That means mass production of targets, a method of
                    extracting energy from said targets, and a reliable method
                    of scaling the entire system. In other words, developing an
                    entire framework for an integrated fusion plant – which will
                    be a major part of LLNL's work in the coming year and

                  installing a backdoor into her secure messaging program, the
                  agent did not know what he was in for</a
                >:

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    At a recent RSA Security Conference, Nico Sell was on stage
                    announcing that her company—Wickr—was making drastic changes
                    to ensure its users' security. She said that the company
                    would switch from RSA encryption to
                    <a
                      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman"
                      >elliptic curve encryption</a
                    >, and that the service wouldn't have a backdoor for anyone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As she left the stage, before she'd even had a chance to
                    take her microphone off, a man approached her and introduced
                    himself as an agent with the Federal Bureau of
                    Investigation. He then proceeded to "casually" ask if she'd
                    be willing to install a backdoor into Wickr that would allow
                    the FBI to retrieve information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This encounter, and the agent's casual demeanor, is
                    apparently business as usual as intelligence and law
                    enforcement agencies seek to gain greater access into
                    protected communication systems. Since her encounter with
                    the agent at RSA, Sell says it's a story she's heard again
                    and again. "It sounds like that's how they do it now," she
                    told SecurityWatch. "Always casual, testing, because most
                    people would say yes."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It was clear that the FBI agent didn't know who he was
                    dealing with, because Sell did not back down. Instead, she
                    lectured him on topics ranging from the First and Fourth
                    Amendments to the Constitution, to George Washington's
                    creation of a Post Office in the US. "My ancestor was a
                    drummer boy under Washington," Sell explained. "Washington
                    thought it was very important to have freedom of information
                    and private correspondence without government surveillance."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Her lecture concluded, she proceeded to grill the agent. "I
                    asked if he had official paperwork for me, if this was an
                    official request, who his boss was," said Sell. "He backed
                    down very quickly."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Though she didn't budge for the agent, Sell makes it clear
                    that surveillance and security is a complicated issue. "Ten
                    years ago, I'd have said yes," said Sell. "Because if law
                    enforcement asks you to catch bad guys, who wouldn't want to
                    help?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The difference now, she explained, was her experiences at
                    BlackHat. Among those, Sell pointed to a BlackHat event
                    where
                    <a
                      href="http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-10/Cross_Tom/BlackHat-DC-2010-Cross-Attacking-LawfulI-Intercept-wp.pdf"

                    how to break into lawful intercept machines—or wiretaps. "It
                    was very clear that a backdoor for the good guys is always a
                    backdoor for the bad guys."

                    Most message apps tout their privacy features in some way.
                    It is common to hear marketing language about "end-to-end
                    encryption" and "private messaging" for basically every
                    communications app out there.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While it's great that encryption has become a selling point
                    for the public, not every "encrypted messaging service" is
                    made equally. Depending on how it is set up, your message
                    app may leak metadata, contacts, and even message contents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A recently uncovered FBI document obtained by a group called
                    Property of the People and shared with Rolling Stone
                    illustrates just how important your choice of private
                    messenger can be. If you think popular options like Apple's
                    iMessage and the Meta company formerly known as Facebook's
                    WhatsApp are FBI-proof, think again. The nation's top cops
                    can obtain a host of message information on many popular
                    options including some mix of "subscriber data, message
                    sender-receiver data, device backup, IP address, encryption
                    keys, date/time information, registration time data, and
                    user contacts."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Nine popular messaging applications are included in
                    the document: Apple's iMessage; Line, a Japanese message
                    app; Signal, an open source encrypted chat platform
                    popularized by Edward Snowden; Telegram, which originated in
                    Russia and is now based in Dubai; Threema, a paid encryption
                    chat (that I used to use) with servers based in Switzerland;
                    Viber, which was developed in Cyprus and then bought by the
                    Japanese conglomerate Rakuten; the Chinese Swiss army knife
                    app WeChat; Meta's WhatsApp; and Wickr [Me], which is a chat
                    service that Amazon Web Services apparently owns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The bottom line: of the most popular apps, iMessage and
                    WhatsApp are particularly susceptible to FBI snooping.
                    Telegram and Signal score far better according to the FBI
                    documents. (Line and Viber are also relatively bad picks,
                    and my formerly favored Threema likewise fares more poorly
                    than I'd have expected, but since they aren't as popular
                    this probably isn't relevant for you.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Now to the encryption winners. It's no surprise that
                    Signal fared well against favored FBI methods. It's open
                    source, independent (albeit with some surprising
                    partnerships), and touted by public personalities with
                    privacy-focused bonafides. Still, I would have expected the
                    FBI to have access to more metadata than they apparently do.
                    Way to go, Signal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Telegram especially surprised me for scoring so well.
                    End-to-end encryption is not the default for most Telegram
                    communications. You need to select a "secret chat" with an
                    individual to get the full-bodied protection that the FBI
                    document seems to indicate. Groups chats, which is the
                    method preferred of many Telegram users, do not offer the
                    same level of end-to-end encryption. Neither the FBI
                    document nor the Rolling Stone article makes mention of
                    this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Weirdly, Rolling Stone does not mention Telegram at all,
                    despite being the apparently most FBI-proof application all
                    around and much more popular than Wickr, which does get a
                    nod. The FBI document does note that Telegram may choose to
                    divulge IP addresses and phone numbers for "confirmed
                    terrorist investigations," but it cites Telegram's public
                    policy rather than any secret backchannel.

                    saying the company would be grounding its fleet of 65 Boeing
                    737-9 aircraft for what it expects to be a few days as it
                    conducts safety checks. “Each aircraft will be returned to
                    service only after completion of full maintenance and safety
                    inspections,” Minicucci. The FAA order extends the grounding
                    to “approximately 171 airplanes worldwide” that are either
                    operated by US airlines or in US territory.

                    “we will fully support their investigation.” The plane had

                    One of the greatest challenges of modern physics is to find
                    a coherent method for describing phenomena, on the cosmic
                    and microscale. For over a hundred years, to describe
                    reality on a cosmic scale we have been using general
                    relativity theory, which has successfully undergone repeated
                    attempts at falsification.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Albert Einstein curved space-time to describe gravity, and
                    despite still-open questions about dark matter or dark
                    energy, it seems, today, to be the best method of analyzing
                    the past and future of the universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To describe phenomena on the scale of atoms, we use the
                    second great theory: quantum mechanics, which differs from
                    general relativity in basically everything. It uses flat
                    space-time and a completely different mathematical
                    apparatus, and most importantly, perceives reality radically
                    differently.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the quantum description, the phenomena around us are only
                    wavering probabilities of events that we can only measure
                    with limited accuracy.

                    that there is a method that combines the above descriptions,

                    India's solar observation mission on Saturday entered the
                    Sun's orbit after a four-month journey, the latest success
                    for the space exploration ambitions of the world's most
                    populous nation.

                    The Aditya-L1 mission was launched in September and is
                    carrying an array of instruments to measure and observe the
                    Sun's outermost layers.

                  <p>
                    India's science and technology minister Jitendra Singh said
                    on social media that the probe had reached its final orbit
                    "to discover the mysteries of Sun-Earth connection".

                  <p>
                    [...] But the latest mission by the Indian Space Research
                    Organization is the first by any Asian nation to be placed
                    in orbit around the Sun.

                    [...] Aditya, named after a Hindu Sun deity, has traveled
                    1.5 million kilometers (932,000 miles) from the Earth—still
                    only one percent of the distance between humanity's home
                    planet and the star at the center of our solar system.

                    It is now at a point where the gravitational forces of both
                    celestial bodies cancel out, allowing it to remain in a
                    stable halo orbit around the Sun.

                    The orbiter, which reportedly cost $48 million, will study
                    coronal mass ejections, a periodic phenomenon that sees huge
                    discharges of plasma and magnetic energy from the Sun's
                    atmosphere.

                    [...] India has a comparatively low-budget space program,
                    but one that has grown considerably in size and momentum
                    since it first sent a probe to orbit the Moon in 2008.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In August last year, India became the first country to land
                    an uncrewed craft near the largely unexplored lunar south
                    pole, and just the fourth nation to land on the Moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    India became the first Asian nation to put a craft into
                    orbit around Mars in 2014, and it is slated to launch a
                    three-day crewed mission into Earth's orbit later this year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It also plans a joint mission with Japan to send another
                    probe to the Moon by 2025 and an orbital mission to Venus
                    within the next two years.

                    CES is about more than just the gadgets you hold in your
                    hand or sit at the desk to use. It's about the stuff in your
                    bathroom, too, which is why Kohler is using the annual trade
                    show to debut its latest in connected fixtures. The new
                    items include a new shower sprayer, a ventilation fan that
                    helps with humidity after a long shower, and my favorite,
                    the PureWash Bidet Seat with Google and Alexa built-in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The PureWash Bidet Seat is as standard as any other, but I
                    like that you can talk to it. It's heated, has adjustable
                    temperatures and water pressure, and comes in white or black
                    to match your bathroom style. It also features voice
                    activation via Amazon's Alexa or the Google Assistant. You
                    can use your voice to command the spray pressure and the air
                    dryer—it has a dryer! Ahhh, nice and warm.
                  </p>

                    [...] Kohler will have other fixtures on display at CES,
                    including the Rista, a 3D-printed sink. I also hope to
                    glimpse the new Anthem+ Smart Showering controls, which
                    offer remote access to lights, water, and sound through the
                    Kohler Konnect app.

                      Two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials have proved
                      to be very promising for the development of various
                      electronic devices, including wearables and smaller
                      electronics. These materials can have significant
                      advantages over their bulky counterparts, for instance
                      retaining their carrier mobility irrespective of their
                      reduced thickness.

                      Despite their promise for creating thin electronics, 2D
                      semiconductors have so far only rarely been used to create
                      monolayer transistors, thinner versions of the crucial
                      electronic components used to modulate and amplify
                      electrical current inside most existing devices. Most
                      proposed monolayer transistors based on 2D semiconductors
                      were created using a few carefully selected materials
                      known to have relatively stable lattice structures, such
                      as graphene, tungsten diselenide or molybdenum disulfide
                      (MoS2).

                      new monolayer transistors using alternative 2D

                      phosphorus and germanium arsenide—the fabrication of
                      monolayer transistors is challenging and is limited by the
                      difficulties in forming robust electrical contacts with
                      the delicate 2D materials," Wangying Li, Quanyang Tao and
                      their colleagues wrote in their paper. "We report the
                      fabrication of monolayer black phosphorus and germanium
                      arsenide transistors with three-dimensional raised
                      contacts using a van der Waals peeling technique."

                      The primary objective of the recent work by this team of
                      researchers was to create new transistors based on
                      monolayer 2D semiconductors beyond those that have so far
                      been primarily used in monolayer transistor designs. This
                      presents several challenges, as some of these materials
                      are difficult to scale down uniformly and without
                      compromising their intrinsic properties.

                      [...] Though the Romans consumed even more wine than we do
                      today, ancient vineyards in Italy looked radically
                      different from the typical landscape of rolling hillsides
                      covered by rows of tightly spaced vines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      [...] But the sophistication of the system goes much
                      further. By training vines to climb high—up to 15 or even
                      20 meters—the damage done by rising soil dampness was
                      further reduced, while the heating impact of the sun was
                      increased. This made grapes develop and mature better, as
                      long as the right balance between shade (from foliage) and
                      sun exposure was obtained. High climbing vines also have
                      deeper and more developed roots, which makes them more
                      resistant to rot caused by parasites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Examples in pre industrial Portugal also show that the
                      trees themselves even contribute to the microclimate of
                      the vineyard: they mitigate the impact of winter frosts,
                      offer protection against strong and damaging winds, and
                      reduce the distribution of unwanted seeds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Records show that vine agroforestery expanded massively
                      between the years 200 BC and 200 AD, during what is known
                      as the Roman Climate Optimum, a period of several
                      centuries of markedly warmer temperatures that coincided
                      with the expansion of the Roman Empire. This means that
                      Roman winemakers in Italy often operated under warmer and
                      more humid conditions than those experienced in much of
                      the 20th century.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      [...] Insights into Roman and pre-industrial practices
                      suggest that this approach may also help winemakers to
                      adapt to an ever-warming planet. It also begs the much
                      wider question of what else we can learn by looking to the
                      past as we confront an uncertain future.

                    On Monday, January 8, United Launch Alliance's Vulcan
                    Centaur could finally perform its first flight. ULA has been
                    a rock in the spaceflight industry since its founding in
                    2006, and with this pending launch, the company is ready to
                    take its next bold step into space. Here's how America's new
                    powerhouse rocket could disrupt the sector and compete with
                    the ever-dominant SpaceX.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Vulcan Centaur rocket, towering at 202 feet (61.6
                    meters), is scheduled for liftoff from Cape Canaveral's
                    Space Launch Complex-41. ULA, a collaboration between
                    Lockheed Martin Corporation and Boeing Company, hasn't
                    created a rocket that compares technologically to those
                    belonging to SpaceX, but it still represents a big
                    achievement for the company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Vulcan Centaur could make serious waves in the spaceflight

                      >ULA potentially matching SpaceX's lower launch prices</a
                    >, according to the Motley Fool. SpaceX, known for
                    revolutionizing space travel with affordable launches like
                    the $67 million Falcon 9, prompted ULA to respond with a
                    more affordable option. Vulcan, set to launch at under $100
                    million, marks a substantial cost reduction from the
                    company's $400 million Delta IV Heavy. This strategic
                    pricing means ULA can stay somewhat competitive,
                    demonstrated by its
                    <a

                  <p>
                    While this might mean lower revenues for Boeing and Lockheed
                    Martin, the Vulcan Centaur's cost-effectiveness could prove
                    beneficial in the long term. This development
                    signals—hopefully—a tightening competition in the space
                    launch sector. What's more, customers must weigh other
                    considerations beyond just launch costs, such as fairing
                    adaptability and the increasing issue of backlogs. Needless
                    to say, the introduction of SpaceX's Starship megarocket
                    could complicate the landscape for ULA, but only time will
                    tell.

                needed to reach a skill level where one can play as long as
                endurance and the software hold out. In his case it took over
                half an hour on the NES using rolling:

                    Blue Scuti is a Tetris prodigy who employs the "rolling"
                    controller technique, a new way of holding and using the NES
                    controller that was popularized in 2021. Rolling surpassed
                    "hyper tapping," which requires players to tap the
                    controller's D-pad 12 times per second, as the fastest and
                    best way of playing Tetris. Rolling is a method where
                    players roll their fingers on the bottom of an NES
                    controller and use that pressure to push the controller into
                    their other hand, which presses the D-pad to move the
                    blocks. With rolling, players can push the D-pad at least 20
                    times per second, which is fast enough to theoretically play
                    the game until it breaks. The technique has completely
                    revolutionized competitive Tetris over the last few years.

                    Rocket and satellite maker SpaceX on Wednesday was accused
                    by a U.S. labor agency of unlawfully firing eight employees
                    for circulating a letter calling founder and CEO Elon Musk a
                    "distraction and embarrassment."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A regional official with the National Labor Relations Board
                    (NLRB) issued a complaint claiming SpaceX violated the
                    workers' rights under federal labor law to band together and
                    advocate for better working conditions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The letter sent to SpaceX executives in June 2022 focused on
                    a series of tweets Musk had made since 2020, many of which
                    were sexually suggestive.

                    >
                    Musk's statements did not align with the company's policies
                    on diversity and workplace misconduct, and called on SpaceX
                    to condemn them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The complaint also accuses SpaceX of interrogating employees
                    about the letter, disparaging the workers who were involved,
                    and threatening to fire workers who engaged in similar
                    activity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The case is the latest to accuse companies run by Musk
                    of violating employees' rights under labor and employment
                    laws.

                    An incredibly early release of 86-DOS has been found,
                    imaged, and shared on the Internet Archive. The disk appears
                    to be an original release of version 0.1 C of 86-DOS from
                    Seattle Computer Products (1980) and includes several
                    utilities, along with a game. Moreover, according to the
                    disk label, what we see is just the eleventh disk off the
                    duplication line. This is an important finding, as 86-DOS is
                    a direct ancestor of PC DOS and MS-DOS.

                    on the Internet Archive’s site just ahead of the New Year.
                     We even get to see a photo of the disk in its paper sleeve,
                    where “Serial #11” can be seen printed. Before this 86-DOS
                    release was unearthed on its 5.25-inch floppy disk, the
                    earliest version that had been saved for posterity was
                    version 0.34.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] NTDEV highlights the Spartan nature of 86-DOS version
                    0.1 C. The OS is delivered as a floppy disk containing just
                    nine files. The core OS standard COMMAND.COM was included,
                    which interprets command line instructions like dir, copy,
                    clear, and format. The disk also contained utilities for
                    file and disk copying, a basic text editor, plus two or
                    three development utilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The development utilities were important to 86-DOS releases
                    as users would be short on software unless they sourced or
                    translated existing 8-bit Z80 CP/M programs for the 8086
                    architecture. Thus, there was an assembly language program
                    called ASM.COM, a code compiler app called HEX2BIN.COM, and
                    a Z80 to 8086 translator dubbed TRANS.COM.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last but not least, it is interesting to see that an OS as
                    primitive as this release included a game. CHESS.COM was
                    accompanied by instructions in CHESS.DOC, which would
                    probably be essential reading on a no-graphics rendition of
                    this complex strategic game.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To test 86-DOS yourself, you can grab the disk image
                    directly from Archive.org and then follow the instructions

                    Dr. Vinther explained, "Both arrow worms, and the more
                    primitive Timorebestia, were swimming predators. We can
                    therefore surmise that in all likelihood they were the
                    predators that dominated the oceans before arthropods took
                    off. Perhaps they had a dynasty of about 10–15 million years
                    before they got superseded by other, and more successful,
                    groups."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Our discovery firms up how arrow worms evolved,"
                    added Tae Yoon Park from the Korean Polar Research
                    Institute, the other senior author and field expedition
                    leader. "Living arrow worms have a distinct nervous center
                    on their belly, called a ventral ganglion. It is entirely
                    unique to these animals."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We are very excited to have discovered such unique
                    predators in Sirius Passet. Over a series of expeditions to
                    the very remote Sirius Passet in the furthest reaches of
                    North Greenland, more than 82,5˚ north, we have collected a
                    great diversity of exciting new organisms. Thanks to the
                    remarkable, exceptional preservation in Sirius Passet, we
                    can also reveal exciting anatomical details, including their
                    digestive system, muscle anatomy, and nervous systems."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We have many more exciting findings to share in the coming
                    years that will help show how the earliest animal ecosystems
                    looked like and evolved," Dr. Park concluded.

                    disaster, 23andMe has apparently decided to leave its
                    customers out to dry while downplaying the seriousness of

                    "Therefore, the incident was not a result of 23andMe's

                    the letter reads.

                  <p>
                    Zavareei said that 23andMe is "shamelessly" blaming the
                    victims of the data breach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This finger pointing is nonsensical. 23andMe knew or should
                    have known that many consumers use recycled passwords and
                    thus that 23andMe should have implemented some of the many
                    safeguards available to protect against credential stuffing
                    — especially considering that 23andMe stores personal
                    identifying information, health information, and genetic
                    information on its platform," Zavareei said in an email.

                    exposed through the DNA Relatives feature on 23andMe's
                    platform, not because they used recycled passwords. Of those
                    millions, only a few thousand accounts were compromised due
                    to credential stuffing. 23andMe's attempt to shirk
                    responsibility by blaming its customers does nothing for
                    these millions of consumers whose data was compromised
                    through no fault of their own whatsoever," said Zavareei.

                I'm not one of these Nancy-Boys who just downloads some binaries
                and call it an operating system. I compiled my Gentoo, right
                here on my own computer, but now that's history.
              </p>
              <p>
                In what many thought might be a prank, The geeks at Gentoo
                announced they will now offers 20-plus gigabytes of pre-compiled
                binaries, from desktops to office suites, to speed up
                installations and updates.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although this is exactly how basically all other current Linux
                distributions work, it is a significant departure for Gentoo,
                which previously was an almost entirely source-based distro.
                With Gentoo, the install disk that gets you started must by
                definition be pre-compiled, up to now, when you install Gentoo,
                it fetches the source code and compiles it on your machine for
                your machine, specifically optimized for your computer's
                specific CPU and the individual functionality and configuration
                you chose.
              </p>
              <p>
                For now, the full range of pre-compiled binary packages will
                focus on x86-64 and Arm64.

                    Researchers have taken a big step forward in the quest to
                    regenerate the pancreatic beta-cells damaged by type 1
                    diabetes. Using FDA-approved drugs usually given to patients
                    with rare cancers, they reprogrammed pancreatic cells to
                    produce and secrete insulin in response to glucose. The
                    discovery could mean that, one day, diabetics won't need to
                    take multiple daily insulin injections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pancreatic beta-cells synthesize, store and release insulin.
                    But, in type 1 diabetes (T1D), the immune system selectively
                    destroys these cells over time, leading to a lifelong
                    dependence on exogenous insulin administration for survival.
                    While insulin therapy helps control blood glucose, it
                    doesn't prevent, stop, or reverse the destruction of the
                    pancreas' insulin-secreting cells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For many years, research has focused on identifying novel
                    therapies that stimulate beta-cell growth and function to
                    restore insulin production in type 1 diabetics. Now, in an
                    exciting breakthrough, researchers at the Baker Heart and
                    Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia, have brought us
                    a step closer to making this a reality, regenerating damaged
                    pancreatic cells so they can produce insulin and
                    functionally respond to blood glucose levels.
                  </p>

                    "We consider this regenerative approach an important advance
                    towards clinical development," said Sam El-Osta, the study's
                    corresponding author. "Until now, the regenerative process

                    21 satellites overall, including "the first six Starlink

                    mobile network operators around the world to provide

                    without changing hardware or firmware. The enhanced Starlink

                    per beam and the beams are very big, so while this is a
                    great solution for locations with no cellular connectivity,
                    it is not meaningfully competitive with existing terrestrial

                    Digitization has many downsides. It puts many people at a
                    disadvantage and relegates them to the sidelines. Many
                    service providers apparently are unaware of this, or
                    consciously accept it. It disadvantages many weaker,
                    disabled, and older people. Digital devices are often more
                    difficult to use than analog ones. The more (mostly unused)
                    options, the more difficult it is.

                    The analog landline telephone is easy to use and works even
                    in the event of a power failure. Countless people are
                    overwhelmed by digital cell phones. Digitization excludes
                    many people from social or economic life. They are left
                    behind. Without computer skills, it is difficult to use
                    ticket machines, for example. Analog coffee machines,
                    washing machines, stoves, and refrigerators are more
                    user-friendly than digital ones. This is especially true for
                    radios and televisions.

                    Scientists have discovered an entirely new class of

                    Zosurabalpin defeated highly drug-resistant strains of
                    <em>Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii</em> (Crab)
                    in mouse models of pneumonia and sepsis, and was being

                    Crab is classified as a priority 1 critical pathogen by the

                    it is not an aggressive pathogen it is resistant to multiple
                    different antibiotics, making it very difficult to treat.

                    "Unfortunately, development of new treatments against this

                    adept at keeping antibiotics from getting past its outer
                    cell layer. Therefore, this work is really exciting, and
                    provides confidence that the approaches being used to find
                    new antibiotics can bear fruit."

                    anything that operates in this way, so it is unique in its

                    the public health threat of antimicrobial resistant
                    infections, the discovery could lay the foundations for
                    future efforts to drug the same transport system in other
                    bacteria.

                    [...] It is here that the nature of AI may hint at a
                    regulatory foothold in responsibly integrating machines with
                    the affairs of humanity. There is not just one AI, there are
                    multitudes of models, of hardware platforms, of approaches,
                    of experiments. They are machines, and we can make as many
                    as we need. Ultimate truth is ultimately unknowable, but a
                    workable consensus is achievable – or even a workable
                    majority.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you have a critical task where an AI is involved and
                    there's no way to immediately spot a blooper, get another
                    one in parallel. And another. Compare answers. If you can't
                    find enough independent AI for a particular problem, don't
                    use AI until you can.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Redundancy is a powerful weapon against error. Apollo got to
                    the Moon not because the systems were perfect, but because
                    they had redundancy in place in the expectation of failure.
                    The Soviet manned lunar effort eschewed that in favor of
                    what looked like expediency, but ended in ignominy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We don't have to trust AI, which is just as well – what is
                    truth? It knows no more than we do. But we have fashioned a
                    workable society around systems that trust and verify, and
                    we see this working in judges as well as jet planes. The
                    philosophy, potential, and pitfalls of our increasingly
                    thoughtful companions will work out over time, we should
                    just set the odds in our favor while we can. Whatever we do,
                    we won't be able to wash our hands of it.

                    any source. That’s what sideloading and third-party app
                    stores amount to.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google will also support third-party payment systems.
                    However, the company will still collect a fee from
                    developers for each transaction. And developers might not
                    end up saving that much money, if anything, by offering apps
                    through third-party repositories instead of the Play Store.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Antitrust case aside, I think Apple would be better
                    served by getting ahead of all this. Universal iPhone
                    sideloading support will happen eventually. Resisting it
                    only hurts the company at this point.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the end of the day, it will be up to the users to decide
                    whether to install apps from third parties. In the long run,
                    I don’t think Apple’s App Store bottom line will see a big
                    impact. Not as long as I, and others like me, continue to
                    avoid iPhone sideloading and all the risks that it entails.

                    The biggest problem with email addresses as 'permanent'
                    identifiers is that people's email addresses change even
                    within a single organization (for example, a university).
                    They change for the same collection of reasons that people's
                    commonly used names and logins change. An organization that
                    refuses to change or redo the email addresses it assigns to
                    people is being unusually cruel in ways that are probably
                    not legally sustainable in any number of places.

                    In a nutshell: Mozilla is seemingly on a journey to change
                    the internet again, but it will not get there with Firefox.
                    The open-source browser is barely mentioned throughout the
                    company's latest corporate manifesto, where AI algorithms
                    have become the real focus of the show.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the recently published
                    <a href="https://stateof.mozilla.org/"
                      >State of Mozilla for 2023</a
                    >, the open-source foundation made some bold statements
                    about its plans for the future. The organization aims to
                    build a better internet "by the people, for the people,"
                    countering the overwhelming influence of Big Tech
                    corporations with open data and AI services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The updated State of Mozilla is essentially designed to be a
                    company manifesto written in corporate lingo but it also
                    comes with the latest financial statements related to 2022
                    results, providing some interesting food for thought about
                    how and where the organization is spending its money.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mozilla's CEO, Mitchell Baker, received a substantial
                    compensation increase, as stated in the document, going from
                    $5,591,406 (2021) to $6,903,089 in 2022. Baker mentioned
                    that the organization is clearly moving in the right
                    direction but needs to do more and have a larger impact on
                    the market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mozilla's CEO is being paid a lot more while Firefox
                    keeps losing users, and someone has
                    <a
                      href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5053290/mozilla-2023-annual-report-ceo-pay-skyrockets-while-firefox-marketshare-nosedives"
                      >suggested</a
                    >
                    that the organization's plan is now to fully transition away
                    from the open-source browser. Mozilla is increasing its pile
                    of financial assets, and Baker has clearly stated that the
                    organization is ready to make "difficult choices" when it
                    comes to shutting down unprofitable projects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, what future is Mozilla trying to build for itself and
                    internet users? The foundation is pushing the idea of a
                    trustworthy AI, improved ML algorithms with rich data, and
                    privacy prioritization. Mozilla still wants to put people
                    ahead of profit, the company's CEO said, but also take more
                    risks and move quickly in the growing AI market.

                    "Fog involves a lot of physics processes so it requires a
                    computer model that can better represent all these
                    processes," Pu said. "Because fog is clouds near the ground,
                    it requires a high-resolution model to resolve it, so we
                    need models at a very fine scale, which are computationally
                    very expensive. The current models (relatively coarser in
                    resolution) are not capable of resolving the fog processes,
                    and we need to improve the models for better fog
                    prediction."

                    A security report can take away a developer from fixing a
                    really annoying bug. because a security issue is always more
                    important than other bugs. If the report turned out to be
                    crap, we did not improve security and we missed out time on
                    fixing bugs or developing a new feature. Not to mention how
                    it drains you on energy having to deal with rubbish.

                Often wannabe security consultants will take the output of an
                LLM and modify it with their own language, thus intentionally or
                unintentionally obscuring some of the telltale warning signs of
                LLM-generated bunk.

                    mass production in the second half of 2024, is now expected
                    to have only limited production by that time. Samsung is
                    apparently scaling back its Texas operation due to uncertain
                    financial factors, including CHIPS Act subsidies and the

                    been delayed, much like

                    intentional, with the corporation deciding to postpone mass
                    production in favor of a smaller output levels until 2025.

                    of Samsung, especially when considering CHIPS Act subsidies
                    and the state of the global economy.

                    [...] The health of the global economy is also on Samsung's
                    mind. Although the U.S. has seemingly achieved a so-called
                    soft landing and has avoided a true recession, other parts
                    of the world aren't so lucky. Samsung is still reeling from

                    in 2025, but the high peaks of 2021 are apparently well in
                    the past. All of this just makes Samsung tepid about its
                    $200 billion investment in the U.S., which could spell
                    success or disaster for the company.

                    Vitamin D deficiency, depression and diabetes are among a

                    young-onset dementia, a

                    The condition - which around 70,000 people in the UK are
                    thought to be living with - is when symptoms of dementia
                    develop before the age of 65.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study challenges the notion that genetics are the sole
                    cause of the condition, researchers have said.

                  <p>
                    Targeting the factors they identified could help reduce the
                    risk, they added.

                  <p>
                    A list of 15 factors - which is similar to that for
                    late-onset dementia - includes alcohol abuse, stroke, social
                    isolation and hearing impairment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those with a higher formal education were seen to be at less
                    of a risk.

                  <p>
                    The study "breaks new ground" and could "herald a new era"
                    for interventions to reduce new cases, said Dr Janice
                    Ranson, one of the study's authors.

                  <p>
                    The most common feature of dementia is memory loss, but
                    other symptoms include changes in behaviour, and becoming
                    lost in familiar places.
                  </p>

                    [...] The study, conducted by scientists from the UK and the
                    Netherlands, is the "largest and most robust study of its
                    kind ever conducted", one of it's authors, Professor David
                    Llewellyn, has said.

                  <p>
                    [...] Prof Llewellyn said there was still much to learn but
                    the study "reveals that we may be able to take action to
                    reduce risk of this debilitating condition".

                    [...] "The cause is often assumed to be genetic, but for
                    many people we don't actually know exactly what the cause
                    is. This is why we also wanted to investigate other risk

                factors were significantly associated with a higher YOD risk,

                    <strong>Rebecca Simon</strong>:  A lot of people ask me
                    about the pirate accent: "Aaarr matey!" That accent we think
                    of comes from the actor Robert Newton who played Long John
                    Silver in the 1950 film

                    the end of the day, pirates were sailors. People ask about
                    what they wore, what they ate, thinking it's somehow
                    different. But the reality is it was the same as other
                    sailors. They might have had better clothes and better food
                    because of how often they robbed other ships.

                    <strong>Rebecca Simon</strong>: There were several reasons
                    why piracy really began to die down in the 1720s. One was an
                    increase in the Royal Navy presence so the seas were a lot
                    more heavily patrolled and it was becoming more difficult to
                    make a living as a pirate. Colonial governors and colonists
                    were no longer supporting pirates the way they once had, so
                    a lot of pirates were now losing their alliances and
                    protections. A lot of major pirate leaders who had been
                    veterans of the

                    It was just becoming too risky. And by 1730 a lot more wars
                    were breaking out, which required people who could sail and
                    fight. Pirates were offered pardons if they agreed to become
                    a privateer, basically a government-sanctioned mercenary at
                    sea where they were contracted to attack specific enemies.
                    As payment they got to keep about 80 percent of what they
                    stole. A lot of pirates decided that was more lucrative and
                    more stable.
