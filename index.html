                    If viewers sometimes feel guilty about binge-watching
                    television programing, they really shouldn't. Though its
                    name implies impulsive behavior, binge-watching TV is a
                    common activity planned out by viewers, suggests new
                    research from the University of California San Diego's
                    <a href="https://rady.ucsd.edu/"
                      >Rady School of Management</a

                    <a href="https://gps.ucsd.edu/"
                      >School of Global Policy and Strategy</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study, in collaboration with the Tepper School of
                    Business at Carnegie Mellon University and Fox School of
                    Business at Temple University, reveals that viewers prefer
                    to binge-watch certain types of programming over others.
                    They're also more likely to pay to watch shows consecutively
                    and/or wait to be able to consume more than one episode at a
                    time.

                  <p>
                    "We find that the notion of a show being so interesting that
                    it just sucks people in and they can't pull away is not the
                    whole story," said study coauthor Uma Karmarkar, assistant
                    professor of marketing and innovation at UC San Diego's Rady
                    School of Management and School of Global Policy and
                    Strategy. "Binge-watching can have a negative connotation,
                    like binge eating or binge drinking. It is generally seen as
                    impulsive, maybe problematic, but certainly very indulgent.
                    However, media consumption is more complex. Binge-watching
                    is not always about a failure of self-control; it can also
                    be a thoughtful preference and planned behavior."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The paper that is forthcoming in "The Journal of
                    Experimental Psychology: Applied" finds that people tend to
                    plan to binge shows they perceive to be more sequential and
                    connected—those that have an overarching narrative. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the authors do find that no matter how bingeable a
                    show is, viewers are much less likely to plan to watch
                    multiple episodes if the streaming service or channel
                    features commercials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But the differences in plans to binge independent and
                    sequential media were also replicated in how people approach
                    streaming media in the form of online education courses. A
                    separate experiment revealed that people are more likely to
                    plan to binge a Coursera class if it is perceived to be more
                    sequential. Taking this one step further, the authors
                    analyzed real-world data from the Coursera platform and
                    found that these plans to binge-learn accurately predicted
                    viewing behavior in enrolled students.

                While “hacking” is often used to mean criminal intrusion into
                computer systems, some, including Bruce Schneier, use a more
                general definition that includes any kind of creative (mis-)use
                of something. While this kind of mindset is often talked about
                in tech circles, it is not restricted to it. The governor of the
                US state of Wisconsin found a
                <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66137111"

                of an apparently-flexible line-item veto power to change the
                following text:

                    school year, add $325 to the result under par.

                This essentially changes the time frame of the adjustment from 2
                years (2023–2025) to 402 years (2023&amp;ndash2425). Bruce
                Schneier points out that this is not the first time Wisconsin's
                line-item veto has been used to change a timeframe, and
                <a

                to it as: “Definitely a hack. This is not what anyone thinks
                about when they imagine using a line-item veto.”

                    When Let's Encrypt first launched, we needed to ensure that
                    our certificates were widely trusted. To that end, we
                    arranged to have our intermediate certificates

                    intermediates would be trusted, even while our own ISRG Root
                    X1 wasn't yet. During subsequent years, our Root X1 became

                    Come late 2021, our cross-signed intermediates and DST Root

                    rather than our intermediates – which would outlive DST Root
                    CA X3 itself. This stopgap allowed those old Android devices
                    to continue trusting our certificates for three more years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On September 30th, 2024, that cross-sign too will expire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the last three years, the percentage of Android devices
                    which trust our ISRG Root X1 has risen from 66% to 93.9%.
                    That percentage will increase further over the next year,
                    especially as Android releases version 14, which has the
                    ability to

                      >update its trust store without a full OS update</a
                    >. In addition, dropping the cross-sign will reduce the
                    number of certificate bytes sent in a TLS handshake by over
                    40%. Finally, it will significantly reduce our operating
                    costs, allowing us to focus our funding on continuing to
                    improve your privacy and security.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For these reasons, we will not be getting a new cross-sign
                    to extend compatibility any further.

                    Zwierlein's group has been studying the behavior of
                    potassium-40 atoms, which are known fermions, that can be
                    prepared in one of two spin states. When a potassium atom of
                    one spin interacts with an atom of another spin, they can
                    form a pair, similar to superconducting electrons. But under
                    normal, room-temperature conditions, the atoms interact in a
                    blur that is difficult to capture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "It was bloody difficult to get to a point where we
                    could actually take these images," Zwierlein says. "You can
                    imagine at first getting big fat holes in your imaging, your
                    atoms running away, nothing is working. We've had terribly
                    complicated problems to solve in the lab through the years,
                    and the students had great stamina, and finally, to be able
                    to see these images was absolutely elating."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What the team saw was pairing behavior among the atoms that
                    was predicted by the Hubbard model — a widely held theory
                    believed to hold they key to the behavior of electrons in
                    high-temperature superconductors, materials that exhibit
                    superconductivity at relatively high (though still very
                    cold) temperatures. Predictions of how electrons pair up in
                    these materials have been tested through this model, but
                    never directly observed until now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The pairing behavior between these atoms must also
                    occur in superconducting electrons, and Zwierlein says the
                    team's new snapshots will help to inform scientists'
                    understanding of high-temperature superconductors, and
                    perhaps provide insight into how these materials might be
                    tuned to higher, more practical temperatures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If you normalize our gas of atoms to the density of
                    electrons in a metal, we think this pairing behavior should
                    occur far above room temperature," Zwierlein offers. "That
                    gives a lot of hope and confidence that such pairing
                    phenomena can in principle occur at elevated temperatures,
                    and there's no a priori limit to why there shouldn't be a
                    room-temperature superconductor one day."

                    world's last declared chemical weapons stockpile as soon as
                    tomorrow, July 7th. The US and most other nations agreed to
                    completely eliminate their arsenals within 10 years after
                    the Chemical Weapons Convention took effect in 1997, but the
                    sheer size of the American collection (many of the warheads
                    are several decades old) and the complexity of safe disposal
                    left the country running late.

                    The current method relies on robots that puncture, drain and
                    wash the chemical-laden artillery shells and rockets, which
                    are then baked to render them harmless. The drained gas is
                    diluted in hot water and

                    either with bacteria (for mustard gas) or caustic soda (for
                    nerve agents). The remaining liquid is then incinerated.
                    Teams use X-rays to check for leaks before destruction
                    starts, and they remotely monitor robots to minimize contact
                    with hazardous material.

                  <p>
                    [...] The US last used chemical weapons in World War I, but
                    kept producing them for decades as a deterrent. Attention to
                    the program first spiked in 1968, when strange sheep deaths
                    led to revelations that the Army was storing chemical
                    weapons across the US and even testing them in the open.

                  <p>
                    This measure will only wipe out confirmed stockpiles. Russia

                    of secretly making nerve gas despite insisting that it
                    destroyed its last chemical weapons in 2017. Pro-government
                    Syrian military forces and ISIS extremists used the weapons
                    throughout much of the 2010s. This won't stop hostile
                    countries and terrorists from using the toxins.

                    Even so, this is a major milestone. In addition to wiping
                    out an entire category of weapons of mass destruction, it
                    represents another step toward reduced lethality in war.

                    The Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) is also known
                    as the "Moon Sniper" thanks to its use of technologies that
                    JAXA claims "make a qualitative shift towards being able to
                    land where we want and not just where it is easy to land."
                    If JAXA can pull that off, it believes "it will become
                    possible to land on planets even more resource scarce than
                    the Moon."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The sobriquet "sniper" has been applied because the craft is
                    equipped with high-resolution cameras and an image
                    processing algorithm. As it swings into lunar orbit, it will
                    be able to recognize craters and measure its position, then
                    decide on an optimal spot to land. JAXA expects it to touch
                    down within 100 meters of its preferred target.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That accuracy is important, because it means future missions
                    can send instruments to specific locations, instead of
                    having to design missions around the places where landing
                    will be easiest. As the guy said – we do this not because
                    it's easy, but because it's hard.

                    If you're printing something on actual paper, there's a good
                    chance it's important, like a tax form or a job contract.

                    But popular printing products and services won't promise not
                    to read it. In fact, they won't even promise not to share it
                    with outside marketing firms.

                    The spread of digital file-sharing — along with obnoxious
                    business practices by printing manufacturers — has pushed
                    many U.S. households to give up at-home printers and rely on
                    nearby printing services instead. At the same time, major
                    printer manufacturers have adopted mobile apps and
                    cloud-based storage, creating new opportunities to collect
                    personal data from customers. Whether you're walking to the
                    corner store or sending your files to the cloud, it's tough
                    to figure out whether you're printing in private.

                    [...] So in a recent paper published in
                    <a
                      href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.201002"
                      ><em>Physical Review Letters</em></a
                    >, Slepian, Hou and Cahn proposed an inventive way to search
                    for evidence that parity was indeed violated during the Big
                    Bang. Their idea was to imagine every possible combination
                    of four galaxies in the night sky. Connect those four
                    galaxies together by imaginary lines, and you have a
                    lopsided pyramid, a tetrahedron. This is the simplest 3D
                    shape possible –and thus the simplest shape that has a
                    mirror image, the key test for parity symmetry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their method required analyzing a trillion possible
                    tetrahedrons for each of a million galaxies, an incredible
                    number of combinations. "Eventually we realized we needed
                    new math," Slepian said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Slepian's group discovered that, indeed, the universe
                    imprinted an early preference for left- or right-handed
                    stuff onto the material that eventually became today's
                    galaxies. (The complex math makes it difficult to say
                    whether that preference was for right-handedness or
                    left-handedness, though.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Since parity violation can only be imprinted on the
                    universe during inflation, if what we found is true, it
                    provides smoking-gun evidence for inflation," Slepian said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings by Slepian's lab can't yet explain how the laws
                    of physics changed, which will require new theories going
                    beyond the Standard Model, a theory that explains our
                    current universe. Now the race is on for scientists to
                    produce this theory that can explain the universe's ancient
                    handedness and the abundance of matter we see today.

                    [...] How are we supposed to judge the value of large
                    scientific projects? With traditional projects the
                    cost-benefit analysis is rather straightforward. We sink in
                    a bunch of time and money into a project, and we judge the
                    success of those projects based on how much money they make
                    or how many benefits they provide to society.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But by their very nature large scientific projects don't
                    return any money on the investment. And they don't have any
                    immediate impact on society. So are they really worth it?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The first benefit that large scientific projects have
                    is that they provide a training ground for highly skilled
                    workers. The vast majority of the people working in large
                    collaborations are temporary researchers, hired right out of
                    grad school for a limited period of time to accomplish the
                    goals of the collaboration. Once the project is over those
                    people move on to other things, and since there are
                    essentially no jobs in academia most of those people go into
                    industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Secondly, many corporations are involved in the
                    process of assisting scientific goals. They may make
                    instruments or optics or specialized sensors, for example.
                    Those industries get paid to do their work and they develop
                    new technological solutions that can then be applied to
                    other problems or spun off into their own revenue generating
                    products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When it comes to satisfaction, we are all ultimately human.
                    Part of what makes us human is our innate curiosity about
                    the world around us. Science satisfies that curiosity in an
                    enormous way. Science makes the results of its research
                    available for public consumption. What we learn in science
                    is available and open to all. We enjoy the fruits of
                    scientific labor the same way we enjoy the work of artists
                    and musicians. It is something that touches all of us and
                    impacts all of us.

                    performance shortfalls, according to new University at
                    Buffalo School of Management research.

                  <p>
                    Forthcoming in the Review of Accounting Studies, the study
                    found that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
                    mask the true value of companies by marking investments in
                    intangibles like technology, brands and human capital as
                    losses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Even as the economy boomed in 2019 following a decade of
                    growth, about half of all public companies reported losses
                    because accounting rules force them to report losses despite
                    initial success," says Feng Gu, Ph.D., chair and professor
                    of accounting and law in the UB School of Management. "This
                    is just another indication of how broken accounting is. We
                    need to treat intangible investments as real economic
                    assets."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "GAAP losers are less likely to decline, more likely
                    to reverse their losses, and even have better future stock
                    performance than real losers or profitable firms," says Gu.
                    "This is an alarming consequence for a group of highly
                    dynamic and innovative firms that are the driving force
                    behind the growing intangible revolution in our economy."

                  <p>
                    Researchers at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science
                    (CEMS) in Japan have discovered a compound that uses a
                    chemical reaction to store ammonia, potentially offering a
                    safer and easier way to store this important chemical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This discovery, published in the
                    <i>Journal of the American Chemical Society</i> on July 10,
                    makes it possible not only to safely and conveniently store
                    ammonia, but also the important hydrogen is [sic] carries.
                    This finding should help lead the way to a decarbonized
                    society with a practical hydrogen economy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For society to make the switch from carbon-based to
                    hydrogen-based energy, we need a safe way to store and
                    transport hydrogen, which by itself is highly combustible.
                    One way to do this is to store it as part of another
                    molecule and extract it as needed. Ammonia, chemically
                    written as NH<sub>3</sub>, makes a good hydrogen carrier
                    because three hydrogen atoms are packed into each molecule,
                    with almost 20% of ammonia being hydrogen by weight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem, however, is that ammonia is a highly corrosive
                    gas, making it difficult to store and use. Currently,
                    ammonia is generally stored by liquefying it at temperatures
                    well below freezing in pressure-resistant containers. Porous
                    compounds can also store ammonia at room temperature and
                    pressure, but storage capacity is low, and the ammonia
                    cannot always be retrieved easily.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new study reports the discovery of a perovskite, a
                    material with a distinctive repetitive crystal structure,
                    which can easily store ammonia and also allows easy and
                    complete retrieval at relatively low temperatures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research team led by Masuki Kawamoto at RIKEN CEMS
                    focused on the perovskite ethylammonium lead iodide
                    (EAPbI<sub>3</sub>), chemically written as
                    CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>.
                    They found that its one-dimensional columnar structure
                    undergoes a chemical reaction with ammonia at room
                    temperature and pressure, and dynamically transforms into a
                    two-dimensional layered structure called lead iodide
                    hydroxide, or Pb(OH)I.

                    Tremblay and Mona Awad. Each lawsuit alleges violations of
                    the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, unfair competition
                    laws, and negligence.

                    [...] Authors claim that by utilizing "flagrantly illegal"
                    data sets, OpenAI allegedly infringed copyrights of
                    Silverman's book The Bedwetter, Golden's Ararat, and
                    Kadrey's Sandman Slime. And Meta allegedly infringed
                    copyrights of the same three books, as well as "several"
                    other titles from Golden and Kadrey.

                    [...] Authors are already upset that companies seem to be
                    unfairly profiting off their copyrighted materials, and the
                    Meta lawsuit noted that any unfair profits currently gained
                    could further balloon, as "Meta plans to make the next
                    version of LLaMA commercially available." In addition to
                    other damages, the authors are asking for restitution of
                    alleged profits lost.

                    direct sales from American and European companies. They
                    extend to foreign-made products that use US software and

                    But beware. Democracies – Japan, Europe, and the US – need
                    to ensure that additional moves designed to hurt Beijing do
                    not "boomerang" and end up hurting their own industries.

                    UK.

                    It's a signal that at least one tech giant expects the UK's
                    "replacement for GDPR" – the second take on the Data
                    Protection and Digital Information Bill (DPDIB II) – to be
                    more sympathetic than current British privacy legislation.

                    Meanwhile, over in Germany, Meta can't combine the data it
                    collects about you on Facebook with the stuff you spill on
                    Instagram and WhatsApp, or with other websites and apps you

                    This new Arctic paper "helps to show that any increase in

                    a microplastics researcher at the Ocean Frontiers Institute
                    who did the peatland study. "And as more research into human
                    exposure comes to light, I believe the increase will also be

                    Genolve, a platform for creating professional designs, has
                    just released a major version upgrade which integrates three
                    popular AI text-to-image generators: DALL-E 2, Stability.ai
                    and Midjourney! Just type in a description of the desired
                    image and generate it in seconds for pennies per image.
                    Still, it can be tricky to get exactly what you need and in
                    this blog post you'll learn the tricks and techniques to
                    coax the AI to generate mind-blowing results through prompt
                    engineering. You'll also learn step-by-step how to AI edit

                    extra using a technique called inpainting.

                    A Canadian judge has ordered a farmer to pay more than
                    $CAD82,000 ($92,000) in damages following a legal battle
                    over what the thumbs-up emoji means.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chris Achter, the owner of a farming company in Swift
                    Current, Saskatchewan, had sent a thumbs-up emoji in
                    response to a photograph of a flax-buying contract from a
                    grains buyer in 2021.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Months later, the buyer — which had been doing business with
                    Mr Achter for several years — did not receive the flax as
                    expected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That started a dispute that led to "a far-flung search" to
                    unearth what the thumbs-up emoji means, according to the
                    June court ruling that surfaced in local media this week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The buyer, South West Terminal, argued that the emoji
                    implied acceptance of contractual terms, while Mr Achter
                    said he used it only to indicate that he had received the
                    contract, but not to indicate his agreement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] He [the judge] said: "I am satisfied on the balance of
                    probabilities that Chris okayed or approved the contract
                    just like he had done before except this time he used a
                    thumbs-up emoji."

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Passionate compiler developers and other GCC stakeholders
                    are encouraged to remind themselves to be civil in their
                    discussions and follow other recommendations to foster their
                    community. Jason Merrill of the GCC Steering Committee wrote
                    in their announcement of this CoC:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        "The vast majority of the time, the GCC community is a
                        very civil, cooperative space. On the rare occasions
                        that it isn't, it's helpful to have something to point
                        to to remind people of our expectations. It's also good
                        for newcomers to have something to refer to, for both
                        how they are expected to conduct themselves and how they
                        can expect to be treated.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          More importantly, if there is offensive behavior that
                        isn't corrected immediately, it's important for there to
                        be a way to report that to the project leadership so
                        that we can intervene.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          At this time the CoC is preliminary: the code itself
                        should be considered active, but the CoC committee (and
                        so the reporting and response procedures) are not yet in
                        place."

                    Wildfires raging across Canada have already broken records
                    for total area burned, the number of people forced to
                    evacuate their homes and the cost of fighting the blazes,
                    and the fire season is only halfway finished, officials said
                    Thursday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's no understatement to say that the 2023 fire season is
                    and will continue to be record breaking in a number of
                    ways," Michael Norton, director general, Northern Forestry
                    Centre, Canadian Forest Service, said Thursday during a
                    briefing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The fires have burned 8.8 million hectares (27.7
                    million acres) an area about the size of the state of
                    Virginia. This already exceeds the record of 7.6 million
                    hectares (18.7 million acres) set in 1989 and is 11 times
                    the 10-year average experienced by this date.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The final area burned for this season may yet be
                    significantly higher," said Norton. "What we can say with
                    certainty right now is that 2023 is a record-breaking year
                    since at least since 1986 when accurate records started to
                    be kept."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Allen said the fine particles found in fire smoke not only
                    have the ability to penetrate deep into airways, they also
                    can travel long distances meaning they could drift far into
                    the U.S.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There have been reports that fires in Eastern Canada and
                    Quebec are affecting air quality in Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There are about 3,790 provincial firefighters battling
                    the blazes across the country being assisted by Canadian
                    Armed Forces personnel. Another 3,258 firefighters from
                    Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, the U.S., Chile, Costa
                    Rica, Mexico, Spain, Portugal, South Korea and the European
                    Union have travelled to Canada to fight fires.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Norton said the cost of fighting wildfires has steadily
                    grown and is approaching about CDN$1 billion (US$750
                    million) a year.

                    At the time, the NHTSA said it found reasons to investigate

                    The ridiculously economical $74.5 million mission aims to
                    land near Luna's south pole in August. From a ramped
                    compartment, the lander will deploy a 26 kilogram rover
                    outfitted with instruments including an Alpha Particle X-ray
                    Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope

                    measure surface thermal properties, Lunar Seismic Activity
                    (ILSA) to measure tremors around the landing site, Radio
                    Anatomy of Moon Bound Hypersensitive ionosphere and
                    Atmosphere (RAMBHA) to study the gas and plasma environment,
                    and a NASA-provided passive Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA)
                    for lunar ranging studies.

                    A propulsion module that carries the rover and lander will
                    stay in a 100km lunar orbit, where it will act as a
                    communication relay satellite, complete with a payload –
                    known as the Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth
                    (SHAPE) – that studies spectral and polarimetric
                    measurements of Earth from roughly 362,000 to 405,000
                    kilometers away.

                    [...] Only three countries - the USA, Russia, and China,
                    have successfully landed missions on the Moon. Good luck,

                    novels by J.R.R. Tolkien. The set includes many copies of
                    The One Ring, including perforated versions meant to be torn
                    apart at the table. But publisher Wizards of the Coast also
                    created a singular copy, covered in gold foil and etched
                    with the original Elvish Black Speech inscription.

                    The U.S. ecosystem is riddled with PFAS. And a new study
                    released this week by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
                    revealed that these toxic chemicals are in almost half of
                    the country's tap water.

                  <p>
                    This is the first time a government agency has tested for
                    and compared PFAS found in private and public water supplies
                    throughout the country. 45% of the locations tested positive
                    for PFAS chemicals. This stands for

                    different chemicals that can be found in everyday items like

                    larger problem, which is the fact that companies are allowed
                    to use PFAS in the first place, years after the public has

                    products posed to the public for decades. The chemicals are
                    already in our environment, the exposure risk will continue
                    to persist until stricter regulations are put in place

                <div>
                  <p>
                    The Intel 8086 microprocessor (1978) started the x86
                    architecture that continues to this day. In this blog post,
                    I'm focusing on a small part of the chip: the address and
                    data pins that connect the chip to external memory and I/O
                    devices. In many processors, this circuitry is
                    straightforward, but it is complicated in the 8086 for two
                    reasons. First, Intel decided to package the 8086 as a
                    40-pin DIP, which didn't provide enough pins for all the
                    functionality. Instead, the 8086 multiplexes address, data,
                    and status. In other words, a pin can have multiple roles,
                    providing an address bit at one time and a data bit at
                    another time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second complication is that the 8086 has a 20-bit
                    address space (due to its infamous segment registers), while
                    the data bus is 16 bits wide. As will be seen, the "extra"
                    four address bits have more impact than you might expect. To
                    summarize, 16 pins, called AD0-AD15, provide 16 bits of
                    address and data. The four remaining address pins (A16-A19)
                    are multiplexed for use as status pins, providing
                    information about what the processor is doing for use by
                    other parts of the system. You might expect that the 8086
                    would thus have two types of pin circuits, but it turns out
                    that there are four distinct circuits, which I will discuss
                    below.

                    has reported. The app delivery platforms are asking for a
                    temporary restraining order against the new rules, set to be
                    implemented on July 12th. "We will not stand by and let the
                    harmful impacts of this earnings standard on New York City
                    customers, merchants, and the delivery workers it was

                    The Worker's Justice Project that backed the survey decried
                    the new lawsuit. "This latest legal maneuver to prop up
                    their business model comes at the expense of workers who can
                    barely survive in a city facing a massive affordability
                    crisis," director Ligia Guallpa told the <em>Post</em>.

                  <p>
                    New York became the first US city to mandate a minimum wage
                    for food delivery workers, ordering platforms to pay workers
                    $17.96 per hour, plus tips, by July 12th. The minimum wage
                    in the city is $15 per hour, but the extra amount accounts
                    for the fact that delivery workers are usually paid as
                    contractors, so have higher taxes and must pay work-related
                    expenses out of pocket. According to an estimate from the
                    DCWP (NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection), NYC
                    has more than 60,000 food delivery workers who earn an
                    average of $7.09 per hour.

                    learn that strapping thousands of dollars of components to
                    your body often leads to arrest? Once again, the country's
                    customs have caught someone trying the same old trick. On
                    this occasion, a trafficker had 420 M.2 SSDs attached to his
                    torso using tape.

                  <p>
                    [...] The 420 M.2 SSDs are said to be worth around
                    HK$258,000 or $32,984.94. That works out to an average of
                    $78.53 each, so they're likely on the higher end of the

                      Increased difficulty in mining Bitcoin positively predicts
                      returns. This supports the theory that as blockchain
                      technology requirements increase, bitcoin's supply is
                      reduced, thus increasing its return.

                    <li>
                      Bitcoin returns are positively driven by investor
                      sentiment, indicating the speculative nature of the
                      cryptocurrency as an asset.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Higher stress levels or financial turmoil in the economy
                      cause a decrease in future bitcoin returns, underscoring
                      the risks associated with holding bitcoin as an asset.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    According to the researchers, bitcoin has functioned in
                    three different economic roles over time: as a form of
                    currency, as a speculative security, and as a safe-haven
                    commodity due to its scarcity and mining costs.

                    When compared to the thousands of other programming
                    languages that have been created in the past 60+ years, PL/I
                    was a success. PL/I reportedly was used in the development
                    of the Multics operating system and the S/360 version of
                    Sabre airline reservation system, among others. PL/I was
                    taught at the college-level. PL/I has been around for
                    decades. Most programming languages would be envious to do
                    half as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But PL/I didn't achieve its strategic goal of consolidating
                    scientific and business computing with the best new
                    programming paradigms that research could provide, and it
                    wasn't for a lack of trying. That goal, although
                    well-intentioned, became impossible as both FORTRAN and
                    COBOL kept accelerating. In terms of adoption, COBOL became
                    the most widely used programming language in the world by
                    1970, and ripping out an existing COBOL system and replacing
                    it with PL/I was going to be a hard sell to customers. The
                    same could surely be said of existing FORTRAN systems. COBOL
                    and FORTRAN also kept accelerating in terms of language
                    definition during the 1960s, making PL/I's feature parity
                    with them not just a challenge, but also ambiguous as it
                    took both COBOL and FORTRAN years to stabilize their own
                    respective standards.

                    Caraiani and Newton achieved modularity — for all elliptic
                    curves over about half of all imaginary quadratic fields —
                    by figuring out how to adapt a process for proving
                    modularity pioneered by Wiles and others to elliptic curves
                    over imaginary quadratic fields.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The work is a technical achievement in its own right,
                    and it opens the door to making progress on some of the most
                    important questions in math in the imaginary setting.

                    [...] In the late 1950s, Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimura
                    proposed that there is a perfect 1-to-1 matching between
                    certain modular forms and elliptic curves. The next decade
                    Robert Langlands built on this idea in the construction of
                    his
                    <a
                      href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/videos/the-langlands-program-explained/"

                    >, which has become one of the most far-reaching and
                    consequential research programs in math.

                  <p>
                    If the 1-to-1 correspondence is true, it would give
                    mathematicians a powerful set of tools for understanding the
                    solutions to elliptic curves. For example, there's a kind of
                    numerical value associated with each modular form. One of
                    math's most important open problems (proving it comes with a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium/birch-and-swinnerton-dyer-conjecture/"
                      >million-dollar prize</a
                    >) — the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture — proposes
                    that if that value is zero, then the elliptic curve
                    associated to that modular form has infinitely many rational
                    solutions, and if it's not zero, the elliptic curve has
                    finitely many rational solutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But before anything like that can be tackled, mathematicians
                    need to know that the correspondence holds: Hand me an
                    elliptic curve, and I can hand you its matching modular
                    form. Proving this is what many mathematicians, from Wiles
                    to Caraiani and Newton, have been up to over the last few
                    decades.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Their result provides a foundation for investigating
                    some of the same basic questions about elliptic curves over
                    imaginary quadratic fields that mathematicians pursue over
                    the rationals and the reals. This includes the imaginary
                    version of Fermat's Last Theorem — though additional
                    groundwork needs to be laid before that is approachable —
                    and the imaginary version of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
                    conjecture.

                    Android manufacturers tend to love big spec sheets, even if
                    those giant numbers won't do much for day-to-day phone
                    usage. In that vein, we've got the new high-water mark for

                    the most amount of memory ever in an Android phone. Because
                    we're all about big numbers, it also comes with 1TB of
                    storage. [...] This suped-up 24GB version of the phone

                    You definitely want an adequate amount of RAM in an Android
                    phone. All these apps are designed around cheap phones,
                    though, and with Android's aggressive background app
                    management, there's usually not much of a chance to use a
                    ton of RAM. Theoretically, a phone like this would let you
                    multitask better, since apps could stay in memory longer,
                    and you wouldn't have to start them back up when switching
                    tasks. Most people aren't quickly switching through
                    <em>that</em> many apps, though, and some heavy apps, games
                    especially, will just automatically turn off a few seconds
                    once they're in the background.

                There were a few smartphones on the market with 18 GB, but it
                looks like 20 GB has been skipped entirely by Nubia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now we need to be on the lookout for 32 GB of RAM and alien
                technology in upcoming smartphones.

                    NANOGrav's results were published in five papers in The
                    Astrophysical Journal Letters, while papers appeared in
                    other journals from the European, Australian, Indian and
                    Chinese pulsar timing arrays.

                    The NANOGrav papers report a "strong evidence" of these
                    long, low-frequency signals, reporting the detection at a
                    3.5- to 4-sigma level, which is less than the 5-sigma
                    threshold that physicists usually want to claim a discovery.
                    But a 4-sigma amplitude is better than the 3.5 sigma from

                    Mandating a simpler cancellation process would confuse

                    Trade groups representing publishers, advertisers and
                    videogame companies have come out against the Federal Trade
                    Commission's proposed requirement that companies offer
                    consumers an easy click-to-cancel way to get out of
                    subscriptions and memberships.

                    The FTC earlier this year proposed a rule that would require
                    companies to make it as easy for customers to stop recurring
                    charges as it is to sign up to them. That would mean an end
                    to onerous "click to subscribe, call to cancel" routines and
                    other systems designed to introduce friction into the
                    cancellation process.

                    researchers. But now, a team of researchers at Johns Hopkins
                    may have shed new light on the strange discharge.

                    them besides iron — silicon, calcium, aluminum, sodium — and
                    they all varied," said Ken Livi, a research scientist and

                    The existence of these mysterious nanospheres, which haven't
                    been detected until now, runs counter to the prevailing
                    theory that the blood-red liquid was caused by an abundance
                    of minerals.

                  <p>
                    Minerals are crystalline in nature, while these nanospheres,
                    which are 100 times smaller than red blood cells, aren't.

                  <p>
                    Their existence also sheds new light on the microorganisms
                    and bacteria that have lived for "potentially millions of
                    years underneath the saline waters of the Antarctic
                    glacier," according to Livi.

                    The currents of air that wrap around our planet are becoming
                    unrecognizable to climate scientists.

                    The southern part of the jet stream over North America has
                    completely broken apart and is currently trapped in a
                    vicious revolution that has triggered an off-the-chart
                    heatwave.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While it's normal for the air currents to stop, split apart,
                    recombine and flow in opposite directions, on average these
                    tropospheric air streams are typically quite continuous over
                    long distances with an overall west to east flow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The current fragmentation is unlike anything specialists
                    have seen before.

                    [...] Jet streams are known to get 'blocked' on occasion,
                    trapping weather systems in certain regions for days on end.
                    But recent evidence suggests climate change could cause more
                    blockages than usual by slowing down jet streams so they
                    break apart, causing chaotic weather on the ground.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That seems to be what's happening right now in North
                    America, and it's not just climate change that's
                    contributing.

                    Mann explains that El Niño has likely exacerbated the
                    situation, too.

                    Even the average layperson can clearly see the differences
                    when comparing a normal pattern of jet streams to what's
                    occurring today.

                    The Respawn Ninja RN988 is a whitelabel by mwave (an
                    Australian online computer parts retailer). I'm not entirely
                    sure of the OEM, I have not been able to find any matching
                    products with the extra 4th status LED for locking
                    (disabling) the Win key.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After plugging it in I immediately noticed two problems:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1. The switches were definitely not brown-style (tactile
                    bump halfway through being pressed), they were instead
                    red-style (smooth when pressed). Not quite what I wanted but
                    hey for this price I'll happily try it out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2. The Pause, Home, End and numpad * keys were permanently
                    lit up and did not work when pressed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The faulty keys were a serious problem. Every few hours they
                    might fix themselves for a while, but then occasionally spam
                    lots of keyboard input before returning to being broken.

                    Exceptions will be made for lessons on digital skills, or if

                While it starts out about Tesla self-driving software, it seems
                that the Dawn Project is also taking on security for safety
                critical software in general -- a topic near and dear to many at
                SN.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Dan O'Dowd is a man on a mission: to get Tesla's Full
                    Self-Driving (FSD) technology outlawed. He's likely spent
                    millions of his own money—including a reported $600K on a
                    recent Super Bowl ad and full-page ad in The New York Times
                    last November—to accomplish this goal via his nonprofit
                    group The Dawn Project. And he's incurred the wrath of Elon
                    Musk and the Tesla co-founder and CEO's most rabid fans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Last August The Dawn Project conducted tests and shot
                    a video showing a Tesla Model 3 using FSD plowing into a
                    mannequin meant to represent a child. Tesla sent The Dawn
                    Project a cease-and-desist letter calling the videos
                    "defamatory." O'Dowd responded in a tweet by calling Musk a
                    "crybaby" for complaining about the test and offered to
                    reproduce tests for the media and regulators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's what brought us to Santa Barbara last week, where
                    Green Hills Software, which O'Dowd founded in 1982 and is
                    president and CEO, is based. Green Hills develops
                    ultra-secure software for aviation, including the operating
                    system (OS) for the Boeing 787 and B1-B bomber and the Orion
                    crew exploration vehicle manufactured by Lockheed Martin and
                    operated by NASA. Green Hills is also the first and only
                    software company to develop an OS that meets the NSA's
                    certification for EAL 6+ High Robustness, making it almost
                    impossible to hack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] O'Dowd isn't critical of Tesla vehicles and owns five
                    of them: two Roadsters, two Model 3s, and a Model S. The
                    Dawn Project is not only attacking Tesla FSD but any
                    computer system it deems a danger. "Connecting the power
                    grid, hospitals, and millions of cars to the Internet with
                    software riddled with bugs and security defects has turned
                    these systems into potential weapons of mass destruction at
                    the mercy of hackers," the organization says on its website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We've been taking all the things that our lives depend
                    on—water treatment plants and hospitals—where when something
                    fails thousands or even millions of people could die,"
                    O'Dowd said.

                    Google updated its privacy policy over the weekend,
                    explicitly saying the company reserves the right to scrape
                    just about everything you post online to build its AI tools.
                    If Google can read your words, assume they belong to the
                    company now, and expect that they're nesting somewhere in
                    the bowels of a chatbot.

                    "Google uses information to improve our services and to
                    develop new products, features and technologies that benefit
                    our users and the public,"
                    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
                      >the new Google policy says</a
                    >. "For example, we use publicly available information to
                    help train Google's AI models and build products and
                    features like Google Translate, Bard, and Cloud AI
                    capabilities."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Previously, Google said the data would be used "for
                    language models," rather than "AI models," and where the
                    older policy just mentioned Google Translate, Bard and Cloud
                    AI now make an appearance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is an unusual clause for a privacy policy. Typically,
                    these policies describe ways that a business uses the
                    information that you post on the company's own services.
                    Here, it seems Google reserves the right to harvest and
                    harness data posted on any part of the public web, as if the
                    whole internet is the company's own AI playground. Google
                    did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

                    "Over the past 10 years, we've removed about 47 tonnes of
                    snares and bear traps," says Michael Keigwin, the founder of
                    <a href="https://ugandacf.org/"
                      >Uganda Conservation Foundation (UCF)</a

                  <p>
                    Speaking from the Ugandan capital, Kampala, Keigwin is
                    referring to a set of photographs showing a 12-tonne pile of
                    tangled snares and metal traps. The images, showing Ugandan
                    government rangers posing with the traps, illustrate an
                    African success story and a world of pain, say those who
                    helped create it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The pile, nicknamed "snare mountain", was collected over 12
                    months as part of continuing conservation efforts at
                    Uganda's

                      >Murchison Falls national park</a
                    >. At the bottom are so-called bear traps, used by poachers
                    to catch elephants, hippos and lions. At the top are wire
                    snares used for smaller animals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To put the reusable traps beyond the reach of poachers
                    for good, the pile, like others before it, is being buried
                    in the foundations of the park's new buildings, which
                    include ranger accommodation, an armoury, a veterinary lab
                    and a police station.

                    for park management, ranger and anti-poaching equipment,
                    community development and "ecoguard" training. Ecoguards
                    live in the surrounding communities and their jobs include
                    snare collection and alerting rangers to wildlife that
                    wander out of the park's protected zone and need to be

                    Not coincidentally, India's joining the Artemis Alliance can
                    be seen as a slap at China, an opponent in Asia with whom
                    the country has had armed conflicts in the past. China has
                    its own lunar ambitions that are opposed to the principles

                    In conjunction with the 2023 Confidential Computing Summit
                    last week, VMware announced a partnership with tech giants

                    Confidential computing relies on a trusted execution
                    environment that ensures the integrity and confidentiality
                    of applications and data, even in the cloud and on

                    With the emergence of multi-cloud deployments and machine
                    learning, confidential computing is expected to help protect
                    intellectual property and sensitive data, but its adoption
                    lags due to difficulties in creating applications for it.

                    Under experimental status, the first flying car has
                    officially been cleared for take off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This week, Alef Aeronautics revealed its flying car "Model
                    A" was granted legal permission from the Federal Aviation
                    Administration to test run the vehicle on the road and in
                    the sky − a move needed before it can be released to the
                    public.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Alef is the first company to receive a Special Airworthiness
                    Certification from the FAA, the company said in a news
                    release. The certification limits the locations and purpose
                    for which the vehicle is allowed to fly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The vehicle will also need to meet National Highway and
                    Traffic Safety Administration safety standards before taking
                    flight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the company's CEO Jim Dukhovny says the company is
                    "hopeful" the certification "will be our next step."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The flying car is now available for preorder, the
                    Santa Clara, California-based company posted on its website.
                    Carrying one or two occupants, the vehicle will sell for
                    about $300,000.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The "Model A" is 100% electric, drivable on public roads and
                    has vertical takeoff and landing capabilities, the company
                    wrote in its release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The car will be a Low Speed Vehicle, meaning it won't go
                    faster than about 25 miles per hour on a paved surface. If a
                    driver needs a faster route, they will be able to use the
                    vehicle's flight capabilities, according to Alef.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As of Friday, presales were open, with interested customers
                    able to pay a $150 deposit to get on the waiting list, or
                    $1,500 for a priority spot on the list's queue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Buyers will be able to complete their configuration as
                    production nears, the company, backed by a Tesla investor,
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company said it plans to start delivering the vehicles
                    to customers by late 2025.

                    If humans could not see blue colors, then one of the biggest
                    problems of OLED technology would have been quickly solved,
                    namely the short shelf life of blue OLE diodes. If the need
                    for the blue diodes did not exist, OLED panels could last
                    over 100 years, or about a million hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's what University of Michigan professors Stephen R.
                    Forrest and Chris Giebink said at the recent Display Week in
                    Los Angeles during a four-hour short course designed to look
                    at the current state of OLED technology. But since OLED
                    technology is only a little over 35 years old, these numbers
                    are based on aging tests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That green OLEDs in particular don't have a problem with
                    durability can definitely be judged in practice by now. When
                    Sony installed green OLED displays in its Walkman almost 20
                    years ago, few would have thought that they would still
                    work. However, the author of these lines owns such an Atrac
                    Walkman himself, whose display still shines in excellent
                    quality.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, only green (or red) displays would only be suitable
                    for special applications. This includes, for example, the
                    digital signage sector For a real display, it is not
                    possible without the color blue and the problems have not
                    been completely solved even 35 years after the emergence of
                    the technology, although they have been greatly reduced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The durability of a panel is increased by various tricks.
                    Important for the blue pixels: They have to stay cool. To
                    achieve this, the surface area is increased and the
                    brightness is reduced in relation to the surface area. In
                    turn, green OLEDs, for example, can be very small and shine
                    extremely brightly. As Forrest said, the green OLEDs in an
                    iPhone shine at around 10,000 candela per square meter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So it's the mix that matters (at the moment). To put that in
                    perspective, even the brightest iPhone Pro only manages
                    1,600 in HDR mode (2,000 outdoors), and that's only in a
                    small space for peak light. Bright light (and thus high
                    temperatures in the panel) reduces the battery life
                    enormously.

                    [...] "I think a lot of consumers — particularly those who
                    diligently track their card expenses — recognize that they
                    use cash so they don't have to think about certain purchases
                    again," Bechler said. "In fact, this strategy of using cash
                    to hide purchases from ourselves if we feel bad about them
                    is something my co-authors and I admitted to doing

                        ECMAScript 2023, the 14th edition, introduced the
                        toSorted, toReversed, with, findLast, and findLastIndex

                        well as the toSpliced method on Array.prototype; added
                        support for #! comments at the beginning of files to
                        better facilitate executable ECMAScript files; and
                        allowed the use of most Symbols as keys in weak

                      on array and typed array. Finding an element in an array
                      is a very common programming pattern, the proposal states.
                      Scenarios under which this feature would be used include
                      when a developer knows that finding an element from last
                      to first may have better performance, or developers care
                      about the order of the elements.

                      use of unique symbols as keys. Currently, WeakMaps are
                      limited to allow only objects as keys.

                      Array.prototype and TypedArray.prototype to enable changes
                      on the array by returning a new copy of it with the
                      change.

                      source texts before passing to JS engines. This plan would
                      move the stripping to engines and unify and standardize
                      how that is done.

                So, I know its been a bit quiet here, but we're working through
                getting through the last few items relating to cutting over to
                newer infrastructure. As such, its been working through the bug
                list, and there's one issue I want to get some feedback on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Back in November when the infrastructure was upgraded to Ubuntu
                22.04, a few users with older devices stopped being able to
                connect to SoylentNews. This confused me, since we've been using
                the same NGINX SSL termination setup that has been in use since
                at least 2016. Well, I finally found the root cause, and as it
                turns out,
                <a href="https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/openssl"
                  >Canonical bumped up the minimum OpenSSL security level</a
                >, which disabled several ciphers, and broke devices not
                supporting TLS 1.2 or later.
              </p>
              <p>
                By testing the site with the SSL Labs site checker, it appears
                anything older than Android 4.0, or iOS 5 is broken. This mostly
                seems to be devices that are over a decade old at this point,
                and won't be able to browse the vast majority of sites on the
                Internet as is. We discussed this internally a bit, and I'm of
                the opinion that its not worth re-enabling the older ciphers to
                allow these devices to reconnect, especially since we're working
                to modernize the stack, and get it as up to date as we can get
                it. I also believe we had very few users who were actually
                affected by this, however, as the editors did get a few emails
                about SN breaking after the site upgrade, I wanted to poll the
                community, and make sure this is not a more widespread issue
                than initially believed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, this is going to be part of a broader discussion on
                what we will and won't support on SoylentNews going forward, and
                this seems as good of place as any to get the ball rolling.
