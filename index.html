                <div>
                  <p>
                    Sports Direct's parent company says live face-recognition
                    (LFR) technology has cut crime in its shops.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cameras check faces against a watch-list, using a system
                    called Facewatch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Monday, 50 MPs and peers supported a letter opposing the
                    use of LFR by Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, which owns the
                    company and other chains such as Flannels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company says it tells shoppers when the technology is
                    installed in a shop.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Frasers Group told BBC News it took its responsibilities
                    around LFR extremely seriously and stressed its
                    effectiveness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Since installing this technology, we have seen a
                    significant reduction in the number of criminal offences
                    taking place in our stores," it said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The letter criticising its use was organised by campaign
                    groups Big Brother Watch, Liberty and Privacy International.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It says research into face-recognition technology suggests;
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      87% of "matches" in Metropolitan Police trials
                      misidentified innocent people
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      women and people belonging to some ethnic minorities are
                      more likely to be misidentified than white men are
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The technology up-ends the democratic principle of suspicion
                    preceding surveillance and "treats everyone who passes the
                    camera like a potential criminal", the letter adds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Shop managers' requests to add someone to the database
                    had to be backed-up with full witness statements and
                    explanations, which a panel of former police officers
                    reviewed before accepting, Mr Gordon said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There is due process followed to ensure we only include
                    individuals reasonably suspected of crime," he said.

                    Shop staff and "accredited super-recognisers" - analysts
                    with an aptitude for recognising faces - checked every
                    alert, he told BBC News.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mr Gordon disputes the accuracy claims the letter makes
                    about the Met Police's LFR, saying Facewatch is more than
                    99% accurate.

                    Despite creating one of the most recognizable video games of
                    all time, Tetris creators Alexey Pajitnov (who first coded
                    the game in Russia) and Henk Rogers (who was instrumental in
                    bringing the game to prominence in the West) have not been
                    all that recognizable to the general public. That has
                    started to change, though, with the recent release of

                    In Ars Technica's latest Unsolved Mysteries video, Pajitnov
                    and Rogers went all the way back to the game's earliest

                    Proponents like Ticknor say VR can immerse incarcerated
                    people in the sights and sounds of modern life and help them
                    develop digital literacy in a secure corrections
                    environment. "When you're role-playing, when you're learning
                    a new skill, the closer you can bring them to doing what
                    they're actually going to have to do out in the real world,
                    the better," says Ethan Moeller, founder and managing
                    director of Virtual Training Partners, which helps
                    organizations successfully implement virtual-Â­reality
                    tools.Â "VR does that better than any other training medium."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Others are more skeptical. Like Dr. Cyndi Rickards, an
                    associate teaching professor at Drexel University who leads
                    weekly criminology courses inside Philadelphia prisons.
                    People who are incarcerated wear the "label of inmate on
                    their back. It's a dehumanizing system," she says, "so to
                    suggest that VR is going to reintegrate them into society
                    after being in a punitive system...just further objectifies

                    practice for companies to only share their Scope 1 and 2
                    emissions, which can make its carbon footprint appear much
                    smaller than it actually is. Tesla's Scope 1 and 2
                    emissions, for example, only add up to 610,000 metric tons
                    of CO2 in 2022. That's minuscule in comparison to the

                    with that announcement was a stipulation that would also
                    require large companies to report their indirect Scope 3

                    quickly release their own versions, as we did after ChatGPT
                    was released. Farid says that nobody wants to get "left
                    behind," so these companies tend to just release what they
                    have as soon as they can.

                    "It consistently amazes me that in the physical world, when
                    we release products there are really stringent guidelines,"
                    Farid says. "You can't release a product and hope it doesn't
                    kill your customer. But with software, we're like, 'This
                    doesn't really work, but let's see what happens when we
                    release it to billions of people.'"

                    If we start to see a significant number of deepfakes
                    spreading during the election, it's easy to imagine someone
                    like Donald Trump sharing this kind of content on social
                    media and claiming it's real. A deepfake of President Biden
                    saying something disqualifying could come out shortly before
                    the election, and many people might never find out it was
                    AI-generated. Research has consistentlyÂ <a
                      href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-twitter-false-news-travels-faster-true-stories-0308"

                  <p>
                    Even if deepfakes don't become ubiquitous before the 2024
                    election, which is still 18 months away, the mere fact that
                    this kind of content can be created could affect the
                    election. Knowing that fraudulent images, audio, and video
                    can be created relatively easily could make people distrust
                    the legitimate material they come across.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In some respects, deepfakes and generative AI don't even
                    need to be involved in the election for them to still cause
                    disruption, because now the well has been poisoned with this
                    idea that anything could be fake," says Ajder. "That
                    provides a really useful excuse if something inconvenient
                    comes out featuring you. You can dismiss it as fake."

                    However, the difficulty lay in trying to figure out how
                    these synodic periods worked in the context of the 819-day
                    count. Mercury is easy; it has a synodic period of 117 days,
                    which fits into 819 days exactly seven times. But where did
                    the rest of the planets fit?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It turns out that each of the visible planets has a synodic
                    period that exactly matches a number of cycles of the
                    819-day count. Venus' synodic period is 585 days; that
                    matches neatly with 7 counts of 819-days. Mars has a 780-day
                    synodic period; that's exactly 20 counts of 819-days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jupiter and Saturn aren't left out, either. Jupiter's
                    399-day synodic period fits exactly 39 times into 19 counts;
                    and Saturn's 378-day synodic period is a perfect match for 6
                    counts.

                    And there's even a compelling link with the 260-day calendar
                    known as the TzolkÊ¼in. Twenty 819-day periods is a total of
                    16,380 days. If you multiply the Tzolk'in 63 times, you get
                    16,380 days. In fact, 16,380 is the smallest multiple that
                    260 and 819 have in common. So the two link up beautifully
                    with the 20-cycle 819-day count laid out by Linden and
                    Bricker.

                    [...] Any time historians are required to interpret
                    significant measurements of ancient origins, they run the
                    risk of reading too deeply

                    numerology dressed up as academia, though it is important to
                    let science do its work and keep an eye out for critiques
                    and rebuttals.

                    Still, the Maya calendar is far from a simple system based
                    on basic astronomy. We shouldn't be at all surprised that
                    the Maya's measure of the cosmos embraced such a great
                    expanse of space and time.

                    A generation that grew up with Google is forcing professors
                    to rethink their lesson plans
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Catherine Garland, an astrophysicist, started seeing the
                    problem in 2017. She was teaching an engineering course, and
                    her students were using simulation software to model
                    turbines for jet engines. She'd laid out the assignment
                    clearly, but student after student was calling her over for
                    help. They were all getting the same error message: The
                    program couldn't find their files.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Garland thought it would be an easy fix. She asked each
                    student where they'd saved their project. Could they be on
                    the desktop? Perhaps in the shared drive? But over and over,
                    she was met with confusion. "What are you talking about?"
                    multiple students inquired. Not only did they not know where
                    their files were saved â€” they didn't understand the
                    question.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gradually, Garland came to the same realization that many of
                    her fellow educators have reached in the past four years:
                    the concept of file folders and directories, essential to
                    previous generations' understanding of computers, is
                    gibberish to many modern students.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Professors have varied recollections of when they first saw
                    the disconnect. But their estimates (even the most tentative
                    ones) are surprisingly similar. It's been an issue for four
                    years or so, starting â€” for many educators â€” around the fall
                    of 2017.

                    That's approximately when Lincoln Colling, a lecturer in the
                    psychology department at the University of Sussex, told a
                    class full of research students to pull a file out of a
                    specific directory and was met with blank stares. It was the
                    same semester that NicolÃ¡s GuarÃ­n-Zapata, an applied
                    physicist and lecturer at Colombia's Universidad EAFIT,
                    noticed that students in his classes were having trouble
                    finding their documents. It's the same year that posts began
                    to pop up on STEM-educator forums asking for help explaining
                    the concept of a file.

                While some of us may find this phenomenon strange to understand
                it is becoming increasingly real for many. Are there any other
                examples of things that we take for granted becoming
                incomprehensible to those younger that ourselves? I'm not
                thinking of 'hanging up' the telephone, or why the icon for
                saving a file appears to some young people to be a vending
                machine, but things that cause difficulty for others.

                    The move was "bad for Britain" and marked Microsoft's
                    "darkest day" in its four decades of working in the country,
                    Brad Smith told the BBC.

                  <p>
                    The regulator hit back saying it had to do what's best for
                    people, "not merging firms with commercial interests".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The UK's move means the multi-billion dollar deal cannot go
                    ahead globally.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although US and EU regulators have yet to decide on whether
                    to approve the deal, the UK regulator the Competition and
                    Markets Authority (CMA) said: "Activision is intertwined
                    through different markets - it can't be separated for the
                    UK. So this decision blocks the deal from happening
                    globally."

                  <p>
                    If it had been approved, the $68.7bn (Â£55bn) deal would have
                    been the gaming industry's biggest ever takeover, and would
                    have seen Microsoft get hold of massively popular games
                    titles such as Call of Duty, Candy Crush and World of
                    Warcraft.

                    A comet-like asteroid has been flaunting a tail of material
                    as it approaches the Sun. But unlike its cometary
                    counterparts, a fresh look at asteroid Phaethon reveals,
                    this tail is made of sodium rather than dust, as was
                    previously thought.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), a joint
                    mission between NASA and the European Space Agency, recorded
                    <a
                      href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/SOHO_chases_asteroid_s_tail"

                    >
                    of Phaethon as it passed near the Sun in May 2022. SOHO's
                    Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph imaged the
                    asteroid using different filters: one that detects dust and
                    another that detects sodium.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Phaethon's sodium tail adds even more mystery to this
                    strange object. The asteroid was discovered in 1983 and
                    named after the son of the Greek Sun god Helios for its
                    close proximity to the star. Although classified as an
                    asteroid, Phaethon has been showing some comet-like
                    behavior. The rock is the likely origin of the Geminid
                    meteor shower, which streaks across the sky in December.
                    Most meteor showers, however, are produced by comets as a
                    trail of debris left behind during their solar flyby.
                  </p>

                    [...] The discovery of sodium in Phaethon's tail could also
                    hold clues to the origin of its meteor shower. Scientists
                    had previously thought that the asteroid's tail is what
                    crated the Geminid meteor shower, but the latest
                    observations show that the asteroid doesn't shed enough dust
                    for the shower to form. Instead, the researchers behind the
                    new study suggest that a piece of Phaethon broke off around
                    a few thousand years ago, causing the asteroid to eject a
                    stream of billions of bits that make up the Geminids.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists are set to gather more data on Phaethon through
                    an upcoming mission to the asteroid. The Japanese space
                    agency is sending the DESTINY+ mission to the celestial body
                    in 2028 in an attempt to image its surface.

                    [...] The lack of encryption means Google could in theory
                    look at the data and learn what apps and services you use,
                    which can be valuable for a number of purposes, including
                    targeted ads. "Allowing a tech giant thirsty for data like
                    Google to establish a graph of all accounts and services
                    each user has is not a good thing," Mysk said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The issue comes as a surprise, given Google's history with
                    similar tools. Google has a vaguely similar feature that
                    lets you sync data from Google Chrome across devices. There,
                    the company gives users the option to set up a password to
                    protect that data, keeping it away from prying eyes at
                    Google and protecting it from anyone else who might
                    intercept it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "2FA secrets are considered sensitive data, just like
                    passwords. Google already supports passphrases for syncing
                    Chrome data. So we expected that 2FA secrets be treated the
                    same," Mysk said.

                    [...] For some proponents of IVF automation, an even wilder
                    future awaits. By giving over conception to machines,
                    automation could speed the introduction of
                    still-controversial techniques such as genome editing, or
                    advanced methods of creating eggs from stem cells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although MunnÃ© says Overture Life has no plans to modify the
                    genetic makeup of children, he allows it would be a simple
                    matter to use the sperm-injecting robot for that purpose,
                    since it could dispense precise amounts of gene-editing
                    chemicals into an egg. "It should be very easy to add to the
                    machine," he says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even more speculative technology is on the horizon.
                    Fertility machines could gradually evolve into artificial
                    wombs, with children gestated in scientific centers until
                    birth. "I do believe we are going to get there," says
                    Thompson. "There is credible evidence that what we thought
                    was impossible is not so impossible."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Others imagine that robots could eventually be shot into
                    outer space, stocked with eggs and sperm held in a glassy
                    state of stasis. After a thousand-year journey to a distant
                    planet, such machines might boot up and create a new society
                    of humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's all part of the goal of creating more people, and not
                    just here on Earth. "There are people thinking that
                    humankind should be an interplanetary species, and human
                    lifetimes are not going to be enough to reach out to these
                    worlds," says Chavez-Badiola. "Part of the job of a
                    scientist is to keep dreaming."

                    spans domains, components and both public and private
                    organizations. As such, the solution will require a

                    "You have the base stations, you have the links from base
                    stations, to the satellites, and then you've got the
                    satellites themselves," she said. "You also have space

                    The Waabi Driver is the next generation of autonomous
                    trucking technology. It can be trained as a whole, make
                    interpretable decisions, apply learned skills to unseen
                    scenarios and geographies, and adapt to any hardware
                    configuration. The Waabi Driver is a complete solution
                    designed for factory-level OEM integration, large-scale
                    commercialization, and safe deployment.

                  <p>
                    The acquisition includes a $1.5 billion investment over
                    theÂ next few years to upgrade TSI Semiconductors'
                    manufacturing facilities in Roseville, California. Starting
                    in 2026, the first chips will be produced on 200-millimeter
                    wafers based on silicon carbide.

                    News of more chips being produced on U.S. soil is welcome in
                    the automotive world, one of the industries most affected by
                    the global semiconductor shortage that began with the
                    COVID-19 pandemic. The shortage started when factories shut
                    or slowed production due to lockdowns, thus disrupting
                    global supply chains. A surge in demand for electronics as
                    people stayed inside, as well as a boom in demand from an
                    automotive industry determined to go electric and build
                    smarter vehicles, only exacerbated the problem.

                    Electric vehicles on average use more chips than their
                    gas-powered counterparts, and most new EVs hitting the
                    market today promise advanced driver assistance systems and
                    high-tech infotainment systems. As a result, in 2021, the

                    SiCs, which Bosch's new factory will produce, have been a
                    hot commodity among automakers, as well. The company says
                    the market for SiCs has grown by 30% a year on average, and
                    that's in part because they offer greater range and more
                    efficient recharging for EVs. They also lose up to 50% less
                    energy, last longer and require less maintenance.

                  <p>
                    Bosch expects an average of 25 of its chips will be
                    integrated in every new vehicle by 2025.

                        Moreover, for humans it takes years of intensive
                        learning, observation of past creations and practicing
                        to master their craft. At the end of such "training",
                        there is a human creative that can make contributions to
                        cultural diversity with individual works that merit
                        copyright protection. This in turn justifies allowing
                        humans to be "inspired" by existing works. In contrast,
                        AI foundation models use computing infrastructure and
                        algorithms to create output that is similar to the
                        training material, in record time. Despite the
                        "training" such systems do not understand what they are

                    The main argument here is based on the loaded and incorrect
                    term "stolen". Of course, nothing is "stolen" when a digital
                    copy is made for the purpose of machine learning. This is an
                    old rhetorical trick of the copyright industry, and its use
                    here underlines why it should never be accepted.

                  <p>
                    The fact that it takes humans "years of intensive learning"
                    to master a craft, which is better than computers that can
                    do similar things in "record time", is a curious thing to
                    say, and seems to be arguing that slow is somehow inherently
                    better than fast. Perhaps the signatories of the letter want
                    to get rid of modern agriculture too, because it carries out
                    tasks in record time, and lacks "years of intensive
                    learning" to master the craft of farming. Similarly, the
                    idea that people cannot be inspired by generative AI works
                    because they were produced in a different way is
                    narrow-minded and backward-looking. People can be inspired
                    by anything, however it was produced â€“ look at Andy Warhol's
                    output â€“ so surely the more the merrier? [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] AI art won't substitute human works except those
                    involving more mundane and unrewarding tasks, and that
                    should surely be welcomed. It's the same process that saw
                    printing presses replace the mind-numbingly slow and boring
                    process of copying texts manually, letter by letter. To be
                    sure, some quill-wielding scribes became redundant, but the
                    arrival of printing presses led to the creation of an entire
                    modern-style publishing industry employing vastly more
                    people. In the same way, generative AI will see the
                    emergence of many new opportunities based on the technology,
                    with millions of new jobs for creative individuals. The only
                    industries that would fear this are ones that refuse to
                    evolve and embrace it.

                    IBM has taken a longer-than-usual stride towards making its
                    proprietary hardware platforms cloudier, by offering bare
                    metal LinuxONE boxes in the big blue cloud.

                    IBM packs into its z16 mainframe but are designed solely to
                    run Linux â€“ Big Blue's own z/OS is not allowed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But IBM promotes LinuxONE as offering just about the same
                    level of hardware resilience as mainframes. The former
                    typewriter champion also asserts that the LinuxOne
                    architecture teamed with Telum trounces x86 for compute
                    density and energy consumption.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And of course Linux is far less exotic that z/OS, making it
                    a platform more independent software vendors will happily
                    target. IBM reckons greenfield sites might fancy LinuxONE
                    too, as it can run Kubernetes and is therefore suggested as
                    a fine platform for cloud-native development.

                    <i>The Register</i> submits it would be a brave buyer that
                    ignores decades of historical case studies about the perils
                    of lock-in to proprietary platforms and makes LinuxONE the
                    bedrock of a new IT stack. But stranger things have
                    happened.

                    While a portion of the Northwestern device bioresorbs itself
                    into the body, the sensor developed at the University of
                    Sussex is completely biodegradable. It is composed of
                    food-grade algae powder added to a graphene suspension
                    composed of graphite, sodium cholate, and deionized water,
                    then dried to form a nanocomposite sheet. When soaked in a
                    yet another food-grade component â€”a calcium chloride water
                    bathâ€”the sheet swells and creates a conductive hydrogel.

                    measure an object of just 2 milligrams of mass, which the
                    inventors likened to the pressure created by a single

                    The study's corresponding author, Sussex material-physics
                    lecturer Conor Boland, differentiated his lab's work, which
                    uses electromechanical sensing, from the Northwestern
                    bandage, which uses electrochemical sensing, but said both
                    approaches can have legitimate uses in human health care.
                    For example, he said, his team is already working on turning
                    the algae mixture into a material that mimics human skin's
                    mechanical properties, but also has the electronic
                    capabilities to monitor blood pressure and breathing rate.

                    The photo shows the silicon die of the 8086 processor under
                    a microscope. The metal layer on top of the chip is visible,
                    with the silicon hidden underneath. Around the outside edge,
                    bond wires connect pads on the die to the chip's 40 external
                    pins.

                  <p>
                    The highlighted region indicates the 8086's fifteen 16-bit
                    registers and six bytes of instruction prefetch queue.1
                    Registers take up a significant portion of the die, even
                    though they are just 36 bytes in total. Due to space
                    limitations, early microprocessors had a relatively small
                    number of registers; in comparison, a modern processor chip
                    has kilobytes of registers and megabytes of cache storage.2
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The 8086 and other chips of that era were built from a
                    type of transistor called NMOS. These chips consisted of a
                    silicon substrate, which was "doped" by diffusion of arsenic
                    or boron to form transistors. Above the silicon, polysilicon
                    wiring created the gates of the transistors and wired
                    components together. Finally, a metal layer on top provided
                    more wiring. (Modern processors, in comparison, use CMOS
                    technology, which combines NMOS and PMOS transistors, and
                    they have many metal layers.)

                    [...] At the end of the experiment, the team drenched the
                    soil. All the trees recovered well by most measures: Rates
                    of photosynthesis in the previously parched trees caught up
                    to the rates of trees in the control groups and embolisms
                    filled with water.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But when Beikircher measured the trees' resistance to an
                    electrical current, an indication of moisture levels deep
                    within trunks, the spruces' water reserves were still
                    depleted. One season of rain was not enough to help these
                    trees fully recover. It's unclear whether spruces can
                    replenish their reserves after prolonged drought or how long
                    that might take.

                    and intense (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>). That means the
                    compositions of the trees that make up the world's temperate
                    forests could change as the climate warms, with uncertain
                    consequences for the other plants and animals in these
                    ecosystems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Beikircher plans to test whether a more diverse forest could
                    help drought-sensitive species like the spruce survive.
                    Deep-rooted beeches interspersed with spruces might help
                    increase moisture in the soil's upper levels by wicking
                    water up to where spruce roots are, she says.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Manuel Hermosilla
                    received a call from a family friend in Chile who had been
                    recently diagnosed with cancer. The friend needed help
                    tracking down Hydroxychloroquine to treat her rheumatoid
                    arthritisâ€”a drug in short supply given its supposed
                    therapeutic powers to combat COVID-19.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hermosilla found two alternatives for Hydroxychloroquine: a
                    generic version for about $15 a month and the branded
                    version for a hefty $330. The family friend didn't want the
                    generic version, Hermosilla says. "Given her cancer
                    diagnosis, she felt the generic wasn't 'safe' enoughâ€”which
                    got me to thinking: could medical-related insecurities
                    impact patients' brand/generic choices?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Getting bad medical news can be alarming. It might influence
                    us to embark on a healthier lifestyle, perhaps by exercising
                    more or eating healthier food. Given that brand name drugs
                    are perceived to be more effective and perhaps even safer
                    than generics (despite many experts viewing generics as
                    molecular replicas of brand name drugs), bad news might also
                    affect how we choose between drugs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This new research points to estimates suggesting substantial
                    savings for the U.S. healthcare systemâ€” about 10% of drug
                    expenditures, or $36 billion a yearâ€”if patients always chose
                    a generic option when available. The researchers suggest
                    that a broader use of generics could significantly lower
                    expenditures without sacrificing the quality of patient
                    care.

                    The chip continues to receive excessive current through the
                    motherboard socket during this death spiral of sorts, thus
                    leading to the visible damage we can see in the socket to
                    the vCore pins and the bulging on the chip's LGA pads.
                    However, less visible damage also extends to the CPU SoC,
                    CPU_VDDCR_SOC, and CPU VDD MISC rails/pins â€” they just don't
                    pull enough current to leave visible scorching like we see
                    with the vCore pins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We do know that 1.25V is the recommended safe SoC voltage
                    limit, and we're told that 1.4V and beyond definitely
                    increases the <em>likelihood</em> of the condition
                    occurring. To be clear, running beyond 1.4V doesn't ensure
                    that your chip will burn out, but your odds will increase.
                    Conversely, 1.35V appears to be "safe." Proceed at your own
                    risk, though.

                  <p>
                    Our sources say that AMD is working on a fix that includes a
                    voltage cap or lock in the firmware/SMU, which should
                    prevent EXPO memory profiles and simple BIOS manipulations
                    from exceeding an as-yet-undefined limit. We're also told
                    that AMD can't completely prevent SoC voltage manipulations
                    because the amount fed to the chip is dictated by the VRMs,
                    leaving a means for crafty motherboard vendors to allow
                    voltage changes despite AMD's lock (this would not be the
                    first time motherboard vendors have circumvented limits to
                    offer rare functionalities).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A few motherboard vendors, like ASUS and MSI, have already
                    issued new BIOSes to correct some of the issues. However, we
                    have confirmed that failures have also occurred on Biostar,
                    ASRock, and Gigabyte boards, so all vendors are impacted to
                    some degree.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As with all forms of overclocking, any damage from using an
                    EXPO overclocking profile is not covered by your warranty,
                    but given the situation, we don't think that AMD or the
                    motherboard vendors would use the lack of warrantied EXPO
                    support to invalidate warranties.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The advertised performance you get from an EXPO profile is
                    also not guaranteed by the chipmaker. It's also noteworthy
                    that AMD's purportedly planned SoC voltage cap could lead to
                    lower stable memory overclocking frequencies. However, we
                    don't think that will matter too much to most Ryzen 7000
                    owners, as the sweet spot DDR5-6000 should work just fine
                    within the proposed limits. However, extreme overclockers
                    and those pushing the very bleeding edge of performance
                    could end up with lower overclocking limits. Time will tell.

                    Makers of these tinkly eyedrops claim they can treat eye
                    conditions, namely dry eyes and inflammation. Any such
                    biologic-based product claiming to cure or treat a condition
                    is regulated by the FDA under the Public Health Service Act
                    and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. As such, these
                    products require an investigational new drug application (an
                    IND) to be tested in humans and a full FDA approval before
                    hitting the market.

                    This appears to have been news to at least two companies
                    that the FDA sent warning letters to late last year. The
                    companies,
                    <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/162219/download"

                    <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/163465/download"

                    >
                    [PDF], were illegally selling unapproved eye drops, which
                    the FDA said contained amniotic-fluid, to treat dry eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In fact, there is not a single amniotic-fluid eye drop
                    product approved by the FDA, and any such product used under
                    an IND requires patients to sign consent forms. Yet, the FDA
                    is finding these products on the market, the regulator said
                    in its notification.

              <p>
                Wait, what? Amniotic fluid? Whether it works or not (probably
                not), I want to know how these companies can harvest enough to
                make commercial quantities of their products.

                    To see these dips in brightness, though, you need to observe
                    the star in question at several different points. First, you
                    need to see the star at its usual brightness, then during
                    the transit, then after the transit. And scientists like to
                    observe these transits multiple times so they can be sure
                    that what they are seeing is definitely due to the presence
                    of a planet and not another factor. That's why TESS gathers
                    so much data â€” because it needs to observe lots of stars and
                    see them at multiple points in time to know whether they
                    have planets orbiting them.

                    [...] TESS has already completed its two-year primary
                    mission and is now on its extended mission, but it continues
                    to operate well so we can expect it to continue discovering
                    many more exoplanets in the years to come.

                    Imagine the horrified looks you'd get if you dropped your
                    paper coffee cup on the ground, stepped on it and walked
                    away. A startup based in San Francisco and Germany says you
                    can do exactly that with its cups, guilt-free.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <a href="https://gaeastar.com/">GaeaStar</a> is getting
                    ready to introduce its 3D-printed, disposable clay cups to
                    the US, after a successful trial period at coffee shops and
                    ice cream parlors in Berlin. Watch the video above to learn

                    The cups are made from just three ingredients: dirt, salt
                    and a small amount of water. Founder and CEO Sanjeev
                    Mankotia told CNET he had the idea when he was visiting
                    family in India and his cousin was drinking chai from a
                    terracotta cup she bought from a street vendor. "She drank
                    the cup, and then smashed it on the ground. And I was like,
                    'You're throwing something away that's creating litter.' And
                    her reaction was, "It's made out of dirt, why is this an
                    issue?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those terracotta cups, or "Kuhlars" have been used in South
                    Asia for 5,000 years. They are typically never reused.

                  <p>
                    [...] According to GaeaStar, it can print a ceramic cup
                    using about 60% less energy than it takes to create a
                    plastic or paper cup, for about the same price. "When you
                    scale it up, we feel that this could be priced in parallel
                    or comparable to the incumbent cups in the market, if not
                    cheaper."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] GaeaStar's long-term goal is to put its patent-pending
                    3D-printers in shops around the US, where cups could be
                    printed on-demand in about 10 seconds. Mankotia says dirt
                    can be sourced locally to save energy. In the meantime,
                    you'll be able to find them in select

                    of the most advanced chips," he confirms.

                    Massoud's group researches emerging technology that could
                    make chips more secure. A recent project reports
                    multifunctional logic gates that offer users a range of
                    hardware security advantages. These include better control
                    over their devices, tamper protection, watermarking and
                    fingerprinting, and layout camouflage.

                    "Even if a semiconductor foundry is highly trustworthy, an
                    untrusted entity in the supply chain could tamper with
                    chips," Massoud says.

                    [...] As a secure alternative, Kumar and colleagues explored
                    polymorphic gates made from nanoscale structures consisting
                    of an oxide layer sandwiched between two ferromagnetic
                    layers. These structures, known as a magnetic tunnel
                    junctions (MTJ), are easily switchable by reversing the
                    relative orientation of magnetic spins of the ferromagnetic
                    layers. This spin-based control makes MTJs examples of
                    spintronic devices.

                  <p>
                    Kumar and colleagues thought the switchable properties of
                    MTJs meant that they could be used to create polymorphic
                    gates, whose configuration users could check and
                    reconfigure, overwriting any nefarious settings. They showed
                    that MTJs function as polymorphic gates in a way that
                    prevents tampering and intellectual property piracy due to
                    their symmetry at both circuit and layout level symmetry,
                    obscuring their layout and making them hard to reverse

                    >, researchers report April 11 in
                    <em>Advanced Functional Materials</em>. The team made a
                    self-healing leather from mushrooms' threadlike structures
                    called mycelium, building on past iterations of the material
                    to allow it to fix itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mycelium leather is already an emerging product, but it's
                    produced in a way that extinguishes fungal growth. Elise
                    Elsacker and colleagues speculated that if the production
                    conditions were tweaked, the mycelium could retain its
                    ability to regrow if damaged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That novel approach could offer inspiration to other
                    researchers trying to get into the mycelium leather market,
                    says Valeria La Saponara, a mechanical and aerospace
                    engineer at the University of California, Davis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Elsacker, a bioengineer now at the Vrije Universiteit
                    Brussel, and her colleagues first grew mycelium in a soup
                    rich in proteins, carbohydrates and other nutrients. A skin
                    formed on the surface of the liquid, which the scientists
                    scooped off, cleaned and dried to make a thin, somewhat
                    fragile leather material. They used temperatures and
                    chemicals mild enough to form the leather but leave parts of
                    the fungus functional. Left dormant were chlamydospores,
                    little nodules on the mycelium that can spring back to life
                    and grow more mycelium when conditions are prime.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After punching holes in the leather, the researchers doused
                    the area in the same broth used to grow it to revive the
                    chlamydospores. The mycelium eventually regrew over the
                    punctures. Once healed, the hole-punched areas were just as
                    strong as undamaged areas â€” however, the repairs were
                    visible from one side of the leather.

                    After five long months journeying through space, ispace's
                    Hakuto-R lander is ready to greet the lunar surface.The
                    Japanese company is expecting to land Hakuto-R at
                    <b>12:40 PM EST today</b>. If successful, this first mission
                    will no doubt be a huge boon for ispace's ambitious plans to
                    send two subsequent landers to the moon in 2024 and 2025. It
                    would also make them the first private company to land on
                    the moon, and the first spacecraft from Japan to do so.
                    (China, the United States, and the USSR have been the only
                    nations to reach the lunar surface.)This first mission,
                    appropriately named Mission 1, kicked off last December when
                    a SpaceX Falcon 9 launched the lander into space. Since
                    then, the lander has performed a number of maneuvers to stay
                    on track in its path to the moon. At its farthest point,
                    Hakuto-R traveled as much as 1.4 million kilometers from
                    Earth.

                    Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers (CIVICs).

                    In a phase 1 clinical trial of 52 volunteers, the vaccine
                    developed by the VRC â€“ known as H1ssF (influenza H1
                    hemagglutinin stabilized stem ferritin nanoparticle vaccine)
                    â€“ was safe, well-tolerated, and induced broad antibody
                    responses that target the hemagglutinin stem. The two new
                    studies assessing the nanoparticle vaccine published April
                    19 in Science Translational Medicine.

                    Linux 6.3 has arrived after a push that project boss Linus
                    Torvalds characterized as "a nice, controlled release cycle"
                    that required the seven release candidates he prefers and
                    was supported by helpful developer behavior.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It happens," he added, but also didn't rule out "something
                    nasty couldn't have been lurking all these weeks." Torvalds

                    Holidays and travel are often the cause of delays to kernel
                    releases. Easter didn't slow development this time around.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Version 6.3 won't be a long term support (LTS) release â€“ the
                    last of those was Linux 6.1, and every fifth or sixth
                    release gets LTS status. So while many users will be pleased
                    to see it, 6.3 almost certainly won't be a cut of the kernel
                    that demands adoption or attention.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Which is not to say it doesn't include some interesting
                    goodies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among the additions are better support for multi-actuator
                    hard disk drives. Conventional hard disks have one actuator
                    driving a single set of read/write heads. Multi-actuator
                    disks add a second set of heads, which speeds things up
                    nicely. Hyperscale cloud operators are the first big buyers
                    of multi-actuator disks, but they're slowly going
                    mainstream. Now Linux is better able to handle them.

                    China's Loongson makes RISC-V processors and is working hard
                    and fast to make them an enterprise contender. Linux 6.3
                    will help that a little by supporting Kernel Address Space
                    Layout Randomization on the company's silicon. This has been
                    around on other architectures for ages â€“ security is helped
                    by having the kernel load into different areas of memory
                    each time it boots, instead of using the same locations and
                    giving attackers a known target.

                    To determine whether the fallacy necessarily involves
                    language and whether it is unique to humans, GonzÃ¡lez
                    engaged rats in a physical, not social, task. With
                    psychology professor Aaron Blaisdell, she designed two
                    experiments that required the rats to judge the likelihood
                    of just a sound being present or both a light and sound
                    being present in order to receive a food reward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The tendency to overestimate the likelihood that both
                    sound and light were present, even if it meant no reward,
                    demonstrates that, like humans, rats can show a conjunction
                    fallacy, the authors said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Until now, researchers said this is unique to human
                    cognition only because we haven't looked for it in animals,"
                    Blaisdell said. "If humans and other animals consider
                    alternative states of the world during ambiguous situations
                    to help decision-making, we might expect systematic biases
                    such as the conjunction fallacy to show a broader
                    distribution in the animal kingdom."

                  <p>
                    In an email to staff shared with NBC News, BuzzFeed CEO
                    Jonah Peretti said the move was part of a 15% workforce
                    reduction across a number of teams.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "While layoffs are occurring across nearly every division,
                    we've determined that the company can no longer continue to
                    fund BuzzFeed News as a standalone organization," he wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Peretti said he had "overinvest[ed] in BuzzFeed News
                    "because I love their work and mission so much."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This made me slow to accept that the big platforms wouldn't
                    provide the distribution or financial support required to
                    support premium, free journalism purpose-built for social
                    media," he wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He added that he had failed to "hold the company to higher
                    standards for profitability" to give it a buffer for
                    downturns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moving forward, BuzzFeed will have a lone news brand,
                    HuffPost, which BuzzFeed acquired in 2020 and which Peretti
                    said "is profitable, with a loyal direct front page
                    audience."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] BuzzFeed News launched in earnest at the outset of
                    2012 after it named longtime New York City political
                    reporter Ben Smith as its editor-in-chief. In 2021, the news
                    organization won a Pulitzer Prize for a series exposing
                    China's mass detention of Muslims. That same year, it was
                    also named a Pulitzer finalist â€” the second time it had
                    received the honor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Later that year, BuzzFeed Inc. became a publicly traded
                    company amid a global frenzy of reverse mergers, many of
                    which have since lost significant value. In BuzzFeed's case,
                    it never traded above its initial public offering price of
                    about $10.

                    Driving in thick fog is a big enough challenge for humans,
                    but it turns out self-driving cars find it pretty tricky,
                    too.

                    Overwhelmed by dense fog in San Francisco early on Tuesday
                    morning, five of Waymo's fully driverless vehicles suddenly
                    parked by the side of a residential street in what appeared
                    to be a precautionary measure, the San Francisco Chronicle
                    <a
                      href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/san-francisco-waymo-stopped-in-street-17890821.php"
                      >reported</a
                    >. Another of its cars apparently came to halt in the middle
                    of the street, the news outlet said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other vehicles were unable to pass as "baffled motorists
                    flashed headlights and tried to maneuver around the jam,"
                    the Chronicle said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The traffic problems persisted until the fog cleared and the
                    autonomous cars were able to resume their journeys.

                    [...] Ninety percent of the viruses found by the researchers
                    are bacterial viruses â€“ known as bacteriophages. These
                    viruses have bacteria as their hosts and do not attack the
                    children's own cells, meaning that they do not cause
                    disease. The hypothesis is that bacteriophages primarily
                    serve as allies:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We work from the assumption that bacteriophages are largely
                    responsible for shaping bacterial communities and their
                    function in our intestinal system. Some bacteriophages can
                    provide their host bacterium with properties that make it
                    more competitive by integrating its own genome into the
                    genome of the bacterium. When this occurs, a bacteriophage
                    can then increase a bacterium's ability to absorb
                    <em>e.g</em>. various carbohydrates, thereby allowing the
                    bacterium to metabolise more things," explains Dennis
                    Sandris Nielsen, who continues:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The remaining ten percent of viruses found in the
                    children are eukaryotic â€“ that is, they use human cells as
                    hosts. These can be both friends and foes for us:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It is thought-provoking that all children run around with
                    10-20 of these virus types that infect human cells. So,
                    there is a constant viral infection taking place, which
                    apparently doesn't make them sick. We just know very little
                    about what's really at play. My guess is that they're
                    important for training our immune system to recognise
                    infections later. But it may also be that they are a risk
                    factor for diseases that we have yet to discover," says
                    Dennis Sandris Nielsen.

                    What ultimately initiated that disintegration isn't
                    completely clear, Dan Dumbacher, executive director of the
                    American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, told
                    Mashable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Now it's a pure race as to whether the aerodynamic pressure
                    breaks the vehicle up or the flight termination system
                    does," he said, "but it really doesn't matter because the
                    end result is the same."

                  <p>
                    As Starship ascended, cameras caught views of the array of
                    flames underneath it, appearing to show some of the engines
                    were out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There's a lot of risk associated with this first launch, so
                    I would not say that it is likely to be successful," [Elon
                    Musk] said during a video conference with a National
                    Academies panel in 2021. "But I think we will make a lot of
                    progress."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite Starship never having reached space, industry
                    experts largely regarded the launch as a partial success
                    because the rocket managed to clear the launch tower and
                    traveled higher than any Starship prototype had before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, the general public seemed unsure of how to think
                    of the whole thing: After all, usually, when something big
                    and expensive goes boom, it's considered bad. But SpaceX has
                    always approached rocketry differently from NASA, working a
                    little messier and faster to achieve its goals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In terms of the explosive ending, Dumbacher said spaceport
                    safety officers are required to terminate a flight if a
                    rocket meanders into an area where the risk of debris
                    hitting someone on the ground could exceed a probability of
                    one in 30 million. "People ought to be looking at this as
                    good â€” the flight termination system, if it was needed,
                    actually worked," he said.

                    High-performance microprocessors tend to get hot and, when
                    overclocked without proper cooling or throttling, can
                    literally burn out When an old CPU does so in an old PC
                    because of dust and a worn out fan, there is nothing
                    surprising about it. But when a new CPU breaks on a shiny
                    new motherboard, that's surprising. This is what happened to

                    "The CPU pad is physically bulging," wrote Speedrookie, the
                    owner of the burned-out processor. "I imagine there was just
                    too much heat on the contacts causing the pad to expand. Not
                    that the CPU has an internal component which exploded."

                    At least when it comes to AMD's Ryzen 7000X3D-series

                    There are about a million of reasons why a modern processor
                    can burn out. Defective sockets or a motherboards [sic] are
                    likely causes and insufficient cooling can cause a similar
                    result. A BIOS version that tends to automatically overclock
                    CPUs too much could be a yet another reason for a processor
                    failure. In fact, as noticed by HXL
                    <a
                      href="https://twitter.com/9550pro/status/1649621031588630529"
                      >(@9550pro</a
                    >), Asus has just withdrew old BIOSes for many of its AMD
                    X670-based motherboards, but for some of them old BIOSes are
                    still available.

                    [...] Again, given that the information is insufficient to
                    say the least, we cannot make any conclusions at this point.
                    We'll reach out to our contacts at AMD and the motherboard
                    vendors to see if they are aware of any issues. For now, we
                    recommend that those with AMD's Ryzen 7000X3D processors
                    keep a close eye on their CPU temps, use adequate cooling
                    and keep their BIOSes up-to-date.

                    16 micrograms is roughly equivalent to the mass of a grain
                    of sand, and that's a very fat cat on a quantum level. It's
                    "several billion times heavier than an atom or molecule,
                    making it the fattest quantum cat to date," according to the
                    release. It's not the first time physicists have tested
                    whether quantum behaviors can be observed in classical
                    objects. Last year, a different team declared they had
                    quantum-entangled a tardigrade, though a number of
                    physicists told Gizmodo that claim was poppycock.

                  <p>
                    This is slightly different, as the recent team was just
                    testing the mass of an object in a quantum state, not the
                    possibility of entangling a living thing. While that's not
                    in the team's plans, working with even larger masses "will
                    allow us to better understand the reason behind the
                    disappearance of quantum effects in the macroscopic world of
                    real cats," Chu said.

                  <p>
                    [...] As for the true boundary between the two worlds? "No
                    one knows," wrote Matteo Fadel, a physicist at ETH Zurich
                    and a co-author of the paper, in an email to Gizmodo.
                    "That's the interesting thing, and the reason why
                    demonstrating quantum effects in systems of increasing mass
                    is so groundbreaking."

                    The new research takes SchrÃ¶dinger's famous thought
                    experiment and gives it some practical applications.
                    Controlling quantum materials in superposition could be
                    useful in a number of fields that require very precise
                    measurements; for example, helping reduce noise in the
                    interferometers that measure gravitational waves.

                    The quantum world ripe for new discoveries, but alas, it's
                    crammed full of unknowables, dead ends, and vexing new
                    problems.

                    [...] The farmed mink in Poland again highlight the risk of
                    spillbacks by suggesting an unknown reservoir of SARS-CoV-2
                    in wild animals. In an investigation, researchers at
                    National Veterinary Research Institute and Erasmus
                    University Medical Centre looked into cases at three farms
                    within 8 km (about 5 miles) of each other. The first farm
                    reported two infected mink (out of 15 tested and about 8,650
                    animals total) on September 19, but they subsequently tested
                    negative and were pelted as scheduled. On November 16, a
                    second farm with 4,000 mink reported six infected animals
                    out of 15 tested, and they were pelted with precautions. The
                    third farm, with 1,100 mink, found 15 infected animals out
                    of 15 tested on January 18, but they subsequently tested
                    negative in two rounds of testing within 50 days. All of the
                    infected animals on the three farms were asymptomatic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers obtained eight whole genome sequencesâ€”four
                    each from the second and third farms; there wasn't enough
                    genetic material in samples from the first farm. The genome
                    sequences showed they were nearly identical and most closely
                    matched the lineage B.1.1.307, which hadn't been seen in
                    humans in Poland in over two years. The viruses also had 40
                    small genetic mutations, some of which have previously been
                    associated with circulation in mink, and could have been
                    acquired quickly. None of the farm families or workers
                    tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at any of the three farms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers noted that all three farms had concrete
                    fences 1.8 meters (6 feet) high and about 30â€“40 cm (around a
                    foot) deep. There was no evidence of animals burrowing under
                    the fences, but the researchers noted overhanging tree
                    branches that could have created a route for wild animals.
                    Interviews with owners and staff revealed that the farms
                    were occasionally visited by wild martens, weasel-like
                    carnivores. And there were also feral cats around. The
                    researchers tested feral cat droppings around the farms but
                    found they were negative for SARS-CoV-2.

                    JAXA is getting ready to visit Mars's two moons, but Japan's
                    space agency is no longer going alone.

                  <p>
                    This week, NASA signed a memorandum of understanding with
                    JAXA to join its upcoming mission to the two Martian moons,
                    Phobos and Deimos, which is scheduled to launch in 2024.
                    NASA has assembled a team of scientists and prepared two
                    instruments to board JAXA's spacecraft to Mars, the space
                    agency

                    The Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission will not only
                    visit the two mysterious moons that whirl around Mars, it
                    will also land on the cratered surface of Phobos to snag a
                    sample from the largest of the two moons.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's an ambitious plan as no spacecraft has successfully
                    ventured to the Martian moons before, let alone land on one.
                    JAXA, however, has some experience in returning samples from
                    cosmic bodies. The Japanese space agency's Hayabusa
                    spacecraft retrieved

                    [...] The main purpose of the mission is to analyze the
                    origins of the Martian moons and determine whether they are
                    in fact captured asteroids in the Mars system or fragments
                    that coalesced together following a huge impact on the Red
                    Planet. The mission could help scientists better understand
                    how terrestrial planets like Mars form and learn more about
                    the history of the planet.

                    computing magazines. I still have fond memories of typing
                    out the computer programs in the back pages of some
                    publications; I even submitted a few of my own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When high-speed internet came along, many computing
                    publications began producing digital versions of their
                    magazines online. Those with subscriptions still got their
                    physical copies, but the online component was a nice perk
                    for when readers could not just pick up a magazine and start
                    reading, like at work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before long, most computing magazines had online versions
                    and, at some point, started ditching paper. It was easier
                    and cheaper to publish one copy that all subscribers could
                    access online rather than printing hundreds of thousands of
                    physical versions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The demise of print media in the computing industry
                    was inevitable. By the 2000s, many prominent magazines had
                    shut down their printing arms and switched to digital only.
                    Byte stopped printing in 1998. Windows Magazine crashed in
                    2002, and the succinctly titled PC Magazine (now PCMag)
                    published its last issue in 2009. Computer Gaming World went
                    entirely out of business with its November 2006 issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Print advertising also played a big part in the
                    decline of computer publications. Once advertisers realized
                    replicating ads on web pages was cheap and easy, they
                    gradually pulled out of print computer magazines. Many
                    physical magazine branches shut down for that reason alone.
                    If the pub didn't have the clout of names like PC Magazine,
                    Maximum PC, or PC World, it had no chance of competing
                    against the internet for ad space. Even the almanac-like
                    Computer Shopper plunged from nearly 360,000 readers in 1996
                    to about 55,000 in 2014.

                    He added: "Remarkably, 80% of the mass in the universe is
                    invisible. By mapping the dark matter distribution across
                    the sky to the largest distances, our ACT lensing
                    measurements allow us to clearly see this invisible world."

                    [...] Sherwin added, "Our results also provide new insights
                    into an ongoing debate some have called 'The Crisis in
                    Cosmology.'" This "crisis" stems from recent measurements
                    that use a different background light, one emitted from
                    stars in galaxies rather than the CMB. These have produced
                    results that suggest the dark matter was not lumpy enough
                    under the standard model of cosmology and led to concerns
                    that the model may be broken. However, the ACT team's latest
                    results precisely assessed that the vast lumps seen in this
                    image are the exact right size.

                    "While earlier studies pointed to cracks in the standard
                    cosmological model, our findings provide new reassurance
                    that our fundamental theory of the universe holds true,"

                    [...] Black said: "On the question about escalation: in
                    general, we don't have particularly good theory for
                    understanding how to deter non-state actors. A lot of the
                    deterrence theory [has] evolved out of Cold War nuclear
                    deterrence in the USSR, USA and the West. It is not really
                    configured the same way to think about non-state actors,
                    particularly those which have very decentralized, loose
                    non-hierarchical network command structures, which don't
                    lend themselves to influencing in the same way as a
                    traditional top-down military adversary."

                  <p>
                    The situation with AI-enhanced weapons was different from
                    earlier military analysis in that the private sector is way
                    ahead of government research, which was not the case with
                    physical threats, he said.

                    [...] Last month, hundreds of computer scientists, tech
                    industry leaders, and AI experts signed an
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/29/uk_seeks_lighttouch_ai_legislation/"
                      >open letter</a
                    >
                    calling for a pause for at least six months in the training
                    of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. Signatories included
                    Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, and
                    IEEE computing pioneer Grady Booch.

                  <p>
                    But the prospect of a pause was wholly unrealistic, Payne
                    said. "It reflects the degree of societal unease about the
                    rapid pace of change that people feel is coming down the
                    tracks towards them. But I don't think it is a realistic
