                    He also used a script to ping all of the IPv4 addresses in
                    order to gauge how many were "alive" within the AWS network
                    and came up with an answer of about 6 million. But many
                    instances on AWS will have a security policy to not respond
                    to a ping packet, so the actual number of active IPv4
                    addresses could be double that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even with just those six million addresses, that's $262.8
                    million AWS will earn from charging for IPv4 in a year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He forecast the headline $400 million to $1 billion figure
                    by projecting a "conservative" estimate that between 10
                    percent and 30 percent of the IPv4 addresses (approximately
                    7.9 million) published in the
                    <a
                      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/aws-ip-ranges.html"

                    are used for a year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We asked AWS if it recognized any of these figures, and what
                    the company itself estimated it would earn from charging
                    customers for public IPv4 addresses, but it declined to
                    answer, instead referring us to its original blog post
                    disclosing the charges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The general feeling among industry experts is that this is
                    fair game, and customers should make plans to migrate to
                    IPv6 if they don't like it – assuming their applications
                    allow this, of course.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "My view is that AWS has been smart in buying up IPv4
                    addresses, and this is a way for it to cash in until IPv6
                    adoption makes IPv4 redundant. It's just that organizations
                    are not rushing to move to IPv6," he said.

              <p>
                Everyone knows we should be doing backups. While the standard
                these days is an online backup (too expensive for a full backup,
                I use it for important, small things,) or using an external hard
                drive, SSDs can lose their data after a few years of not being
                powered on and hard drives are complicated mechanical beasts
                susceptible to their grease hardening, bearings seizing, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                The best option if I want long term backups is to grab good
                quality blurays and a burner. Is anyone else out there doing
                this? How are you handling splitting up your data (who only has
                32gb of data these days?) Do you just have a dedicated spot on
                your hard drive to stage backups before burning or are there
                some software tricks on modern computers like the old days to
                burn a single "file" across multiple discs? How far back a
                backup have you recovered, now that bluray's going on 20 years
                old?

                    In the new study, the researchers experimented with
                    superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors. In each
                    device, a 40-nanometer-wide niobium titanium nitride wire
                    was cooled to about 2 kelvins (about –271 °C), rendering the
                    wire superconductive. A single photon could disrupt this
                    fragile state, generating electrical pulses that enabled the
                    efficient detection of individual photons.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The scientists contorted the nanowire in each device into a
                    fractal pattern that took on similar shapes at various
                    magnifications. This let the sensor detect photons of all
                    polarizations, boosting its efficiency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new detector was up to nearly three times as efficient
                    as other single-photon detectors at sensing near- and
                    mid-infrared light. This let the researchers perform
                    non-line-of-sight imaging, achieving a spatial resolution of
                    roughly 1.3 to 1.5 centimeters.

                    [...] The Vesuvius Challenge co-founders thought when they
                    started the challenge that there was less than a 30 percent
                    chance of success within the year, since, at the time, no
                    one had been able to read actual letters inside of a scroll.
                    However, the crowdsourcing approach proved wildly
                    successful. It's still just 5 percent of a single scroll, so
                    Friedman, Searles, and Gross have announced a new challenge
                    for 2024: $100,000 for the first entry that can read 90
                    percent of the four scrolls scanned thus far.

                  <p>
                    Researchers have discovered a non-opioid compound that, in
                    mice, effectively reduced the pain hypersensitivity
                    associated with chronic and often debilitating nerve pain
                    caused by diabetes or chemotherapy drugs. It's opened the
                    door to developing a drug to treat the condition for which
                    existing painkillers do little.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Diabetes, chemotherapy drugs, multiple sclerosis, injuries
                    and amputations have all been associated with neuropathic
                    pain, usually caused by damage to nerves in various body
                    tissues, including the skin, muscles and joints. Mechanical
                    hypersensitivity – or mechanical allodynia – is a major
                    symptom of neuropathic pain, where innocuous stimuli like
                    light touch cause severe pain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many available pain medications aren't effective in reducing
                    this often-debilitating type of chronic pain. However,
                    researchers at the University of Texas at Austin (UT
                    Austin), in collaboration with UT Dallas and the University
                    of Miami, may have advanced the treatment of neuropathic
                    pain by discovering a molecule that reduces mechanical
                    hypersensitivity in mice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We found it to be an effective painkiller, and the effects
                    were rather long-lived," said Stephen Martin, a
                    co-corresponding author of the study. "When we tested it on
                    different models, diabetic neuropathy and
                    chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, for example, we found this
                    compound has an incredible beneficial effect."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "It's our goal to make this compound into a drug that
                    can be used to treat chronic pain without the dangers of
                    opioids," Martin said. "Neuropathic pain is often a
                    debilitating condition that can affect people their entire
                    lives, and we need a treatment that is well tolerated and
                    effective."

                    The European Parliament has reached a provisional deal on EU
                    regulations to strengthen consumers' right to repair.

                    - the rules were first proposed in March 2022, and the hope
                    is that new requirements will be finalized in 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The thinking is that consumers should be better informed
                    about the lifespan and repairability of products before
                    buying them, and there should be measures to boost repair
                    after the legal guarantee period has expired.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All told, the bill looks set to bolster the repair sector.
                    Manufacturers must make spare parts and tools available for
                    "a reasonable price" and be prohibited from using
                    contractual clauses or hardware or software blocks to
                    obstruct repairs. While singling no company out
                    specifically, the European Parliament said: "In particular,
                    they should not impede the use of second-hand or 3D issued
                    spare parts by independent repairers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other consumer rights in the deal include options for
                    borrowing a device while their own is being repaired or
                    opting for a refurbished unit, an additional one-year
                    extension of the legal guarantee for repaired goods, and
                    free online access to indicative repair prices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under the regulation, manufacturers must inform customers of
                    the duty to repair and be obligated to fix "common household
                    products," such as a washing machine or smartphone. The
                    European Parliament has left open the possibility of adding
                    more items over time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It will be a while before this all goes into effect,
                    though. Once both Council and Parliament adopt the
                    directive, member states will have 24 months to get it into
                    national law.

                        manufacturers such as Hynix, Sandisk, or Samsung that
                        had failed quality control were being resold and
                        repurposed. While still working, the chips' storage
                        capacity is reduced.

                        "When we opened defective USB sticks last year, we found
                        an alarming number of inferior memory chips with reduced
                        capacity and the manufacturer's logo removed from the
                        chip. Clearly discarded and unrecognizable microSD cards
                        are also soldered onto a USB stick and managed with the
                        external one on the USB stick board instead of the
                        microSD's internal controller," explains Conrad

                        [...] Technological advancements have also affected
                        these NAND chips, but not in a good way. The chips
                        originally used single-level cell (SLC) memory cells
                        that only stored one bit each, offering less data
                        density but better performance and reliability. In order
                        to increase the amount of storage the chips offered,
                        manufacturers started moving to four bits per cell
                        (QLC), decreasing the endurance and retention. Combined
                        with the questionable components, it's why CBL warns
                        that "You shouldn't rely too much on the reliability of
                        flash memory."

                    Microsoft opened its arms to Linux during the Windows 10

                    or update software, or to make changes to system files.
                    Users who aren't in the sudo user group on a given system
                    can't run the command, protecting the rest of the files on

                    with the setting in a build of Windows Server 2025, which
                    currently requires Developer Mode to be enabled in the
                    Settings app. There's a toggle to turn the sudo command on
                    and off and a separate drop-down to tweak how the command
                    behaves when you use it, though as of this writing the
                    command itself doesn't actually work yet.

                  <p>
                    The sudo command is also part of the Windows Subsystem for
                    Linux (WSL), but that version of the sudo command only
                    covers Linux software. This one seems likely to run native
                    Windows commands, though obviously we won't know exactly how
                    it works before it's enabled and fully functional.
                    Currently, users who want a sudo-like command in Windows
                    need to rely on
                    <a href="https://github.com/gerardog/gsudo"
                      >third-party software like gsudo</a
                    >
                    to accomplish the task.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The benefit of the sudo command for Windows users—whether
                    they're using Windows Server or otherwise—would be the
                    ability to elevate the privilege level without having to
                    open an entirely separate command prompt or Windows Terminal
                    window. According to the options available in the preview
                    build, commands run with sudo could be opened up in a new
                    window automatically, or they could happen inline, but you'd
                    never need to do the "right-click, run-as-administrator"
                    dance again if you didn't want to.

                    Microsoft is working with media startup Semafor to use its
                    artificial intelligence chatbot to help develop news
                    stories—part of a journalistic outreach that comes as the
                    tech giant faces a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from the New
                    York Times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As part of the agreement, Microsoft is paying an undisclosed
                    sum of money to Semafor to sponsor a breaking news feed
                    called "Signals." The companies would not share financial
                    details, but the amount of money is "substantial" to
                    Semafor's business, said a person familiar with the matter.

                    [...] The partnerships come as media companies have become
                    increasingly concerned over generative AI and its potential
                    threat to their businesses. News publishers are grappling
                    with how to use AI to improve their work and stay ahead of
                    technology, while also fearing that they could lose traffic,
                    and therefore revenue, to AI chatbots—which can churn out
                    humanlike text and information in seconds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The New York Times in December filed a lawsuit against
                    Microsoft and OpenAI, alleging the tech companies have taken
                    a "free ride" on millions of its articles to build their
                    artificial intelligence chatbots, and seeking billions of
                    dollars in damages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Semafor, which is free to read, is funded by wealthy
                    individuals, including 3G capital founder Jorge Paulo Lemann
                    and KKR co-founder Henry Kravis. The company made more than
                    $10 million in revenue in 2023 and has more than 500,000
                    subscriptions to its free newsletters. Justin Smith said
                    Semafor was "very close to a profit" in the fourth quarter
                    of 2023.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at the world's biggest particle accelerator in
                    Switzerland have submitted proposals for a new, much larger,
                    supercollider. Its aim is to discover new particles that
                    would revolutionise physics and lead to a more complete
                    understanding of how the Universe works. If approved, it
                    will be three times larger than the current giant machine.
                    But its £12bn price tag has raised some eyebrows, with one
                    critic describing the expenditure as "reckless".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The biggest achievement of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
                    was the detection of a new particle called the Higgs Boson
                    in 2012. But since then its ambition to track down two holy
                    grails of physics - dark matter and dark energy - have
                    proved elusive and some researchers believe there are
                    cheaper options. The new machine is called the Future
                    Circular Collider (FCC). Cern's director general, Prof
                    Fabiola Gianotti, told BBC News that, if approved, it will
                    be a "beautiful machine".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The proposal is for the larger FCC to be built in two
                    stages. The first will begin operating in the mid 2040s and
                    will collide electrons together. It is hoped the increased
                    energy will produce large numbers of Higgs particles for
                    scientists to study in detail.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second phase will begin in the 2070s and require more
                    powerful magnets, so advanced that they have not yet been
                    invented. Instead of electrons, heavier protons will be used
                    in the search for brand new particles.

                  <p>
                    To that end, Paul Kempler, a chemical engineer at the
                    University of Oregon, and colleagues wondered whether an
                    industrial process for making chlorine from saltwater could
                    be repurposed for ironmaking. In this "chlor-alkali"
                    process, water containing sodium-chloride is placed in an
                    electrochemical cell resembling a battery that contains two
                    electrodes submerged in a liquid electrolyte. The positively
                    charged electrode, the anode, pulls electrons from chloride
                    ions, causing chlorine atoms to pair up into chlorine gas.
                    At the same time, electrons flowing in from the cathode
                    split water molecules into pieces that pair with the sodium
                    ions and one another to make sodium hydroxide and hydrogen
                    gas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To tweak the setup to purify iron, Kempler's team added iron
                    oxide particles to its cathode. Now, the electrons sent to
                    it would also release the oxygen atoms from iron oxide and
                    again form sodium hydroxide—as well as leave behind solid
                    metallic iron. The process is highly efficient, the
                    researchers claim. In fact, they estimate that selling the
                    chlorine and some of the sodium hydroxide at current market
                    prices should enable the overall process to produce iron at
                    roughly the same price as making it in blast furnaces. And
                    because sodium hydroxide can bind CO2 and convert it into
                    carbon-based minerals, the process could be used to help
                    capture CO2, making it carbon negative.

                    Starting September 1st, gas or hybrid SUVs, and other larger
                    vehicles weighing over 1.6 tonnes (1.76 tons), will be
                    charged €18 (around $19.40) per hour to park in the center
                    of Paris, and €12 (around $12.90) per hour in the rest of
                    the city. The new pricing also applies to electric vehicles
                    weighing over two tonnes (2.20 tons). Exemptions are in
                    place for taxis and city residents, which means those

                Over the past decade, one of the biggest stories in
                semiconductors has been a surprise eclipsing of traditional
                silicon—in the field of power electronics, where silicon carbide
                (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) have raced past silicon to
                capture multibilllion-dollar segments of the market. And as
                major applications fell to these upstarts, with their superior
                attributes, a question naturally arose. What would be the next
                new power semiconductor—the one whose superior capabilities
                would grab major market share from SiC and GaN?
              </p>
              <p>
                Attention has focused on three candidates: gallium oxide,
                diamond, and aluminum nitride (AlN). All of them have remarkable
                attributes, as well as fundamental weaknesses that have so far
                precluded commercial success. Now, however, AlN's prospects have
                improved enormously, thanks to several recent breakthroughs,
                including a technological advance at Nagoya University reported
                at the most recent IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting,
                held this past December in San Francisco.
              </p>
              <p>
                The IEDM paper describes the fabrication of a diode based on
                alloys of aluminum nitride capable of withstanding an electric
                field of 7.3 megavolts per centimeter—about twice as high as
                what's possible with silicon carbide or gallium nitride.
                Notably, the device also had very low resistance when conducting
                current. "This is a spectacular result," says IEEE Senior Member
                W. Alan Doolittle, a professor of electrical and computer
                engineering at Georgia Tech. "Particularly the on-resistance of
                this thing, which is ridiculously good." The Nagoya paper has
                seven coauthors, including IEEE Member Hiroshi Amano, who won a
                Nobel Prize in 2014 for his role in inventing the blue LED.
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] "This is a new concept in semiconductor devices," says
                Jena, of the Nagoya device. The next step, he adds, is
                fabricating a diode that has a layer of pure AlN at the
                junction, rather than 95 percent AlN. A layer of AlN just 2
                micrometers thick would suffice to block 3 kilovolts, according
                to his calculations. "This is exactly where this will go in the
                very near future," he says.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Georgia Tech, Doolittle agrees that there is still room for
                enormous improvement by incorporating higher levels of pure AlN
                in future devices. For example, the breakdown electric field of
                the Nagoya diode, 7.3 MV/cm, is impressive, but the theoretical
                maximum for an AlN device is about 15. Thermal conductivity,
                too, would be greatly improved with more AlN. The ability to
                conduct heat is vitally important for a power device, and the
                thermal conductivity of the AlGaN alloy is mediocre—below 50
                watts per meter-kelvin. Pure aluminum nitride, on the other
                hand, is very respectable at 320, in between GaN, at 250, and
                SiC, at 490.

                    to connect two satellites over 5,400 kilometers (3,355
                    miles) apart. The link was so long "it cut down through the
                    atmosphere, all the way down to 30 kilometers above the
                    surface of the Earth," he said, before the connection broke.

                    "Another really fun fact is that we held a link all the way

                    dissent without a meeting may authorize another person or
                    persons to act for such Director Member by proxy. Every
                    proxy must be in writing and signed by the Director Member
                    or the Director Member's duly authorized agent, or by email

                    determined that the proxy was authorized by such Director
                    Member. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of
                    eleven (11) months from the date thereof unless otherwise
                    provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable at the
                    pleasure of the Director Member executing it, except as
                    otherwise provided by law. For the purposes of conducting
                    meetings, all proxies shall be delivered to the Secretary of
                    the Corporation or, upon the absence of a Secretary, the
                    presiding Director Member appointed to act as secretary of
                    the meeting. Authorization for a proxy shall be valid only
                    for a singular meeting identified directly in the proxy
                    authorization. Each natural person shall only be able to
                    represent a single proxy vote per issue.

                    Section 3.07 Action without a Meeting. Action may be taken
                    without a meeting on written consent (which can be solicited
                    by the Corporation to all Director Members and returned by
                    the Director Members in electronic form, such as email)
                    setting forth the action to be taken, signed by such
                    Director Members as would be required to take the relevant
                    action at a meeting. Such consent may be written or
                    electronic. If consent is electronic it must be able to be
                    reasonably determined to have been sent by the Director
                    Member. In the event action is taken by written consent, the
                    Members not voting thereon shall be given prompt notice of
                    actions taken by written consent without a meeting. The
                    request of such consent shall be made publicly before the
                    request is made as a Meta posting on soylentnews.org or on
                    an earmarked journal entry from an account earmarked for
                    such publications. The results of such a request shall be
                    similarly published as a Meta posting on soylentnews.org or
                    on an earmarked journal entry from an account earmarked for
                    such publications.

                  <p>
                    Section 3.08 Community Members. As noted in Section 3.01,
                    Community Members shall have their own distinct voting
                    rights for substantive management, governance, or control
                    rights over the Corporation. The Board of Directors may
                    elect to call a meeting of the Community Members, in its
                    discretion, on such terms as it deems fit. The Board may
                    further seek the informal, non-binding guidance of the
                    Community Members in connection with any issue, topic, or
                    decision to be made, or may form a temporary or ongoing
                    advisory board with respect to an issue, topic, or decision
                    to be made, or to ensure an independent decision in the case
                    of a decision or transaction involving a conflict of
                    interest affecting one or more Board members. Formal voting
                    exercised by the Community Members under the provisions
                    provided for them in the bylaws, or in instances of voting
                    specifically requested by the Board Members, shall be
                    considered binding and the results of such a vote shall have
                    higher precedence and authority than any other voting class.
                  </p>
                  <p>ARTICLE IV</p>
                  <p>Community Members</p>
                  <p>
                    Section 4.01 Definition. The Community Members shall consist
                    of registered users of the SoylentNews.org website who
                    maintain an active account in good standing of the site
                    policy. Each unique natural person who qualify is entitled
                    to one vote as a Community Member. The Secretary shall be
                    responsible for overseeing the maintenance of such a record
                    of users and for determining who qualifies for eligibility
                    as a Community Member during voting by the community
                    members.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Section 4.02 Voting Procedures. The election of or
                    replacement for any Director Members shall be conducted by a
                    vote of the Community Members. Any natural person willing
                    and legally able shall be eligible for election. Elections
                    shall use proportional ranked choice voting using the Droop
                    quota for voting calculations. In cases of election or
                    positions being voted on, the community members shall be
                    given a period of one week before any voting to submit names
                    to be voted on. Community members shall be given a period of
                    voting of four weeks for any vote before them. A
                    super-majority of the board may vote to change an individual
                    case of the communities' voting period duration but may not
                    do so if the duration would be less than one-hundred and
                    sixty eight (168) hours. The total vote of the community
                    members shall be the number of votes cast by all eligible
                    Community Members for each vote. Voting for changes to the
                    bylaws may be accomplished by a simple vote requiring the
                    supermajority of the total vote of the Community Members.
                    All other voting shall require a simple majority of the
                    total vote as its quota. Changes to the bylaws may only be
                    made through a Community Member vote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Section 4.03 Vote Qualification. Community Members shall be
                    considered eligible for a vote if they qualify under the
                    definition of a Community Member as defined in Section 4.01
                    for a period of not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
                    start of the voting period. The topic of a vote may be
                    proposed by any Community Member. For such a proposal to be
                    considered by a vote of the community it must be either (a)
                    sponsored by any Director Member or (b) have the approval of
                    a minimum of 10% of the active users of the website in the
                    last weekly report as recorded by the SoylentNews platform.
                    Technical measures may be used to ensure the integrity of
                    the voting. The Secretary shall oversee that these criteria
                    and measures are used to maintain a list of valid voting
                    Community Members for each vote as appropriate.

                  <p>
                    Section 5.01 Board Powers and Number. The affairs and
                    property of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the
                    direction of the Board of Directors (the "Board"), subject
                    to applicable law and in accordance with the purposes and
                    limitations set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation
                    and herein. The number of voting directors shall be three
                    (3). The numbers of directors can be increased or decreased
                    from time to time, by resolution of the Board, but such
                    action by the Board shall require a vote of a majority of
                    the Entire Board and no decrease shall shorten the term of
                    any director then in office. As used in these by-laws, the
                    term "Entire Board" shall mean the total number of directors
                    entitled to vote which the Corporation would have if there
                    were no vacancies on the Board. The board shall consist of
                    three (3) Voting Director Members consisting of the
                    President, Secretary, and Treasurer.

                    Section 5.02 Election and Term of Office. The initial
                    directors shall be the persons named in the Certificate of
                    Incorporation and shall serve until the first Annual Meeting
                    of the Director Members. Thereafter, to become a director, a
                    person shall be nominated and elected by the community
                    members as detailed in Section 4.02 at a meeting of Director
                    Members for the purpose of the annual election of Directors.
                    Directors shall hold office for a term of one (1) years, and
                    each shall serve for such term and until the election and
                    qualification of a successor, or until such director's
                    death, resignation, or removal. Directors may be elected to
                    any number of consecutive terms.

                    be a natural person and shall be at least 18 years of age.
                    The Board may set such other qualifications for directors as
                    it deems necessary or appropriate, in its good faith
                    discretion. Any director must be a Director Member, and
                    should a director no longer be a Director Member (or vice
                    versa), he or she shall be immediately removed as a director
                    and shall no longer be a Director Member, receiving no
                    compensation for his or her membership interest.

                    Section 5.04 Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies.
                    Newly created directorships resulting from an increase in
                    the authorized number of directors, and vacancies occurring
                    for any reason, including any vacancy occurring by reason of
                    the death, resignation, or removal of a director, may be
                    filled by holding community election for the available
                    position(s) as specified in Section 4.02. Each director so
                    elected shall serve until the next Annual Meeting of the
                    Director Members or until such director's successor is
                    elected or appointed and qualified.

                    Section 5.05 Removal. Any director may be removed at any
                    time by a vote of a majority of Director Members (excluding
                    from the numerator and denominator the director(s) to be
                    removed). Removal by voting of the Community Members need
                    not to be with cause.

                    Board. Unless otherwise specified in the notice, the
                    resignation shall take effect at the time of receipt by the
                    Board or such officer. The acceptance of such resignation
                    shall not be necessary to make it effective. No resignations
                    shall discharge any accrued obligation or duty of a
                    director. As set forth above, resignation as a director
                    shall terminate the former director's Director Member
                    status.

                    appropriate.

                    fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by law, indemnify
                    any person made, or threatened to be made, a party to any
                    action or proceeding with any third-party by reason of the
                    fact that he or she, his or her testator or intestate, was a
                    director or officer of the Corporation, against judgments,
                    fines, amounts paid in settlement, and reasonable expenses,
                    including reasonable attorneys' fees. No indemnification may

                    determination of the Board (excluding the affected
                    director(s)), (a) his or her acts were committed in bad
                    faith or were the result of his or her willful misconduct or
                    active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to such
                    action or proceeding, or (b) he or she personally gained or
                    sought to gain a financial or other benefit or other
                    advantage or opportunity to which he or she was not entitled
                    in connection with his or her actions or inactions in
                    connection with service to the Corporation.

                  <p>
                    Section 9.02 Insurance. The Corporation shall have the
                    power, but not the obligation, to purchase and maintain
                    insurance to indemnify the Corporation for any obligation
                    which it incurs as a result of its indemnification of
                    directors and officers pursuant to Section 8.01 above, or to
                    indemnify such persons in instances in which they may be
                    indemnified pursuant to Section 8.01 above.

                    employees, or third parties, including agents, service
                    providers, consultants, tax advisors, and others. The Board
                    may approve a form of such contract including
                    indemnification (such as a form of employment agreement,
                    consulting agreement, etc.) with implementation and
                    execution of such agreements delegated to one or more

                  <p>INTERESTED PARTY TRANSACTIONS</p>
                  <p>
                    Section 10.01 Conflict of Interest Policy. The Board may
                    determine to adopt a Conflict of Interest Policy governing
                    situations where it faces a financial or other conflict or
                    seeks to engage in an interested party transaction. For
                    purposes of these by-laws, an "interested party transaction"
                    is any contract or other transaction between the Corporation
                    and (a) any present director or any individual who has
                    served as a director in the five (5) years preceding the
                    transaction ("past director"), (b) any family member of a
                    present or past director, (c) any corporation, partnership,
                    trust, or other entity in which a present or past director
                    is a director, officer, or holder of a financial interest,
                    (d) any present officer or any individual who has served as
                    an officer in the five (5) years preceding the transaction
                    ("past officer"), (e) any family member of a present or past
                    officer, or (f) any corporation, partnership, trust, or
                    other entity in which a present or past officer is a
                    director, officer, or holder of a financial interest. If
                    such a policy is adopted, in any instance where the
                    Corporation proposes to enter into an interested party
                    transaction, it shall follow the procedures and rules set
                    forth in the Corporation's Conflict of Interest Policy.

                    Section 10.02 Approval other than Pursuant to Conflict of
                    Interest Policy. If the Board does not or has not yet
                    developed a Conflict of Interest Policy, the Board may
                    approve an interested party transaction with the consent or
                    approval of a majority of the directors that are not
                    involved in the interested party transaction on a
                    determination that the transaction (a) is in the best
                    interests of the Corporation, (b) is fair to the Corporation
                    and reasonable in its terms, (c) is in alignment with or not
                    opposed to the Corporation's mission and charitable
                    objectives, and (d) does not create an appearance of
                    impropriety that might impair Member or public confidence
                    in, or the reputation of, the Corporation (even absent any
                    actual conflict or wrongdoing). The Board shall make a
                    written record of its decision-making process in connection
                    with an interested party transaction.

                    quorum is present, except a two-thirds vote of the Entire
                    Board shall be required for any amendment to add or remove a
                    provision of these by-laws requiring a greater proportion of
                    directors to constitute quorum or a greater proportion of
                    votes necessary for the transaction of business. Such action
                    is authorized only at a duly called and held meeting of the
                    Board for which written notice of such meeting, setting
                    forth the proposed alteration, is given in accordance with
                    the notice provisions for special meetings set forth herein.
                    If these by-laws are altered, amended, or repealed by the
                    Board, there shall be set forth in the notice of the next
                    meeting of members for the election of directors the by-laws
                    so adopted, amended, or repealed, together with a concise
                    statement of the changes made. Any such change under this
                    section shall still be required to meet the requirements of
                    Section 4.02 requiring a community vote to adopt such
                    changes.

                    historical environmental conditions requires meticulous

                    The scientists found that the percentage of total organic
                    carbon content of the samples increased through the study
                    period (3.8 million years), peaking at ~28 weight % at OAE2
                    from initial levels of 1–17 weight %. This occurred
                    alongside a ~5-8°C increase in sea surface temperature up to
                    ~43°C.

                  <p>
                    Key biomarkers of 28,30-dinorhopane and lycopane are
                    indicative of this warming and decline in oxygen, forming an
                    oxygen minimum zone in the Cenomanian, similar to those
                    observed in the Black Sea today. This data is coupled with a
                    noticeable reduction in the abundance of benthic
                    foraminifera (bottom ocean-dwelling single-celled
                    microorganisms) in the late Cenomanian, as they were not
                    able to survive in the depleted-oxygen environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such persistent low-oxygen layers increase in number and
                    size with enhanced warming of the oceans, forming a thick
                    zone at depth below a highly productive thin surface layer
                    that is oxygen-rich. Biomarkers of C<sub>35</sub> hopanoid
                    thiophene and isorenieratane reveal this water-column
                    euxinia (both anoxic and sulphidic) expanded to finally
                    reach the surface photic zone through the
                    Cenomanian-Turonian boundary at OAE2.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Looking ahead to the future of Earth's oceans with the
                    expansion of oxygen minimum zones, Dr. Abraham says, "In
                    today's world, oceanic conditions are generally hypoxic but
                    have not yet reached anoxic levels in open oceans. However,
                    closed basins or seas are more prone to becoming anoxic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "With ongoing global warming, it is predicted that oxygen
                    minimum zones will expand both horizontally and vertically.
                    Warmer water holds less oxygen, and increased surface
                    temperatures can lead to stronger stratification of ocean
                    layers, thereby reducing the mixing that normally
                    replenishes oxygen in deeper waters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Additionally, global warming can enhance biological
                    activity in surface waters, resulting in more organic matter
                    sinking to the depths, where it consumes oxygen as it
                    decomposes, a process evident during OAE2.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Today, oxygen minimum zones are primarily found in the
                    Pacific and Indian Oceans, with conditions making life hard
                    for many marine species. With the current trends of global
                    warming, these zones are expected to expand, reducing
                    habitable marine space and adversely affecting marine
                    biodiversity and fisheries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "By the end of this century, if the current trajectory of
                    warming and nutrient runoff continues, we might see a
                    significant increase in anoxic and euxinic conditions in our
                    oceans, threatening marine ecosystems and the services they
                    provide to humanity."

                    revealed a significant financial loss suffered by a
                    multinational company's Hong Kong office, amounting to
                    HK$200 million (US$25.6 million), due to a sophisticated
                    scam involving deepfake technology. The scam featured a

                    [...] The scam was initially uncovered following a phishing
                    attempt, when an employee in the finance department of the
                    company's Hong Kong branch received what seemed to be a
                    phishing message, purportedly from the company's UK-based
                    chief financial officer, instructing them to execute a
                    secret transaction. Despite initial doubts, the employee was
                    convinced by the presence of the CFO and others in a group
                    video call and proceeded to make 15 transfers totaling
                    HK$200 million to five different Hong Kong bank accounts.
                    The realization of the scam occurred approximately a week
                    later, prompting a police investigation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Acting senior superintendent Baron Chan Shun-ching of
                    the Hong Kong police emphasized the novelty of this scam,
                    noting that it was the first instance in Hong Kong where
                    victims were deceived in a multi-person video conference
                    setting. He pointed out the scammer's strategy of not
                    engaging directly with the victim beyond requesting a
                    self-introduction, which made the scam more convincing.

                  <p>The myth...</p>
                  <p>
                    When thinking about data backup, many people have tended to
                    fixate on the possibility of a crashed hard disk, and in
                    modern times, a totally dead SSD. It's been the classic
                    disaster scenario for decades, assuming that your office
                    doesn't burn down overnight. You sit down in front of your
                    desktop in the morning, and it won't boot. As you reach in
                    to fiddle with SATA cables and clean connections, you
                    realise that the disk isn't even spinning up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Maybe you knew enough to try a couple of short, sharp,
                    ninety degree twists in the plane of the platters, in case
                    it was caused by stiction. But sooner or later, reality
                    dawns, and it becomes clear that the disk will never spin
                    again. It, along with your data, is gone forever. So a
                    couple of full back-ups at regular intervals should suffice,
                    right?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Except that isn't how it usually happens - most likely
                    you'll be calling on your backups for some other reason.
                  </p>
                  <p>The reality...</p>
                  <p>
                    Aside from the fact that when modern SSDs fail they often
                    remain readable, I.E. they become read-only, your data is
                    much more likely to be at risk from silent corruption over
                    time or overwritten due to operator error.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Silent corruption can happen for reasons ranging from bad
                    SATA cables and buggy SSD firmware, to malware and more.
                    Operator error might go genuinely un-noticed, or be covered
                    up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Both of these scenarios can be protected against with an
                    adequate backup strategy, but the simple approach of a
                    regular, full backup, (which also often goes untested), in
                    many cases just won't suffice.
                  </p>

                Aspects like the time interval between backups, how many copies
                to have and how long to keep them, speed of recovery, and the
                confidentiality and integrity of said backups are all addressed.
                Also covered are silent corruption, archiving unchanging data,
                examples of comprehensive backup plans, and how to correctly
                store, label, and handle the backup storage media.

                discuss 'improvements' to web browser that are supposed to make
                our lives better in some way. This one is slightly different. It
                is, as far as I can recall, the first time that we have received
                a submission for a Windows Boot Disk.

                    have been updated.<br />- Most of the known bugs have been

                    "Hiren's BootCD PE (Preinstallation Environment) is a
                    restored edition of Hiren's BootCD based on Windows 11 PE
                    x64. Given the absence of official updates after November
                    2012, the PE version is currently under development by the
                    fans of Hiren's BootCD. It features a curated selection of
                    the best free tools while being tailored for new-age
                    computers, supporting UEFI booting and requiring a minimum
                    of 4 GB RAM.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Equipped with these invaluable tools, you can address
                    various computer-related problems. Notably, it does not
                    include any pirated software; instead, it exclusively
                    contains free and legal software.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If your computer does not support a regular Windows 11
                    installation, it will likely boot with the Windows 11 PE
                    version, as Windows PE versions have significantly lower
                    hardware requirements. For instance, if your computer boots
                    with the Windows 10 PE version, it is highly probable that
                    it will also boot with the Windows 11 PE version.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Upon booting, the PE version attempts to install drivers for
                    essential components such as graphics, sound, wireless and
                    Ethernet cards for your hardware, facilitating connection to
                    a WIFI or Ethernet network. If your WIFI or Ethernet card is
                    not recognized by the PE version, kindly Contact Us with

                    record and by terms of the plea deal that prevent him from

                    circumstances are still preferable to a period of
                    homelessness he experienced during his 20s. And while
                    console hacking might be out for Bowser, he is reportedly
                    still "tinkering away with old-school Texas Instruments
                    calculators" to pass the time.

                    Filion has been charged as an adult for a variety of

                    or furthering an act of terrorism. He is currently being

                The theoretical promise of AI is as hopeful as the promise of
                social media once was, and as dazzling as its most partisan

                really could transform scholarship and unearth lost knowledge.

                    Facebook (now Meta) has become an avatar of all that is
                    wrong with Silicon Valley. Its self-interested role in
                    spreading global disinformation is an ongoing crisis.
                    Recall, too, the company’s secret mood-manipulation
                    experiment in 2012, which deliberately tinkered with what
                    users saw in their News Feed in order to measure how
                    Facebook could influence people’s emotional states without
                    their knowledge. Or its participation in inciting genocide
                    in Myanmar in 2017. Or its use as a clubhouse for planning
                    and executing the January 6, 2021, insurrection. (In
                    Facebook’s early days, Zuckerberg listed “revolutions” among
                    his interests. This was around the time that he had a
                    business card printed with I’M CEO, BITCH.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And yet, to a remarkable degree, Facebook’s way of doing
                    business remains the norm for the tech industry as a whole,
                    even as other social platforms (TikTok) and technological
                    developments (artificial intelligence) eclipse Facebook in
                    cultural relevance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new technocrats claim to embrace Enlightenment values,
                    but in fact they are leading an antidemocratic, illiberal
                    movement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Shakespearean drama that unfolded late last year
                    at OpenAI underscores the extent to which the worst of
                    Facebook’s “move fast and break things” mentality has been
                    internalized and celebrated in Silicon Valley. OpenAI was
                    founded, in 2015, as a nonprofit dedicated to bringing
                    artificial general intelligence into the world in a way that
                    would serve the public good. Underlying its formation was
                    the belief that the technology was too powerful and too
                    dangerous to be developed with commercial motives alone.

                    that closing the lid before flushing could substantially

                      >in 2019</a

                    bioaerosol sensors in a shared lavatory for a week to
                    monitor the number and size of contaminant particles. They
                    concluded that flushing with the toilet lid down reduced
                    airborne droplets between 30 and 60 percent. But this
                    scenario also increased the diameter of the droplets and
                    bacteria concentration. Leaving the lid down also means the
                    airborne microdroplets are still detectable 16 minutes after
                    flushing, 11 minutes longer than if one flushed with the lid

                    [...] Perhaps the least surprising finding is that rigorous
                    cleaning with a toilet bowl brush and Lysol reduced the
                    contamination by 99.99 percent compared to cleaning with
                    just a brush. Therefore, "The most effective strategy for
                    reducing restroom cross-contamination associated with toilet
                    flushing include the addition of a disinfectant to the
                    toilet bowl before flushing and the use of
                    disinfectant/detergent dispensers in the toilet tank," the
                    authors concluded. They also recommend regularly
                    disinfecting all restroom surfaces after flushing or
                    cleaning with a toilet brush in health care facilities—which
                    often have a lot of immunocompromised people—and if someone
                    in your house has an active infection like norovirus.

                    That tape over your webcam may not be enough. Researchers at
                    the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have
                    highlighted imaging privacy threats enabled by ambient light

                    use. However, researchers have shown visual information can
                    be gathered via one of the common ambient light sensors
                    installed in many devices. These small sensors usually
                    aren’t shuttered or disabled by users and are typically
                    permission-free on a device level.

                    Ambient light sensors are categorized as low-risk by device
                    makers and can often be accessed directly by software (or
                    malware) without any permissions or privileges.
                    Nevertheless, previous studies have shown such a rudimentary
                    sensor can provide enough information to infer keystrokes on
                    a virtual keyboard and
                    <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2666620.2666622"
                      >steal a device PIN</a
                    >, about 80% of the time. The new research shows what an
                    ambient light sensor can do when combined with an active
                    light source component – namely the device' screen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For their experiments, the MIT researchers used a Samsung
                    Galaxy View 2. This rather old and large (17.3-inch)
                    consumer tablet has its ambient light sensor next to the
                    front-facing (selfie) camera, which is still a very common
                    configuration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The scientists explained that the ambient light sensor
                    reads the light emitted by the screen shining on a person’s
                    face and being partially blocked by the hand / screen
                    interaction. A whole lot of complicated math, aided by AI
                    and image processing technology, was used by the researchers
                    to deliver their results.

                    Launching rockets into space with atomic bombs is a crazy
                    idea that was thankfully discarded many decades ago. But as
                    Richard Corfield discovers, the potential of using the
                    energy from nuclear-powered engines to drive space travel is
                    back on NASA’s agenda
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1914 H G Wells published The World Set Free, a novel
                    based on the notion that radium might one day power
                    spaceships. Wells, who was familiar with the work of
                    physicists such as Ernest Rutherford, knew that radium could
                    produce heat and envisaged it being used to turn a turbine.
                    The book might have been a work of fiction, but The World
                    Set Free correctly foresaw the potential of what one might
                    call “atomic spaceships”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea of using nuclear energy for space travel took hold
                    in the 1950s when the public – having witnessed the horrors
                    of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – gradually became convinced of
                    the utility of nuclear power for peaceful purposes. Thanks
                    to programmes such as America’s Atoms for Peace, people
                    began to see that nuclear power could be used for energy and
                    transport. But perhaps the most radical application lay in
                    spaceflight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among the strongest proponents of nuclear-powered space
                    travel was the eminent mathematical physicist Freeman Dyson.
                    In 1958 he took a year’s sabbatical from the Institute of
                    Advanced Study in Princeton to work at General Atomics in
                    San Diego on a project code-named Orion. The brainchild of
                    Ted Taylor – a physicist who had worked on the Manhattan
                    atomic-bomb project at Las Alamos – Project Orion aimed to
                    build a 4000-tonne spaceship that would use 2600 nuclear
                    bombs to propel it into space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Despite Project Orion ending, the lure of nuclear
                    propulsion never really went away (see box “Nuclear space
                    travel: a brief history”) and is now enjoying something of a
                    resurgence. Rather than using atomic bombs, however, the
                    idea is to transfer the energy from a nuclear fission
                    reactor to a propellant fuel, which would be heated to
                    roughly 2500 K and ejected via a nozzle in a process called
                    “nuclear thermal propulsion” (NTP). Alternatively, the
                    fission energy could ionize a gas that would be fired out of
                    the back of the spacecraft – what’s known as “nuclear
                    electric propulsion” (NEP).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, is nuclear-powered space travel a realistic prospect
                    and, if so, which technology will win out? [...] A nuclear
                    spacecraft would instead use fission energy to heat a fuel
                    (figure 1) – most likely cryogenically stored liquid
                    hydrogen, which has a low molecular mass and high heat of
                    combustion. “Nuclear propulsion, either electric or thermal,
                    could extract more energy from a given mass of fuel than is
                    possible via combustion-based propulsion,” says Dale Thomas,
                    a former associate director at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight
                    Center, now at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thomas says that today’s most efficient chemical propulsion
                    systems can achieve a specific impulse of about 465 seconds.
                    NTP, in contrast, can have a specific impulse of almost 900
                    seconds due to the higher power density of nuclear
                    reactions. Combined with a much higher thrust-to-weight
                    ratio, NTP could get a rocket to Mars in just 500 days,
                    rather than 900.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The thrust-to-weight ratio is crucial because it determines
                    the spacecraft’s ability to accelerate, which is especially
                    critical during key mission phases, like escaping Earth’s
                    gravity or manoeuvring in deep space,” says Mauro Augelli,
                    head of launch systems at the UK Space Agency. “The specific
                    impulse, on the other hand, is a measure of how effectively
                    a rocket uses its propellant.”

                        Red Hat's post was a rich example of burying the lede
                        and a decisive moment for many who follow the tricky
                        balance of Red Hat's open source commitments and service
                        contract business. Here's what followed.

                        The Software Freedom Conservancy's Bradley M. Kuhn
                        weighed in last week with

                        Hat's business model "skirts" GPL violation but had only
                        twice previously violated the GPL in newsworthy ways,
                        Kuhn wrote. Withholding Complete Corresponding Source
                        (CCS) from the open web doesn't violate the GPL itself,
                        but by doing so, Red Hat makes it more difficult for
                        anyone to verify the company's GPL compliance.

                      <p>
                        Kuhn expressed sadness that "this long road has led the
                        FOSS community to such a disappointing place."

                        his Ansible and other software projects, says that Red
                        Hat's moves are intended to "destroy" Rocky, Alma, and
                        other RHEL derivatives and that after the "knife in the
                        back" of abandoning full CentOS Linux, the recent moves
                        "took that knife and twisted it, hard."

                on Thursday for leaking the US spy agency's most valuable

                    Joshua Schulte, 35, was found guilty in 2022 of espionage
                    and other charges in what the CIA called a "digital Pearl
                    Harbor" -- the largest data breach in the history of the
                    intelligence agency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] US District Judge Jesse Furman sentenced Schulte to 40
                    years in prison for espionage, computer hacking, contempt of
                    court, making false statements to the FBI and child
                    pornography.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Schulte worked for the CIA's elite hacking unit from 2012 to
                    2016 when he quietly took cyber tools used to break into
                    computer and technology systems, according to court
                    documents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After quitting his job, he sent them to WikiLeaks, which
                    began publishing the classified data in March 2017.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The leaked data included a collection of malware,
                    viruses, trojans, and "zero day" exploits that, once leaked
                    out, were available for use by foreign intelligence groups,
                    hackers and cyber extortionists around the world, they said.

                    earlier this year that an American Airlines flight
                    attendant, Estes Carter Thompson III, was arrested "for
                    allegedly surreptitiously recording or attempting to record
                    a minor female passenger using a lavatory aboard an
                    aircraft." A search of Thompson's iCloud revealed "four
                    additional instances" where Thompson allegedly recorded
                    other minors in the lavatory, as well as "over 50 images of
                    a 9-year-old unaccompanied minor" sleeping in her seat.
                    While police attempted to identify these victims, they also
                    "further alleged that hundreds of images of AI-generated
                    child pornography" were found on Thompson's phone.<br />[...]<br />The

                    attorney general, Alan Wilson, has said that AI technology
                    available today may test that ruling, especially if minors
                    continue to be harmed by fake AI child sex images spreading
                    online. In the meantime, federal laws such as obscenity

                    A medical treatment given to children in the UK may have led
                    to some developing Alzheimer’s disease decades later, new
                    research out Monday suggests. The study presents evidence
                    that at least five people contracted the neurodegenerative
                    disorder from having received human growth hormones
                    contaminated with rogue amyloid beta protein. The authors
                    point out that Alzheimer’s cannot be caught person-to-person
                    through conventional means, however, and this specific
                    infection risk no longer exists today.

                    Starting in the 1950s, scientists learned how to extract
                    human growth hormone (HGH) from the pituitary glands of
                    cadavers. Unfortunately, the method only provided minute
                    amounts of hormone at a time, which limited the supply of
                    HGH available for medical and research purposes. As a
                    result, its distribution was meticulously handled, and it
                    was typically only given to treat the most severe
                    growth-related conditions in children.

                  <p>
                    This remained the status quo for the next 30 years, with
                    more than 20,000 children worldwide having received this
                    form of cadaver-derived HGH. But in the mid-1980s, health
                    officials in the U.S. and elsewhere began to get

                    a rare but universally fatal neurodegenerative disease.
                    These cases were happening in much younger people than
                    typically seen with CJD, and it was soon discovered those
                    affected shared a history of past HGH treatment. Within
                    months of this discovery, the U.S. and other countries shut

                    [...] The paper details eight patients who visited the UCL’s
                    National Prion Clinic. Five of them appear to have developed
                    early onset Alzheimer’s, with a sixth having mild cognitive
                    impairment. But none of the patients seemed to have known
                    genetic mutations that cause Alzheimer’s to happen at a
                    younger age or other shared factors besides a past history
                    of HGH treatment.

                    Alzheimer’s is caused by the build-up of two misfolded
                    proteins in the brain, amyloid beta and tau, with amyloid
                    beta seen as the driving force of the two. The team’s past
                    research has found amyloid beta inside the brains of people
                    who died from HGH-caused Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, as well
                    as inside samples of preserved HGH. And in the lab, they’ve
                    been able to successfully cause mice to develop
                    Alzheimer’s-like illness after exposing them to these
                    contaminated samples.

                    Put all the pieces together, the study authors say, and it’s
                    enough to show that “Alzheimer’s disease should now be
                    recognized as a potentially transmissible disorder.”

                    [...] “It is important to stress that the circumstances
                    through which we believe these individuals tragically
                    developed Alzheimer’s are highly unusual, and to reinforce
                    that there is no risk that the disease can be spread between
                    individuals or in routine medical care,” said study author
                    Jonathan Schott, a UCL neurologist and chief medical officer
                    at Alzheimer’s Research UK, in a

                    from the university. “These findings do, however, provide
                    potentially valuable insights into disease mechanisms, and
                    pave the way for further research which we hope will further
                    our understanding of the causes of more typical, late onset
                    Alzheimer’s disease.”

                    A Consumer Reports analysis looks at who is sending
                    information about your online activity to Facebook
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By now most internet users know their online activity is
                    constantly tracked. No one should be shocked to see ads for
                    items they previously searched for, or to be asked if their
                    data can be shared with an unknown number of "partners."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But what is the scale of this surveillance? Judging from
                    data collected by Facebook and newly described in a unique
                    study by

                      >Consumer Reports (PDF)</a
                    >, it's massive, and examining the data may leave you with
                    more questions than answers.

                    Using a panel of 709 volunteers who shared archives of their
                    Facebook data, Consumer Reports found that a total of
                    186,892 companies sent data about them to the social
                    network. On average, each participant in the study had their
                    data sent to Facebook by 2,230 companies. That number varied
                    significantly, with some panelists' data listing over 7,000
                    companies providing their data. The Markup helped Consumer
                    Reports recruit participants for the study. Participants
                    downloaded an archive of the previous three years of their
                    data from their Facebook settings, then provided it to
                    Consumer Reports.

                    While Meta does provide transparency tools like the one that
                    enabled the study, Consumer Reports identified problems with
                    them, including that the identity of many data providers is
                    unclear from the names disclosed to users and that companies
                    that provide services to advertisers are often allowed to
                    ignore opt-out requests.

                    Sometimes, it's worth taking a moment to note the end of an
                    era, even when that ending might have happened a long time
                    ago. Today, Apple announced that it considers the mid-2012
                    13-inch MacBook Pro obsolete. It was the last MacBook Pro to
                    include an optical drive for playing CDs or DVDs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This means that any MacBook Pro with an optical drive is no
                    longer supported.<br />[...]<br />Apple stopped selling the
                    mid-2012 13-inch MacBook Pro
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/10/apple-quietly-kills-non-retina-macbook-pro-it-sold-for-four-years/"
                      >in October 2016</a
                    >
                    (it was available for a while as the company's budget option
                    in the Pro lineup), so anyone doing the math saw this
                    coming.<br />[...]<br />The exclusion of an optical drive in
                    subsequent MacBook Pro models was controversial, but it's
                    now clear that whether Apple was jumping the gun at that
                    point or not, optical drives have fallen away for most
                    users, and many Windows laptops no longer include them.<br />[...]<br />That's
                    a sign of just how irrelevant optical drives are for today's
                    users, but this seems like a good time to remember a bygone
                    era of physical media that wasn't so long ago. So farewell,
                    mid-2012 13-inch MacBook Pro—honestly, most of us didn't
                    miss you by this point.

                    The model tested last week was assembled in 2018 in the

                    The study, conducted in 2022 between April and October,
                    analyzed EEG data recorded on each of 92 participants
                    immediately before and after they undertook a 40-minute
                    walk. Half walked through Red Butte, the arboretum in the
                    foothills just east of the university, and half through the
                    nearby asphalt-laden medical campus.<br />...<br />"The
                    participants that had walked in nature showed an improvement
                    in their executive attention on that task, whereas the urban
                    walkers did not, so then we know it's something unique about
                    the environment that you're walking in," McDonnell said. "We
                    know exercise benefits executive attention as well, so we
                    want to make sure both groups have comparable amounts of

                    data as opposed to surveys and self-reporting, which do
                    yield helpful information but can be highly subjective.

                    Earth's only natural satellite has decreased by about 45m

                    That isn't a lot of shrinkage, but apparently enough to lead
                    to problems.

                And the analogy explanation. The moon is like a grape ... not
                cheese. Do you know what goes with cheese? Wine. That is made
                from grapes. See it all ties together.

                    But long-term, will Eben's vision for what makes Raspberry
                    Pi change? Will there be turnover and some of the people who
                    make the Pi a joy to use be gone?

                  <p>
                    Will the software side start leaning on subscriptions to

                    "Unpredictable" is an understatement for many who attempted
                    to acquire certain models of the computer during the supply

                    Doctorow gave a speech on the topic at last year's DEF CON
                    infosec conference, and his analysis is gaining traction on
                    all sides of the political and technological spectrum.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Doctorow suggested enshittification of services
                    happens due to the kind of management that such
                    mega-companies demand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Traditionally, CEOs progress in a large company by taking a
                    new idea and growing it into a valuable business unit. It
                    worked for Microsoft's Satya Nadella in developing cloud
                    platforms for Redmond, and Andy Jassy followed a similar
                    route to success with Amazon after pioneering AWS.
                    Meanwhile, Sundar Pichai oversaw the growth of ChromeOS
                    before taking leadership at Alphabet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Doctorow thinks that the same process might also harm
                    innovation. Uneasy lies the head that bears the crown, and
                    CEOs might be unwilling to promote major new innovations –
                    he cited the failure of social network Google+ as a classic
                    example.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the end it should be possible to reverse the
                    current trend and reintroduce a more competitive technology
                    industry environment that can spur innovation, spread the
                    wealth, and grow more efficient for users, employers, and
                    investors.

                    The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
                    (ICANN) has proposed creating a new top-level domain (TLD)
                    and never allowing it to be delegated in the global domain
                    name system (DNS) root.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The proposed TLD is .INTERNAL and, as the name implies, it's
                    intended for internal use only. The idea is that .INTERNAL
                    could take on the same role as the 192.168.x.x IPv4 bloc –
                    available for internal use but never plumbed into DNS or
                    other infrastructure that would enable it to be accessed
                    from the open internet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ICANN's Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC)
                    advised the development of such a TLD in 2020. It noted at
                    the time that "many enterprises and device vendors make ad
                    hoc use of TLDs that are not present in the root zone when
                    they intend the name for private use only. This usage is
                    uncoordinated and can cause harm to Internet users" – in
                    part by forcing DNS servers to handle, and reject, queries
                    for domains only used internally.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] ICANN's board still has to sign off the creation of
                    .INTERNAL. But if you want to get ahead of the pack, there's
                    nothing stopping you. Indeed, some outfits already use ad
                    hoc TLDs. Open source Wi-Fi firmware project WRT has used
                    .LAN, and networking vendor D-Link has employed .dlink.
                  </p>
                  <p>There's nothing stopping you doing likewise.</p>
                  <p>
                    But as ICANN's proposal for the idea noted: "Operators who
                    choose to use private namespaces of the kind proposed in
                    this document should understand the potential for that
                    decision to have corresponding costs, and that those costs
                    might well be avoided by choosing instead to use a
                    sub-domain of their own publicly registered domain name."

                    Great whites, the largest predatory sharks in the world with
                    the most fatal attacks on humans, are tough to imagine as
                    newborn babies. That is partially because no one has seen
                    one in the wild, it seems, until now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wildlife filmmaker Carlos Gauna and UC Riverside biology
                    doctoral student Phillip Sternes were scanning the waters
                    for sharks on July 9, 2023, near Santa Barbara on
                    California's central coast. That day, something exciting
                    appeared on the viewfinder of Gauna's drone camera. It was a
                    shark pup unlike any they'd ever seen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Great whites, referred to only as white sharks by
                    scientists, are gray on top and white on the bottom. But
                    this roughly 5-foot-long shark was pure white.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We enlarged the images, put them in slow motion, and
                    realized the white layer was being shed from the body as it
                    was swimming," Sternes said. "I believe it was a newborn
                    white shark shedding its embryonic layer."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These observations are documented in a new paper in the
                    Environmental Biology of Fishes journal. The paper also
                    details the significance of having seen a live newborn white
                    shark.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Where white sharks give birth is one of the holy
                    grails of shark science. No one has ever been able to
                    pinpoint where they are born, nor has anyone seen a newborn
                    baby shark alive," Gauna said. "There have been dead white
                    sharks found inside deceased pregnant mothers. But nothing
                    like this."

                    By clocking the speed of stars throughout the Milky Way
                    galaxy, MIT physicists have found that stars further out in
                    the galactic disk are traveling more slowly than expected
                    compared to stars that are closer to the galaxy's center.
                    The findings raise a surprising possibility: The Milky Way's
                    gravitational core may be lighter in mass, and contain less
                    dark matter, than previously thought.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new results are based on the team's analysis of data
                    taken by the Gaia and APOGEE instruments. Gaia is an
                    orbiting space telescope that tracks the precise location,
                    distance, and motion of more than 1 billion stars throughout
                    the Milky Way galaxy, while APOGEE is a ground-based survey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The physicists analyzed Gaia's measurements of more than
                    33,000 stars, including some of the farthest stars in the
                    galaxy, and determined each star's "circular velocity," or
                    how fast a star is circling in the galactic disk, given the
                    star's distance from the galaxy's center.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team translated the new rotation curve into a
                    distribution of dark matter that could explain the outer
                    stars' slow-down, and found the resulting map produced a
                    lighter galactic core than expected. That is, the center of
                    the Milky Way may be less dense, with less dark matter, than
                    scientists have thought.

                    the mistake was spotted. The recipient attempted to flee to
                    Malaysia but was stopped at an Australian airport carrying a
                    large amount of cash.

                  <p>
                    Industry studies show that 90 percent of spreadsheets
                    containing more than 150 rows have at least one major
                    mistake. This is understandable because spreadsheet errors
                    are easy to make but difficult to spot. My
                    <a href="https://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol25/iss1/34/"
                      >own research</a
                    >
                    has shown that inspecting the spreadsheet's code is the most
                    effective way of debugging them, but this approach still
                    only catches between 60 and 80 percent of all errors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To break the cycle of repeated spreadsheet errors,
                    there are several things organisations can do. First,
                    introducing standardization would help to minimize confusion
                    and mistakes. For example, this would mean consistent
                    formatting, naming conventions, and data structures across
                    spreadsheets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, improving training is crucial. Equipping users with
                    the knowledge and skills to build robust and accurate
                    spreadsheets could help them identify and avoid pitfalls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, fostering a culture of critical thinking toward
                    spreadsheets is vital. This would mean encouraging users to
                    continually question calculations, validate their data
                    sources, and double-check their work.

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                We are running very short of time for creating a new site. We
                have one member of staff who has already volunteered for a post
                on the Board; other staff are already busy with their existing
                roles. We are looking for an additional 2 community members who
                wish to serve on a temporary Board so that we can create a new
                company and purchase the data, domains and other assets from the
                current site. But perhaps I should explain a little further....
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board should, as a minimum, consist of 3 people, A Chairman,
                a Secretary and the site's Accountant. These people will be
                named at the creation of the new company and will each assume
                one of those formal roles. There are implications to this.
                Firstly, the company data is not publicised widely but we can
                make no guarantee that it will always remain hidden from public
                view, either by a change in US law or by, for example, the
                action of an hacker. Therefore, any volunteers must be prepared
                to waive his/her anonymity although as things stand it should
                never actually be compromised. Secondly, this is a temporary
                post. The latest draft of Bylaws is a very good starting point
                but it has become apparent that they are not perfect. There will
                be changes required to the Bylaws and, when they have been
                changed and accepted by the Community, all posts on the Board
                must be filled by people who have been elected by the community.
                You could, of course, stand for election at that time if you so
                wish.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, we are only looking at putting names to roles so that
                we can create a company. Your experience and skill level are not
                the most important aspects. We will employ an professional
                accountant to produce the annual formal account reporting and it
                will not simply be left to our own 'Accountant'. Rather, the
                role is one of providing checks and balances for any expenditure
                and the management of the site's accounting records.
              </p>
              <p>
                How long the 'temporary' role will last is not something that we
                can currently forecast. But I would estimate it to be weeks or
                months rather than a long term responsibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think any sensible person would agree that we cannot simply
                pass control of the site and finances to unknown people so we
                must limit applications from those who have held an account for
                at least 6 months and have contributed to the site. The staff
                will treat all applications as sensitive data and we will only
                refer to individuals by their user name in any discussions or at
                subsequent meetings. We will, of course, need to know your true
                identity and contact details for the creation of the new
                company.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a chance for us to move the site to a new start and to
                ensure that we can provide continuity of stories each day for
                everyone to enjoy. We will all be involved - Board, staff and
                community - in producing new policy documents that are a
                reasonable balance between discussions and freedom of speech. We
                are almost at our 10th birthday. Many people did not expect us
                to reach our 1st birthday. I would like to see the site looking
                forward to many more birthdays to come.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can only achieve this with your help. The are approximately
                250 unique accounts, excluding ACs, active on the site each week
                although not all commenting in stories. We are only looking for
                2 volunteers.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you wish to volunteer please send your email giving your
                username to admin@soylentnews.org with the word "volunteer" in
                the subject. All emails will be treated in the strictest
                confidence. Time is of the essence so please don't delay in
                contacting us should you wish to volunteer.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>UPDATE: 31 Jan 2004</b>: We have the volunteers that we need
                to create a new company, many thanks to them for stepping
                forward. However, if you feel that you have something to offer
                and you wish to volunteer also then please do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is still some preparatory work to be done but I am doing
                that as quickly as I am able within my current time limitations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another point worth noting which may, or may not, be related is
                that the number of active accounts has gone over the 300 mark
                for the first time in many months. There are probably many more
                who are lurking or posting solely as AC.

                Now that the poles are melting, and that seven of the world's
                ten biggest shipping companies have suspended transit through
                the Red Sea, and that deforestation is drying up the Panama

                    Increasingly, yes — and for a worrying reason. The Arctic is
                    warming four times faster than the global average. Since
                    1978 ice cover has shrunk by roughly 78,000 square
                    kilometres per year. In June 2023 a study in Nature
                    Communications, a journal, suggested that the Arctic's first
                    ice-free summer could come as soon as the 2040s, even if the
                    world significantly reduces its greenhouse-gas emissions. As
                    ice thins and cold-water shipping technology advances,
                    Arctic waters will become more easily navigable.

                  <p>
                    They are already getting busier, if from a low base. The
                    most popular shipping route in the Arctic is the nsr, which
                    is controlled by Russia. Trade volumes along the route
                    increased by 755% between 2014 and 2022. Russia wants
                    traffic to increase ten-fold from 2022 levels by 2035. In
                    October it announced a joint venture with DP World, an
                    Emirati logistics company, to develop Arctic container
                    shipping. That month NewNew Shipping Line, a Chinese firm,
                    completed its first round-trip on an Arctic route between
                    Shanghai and St Petersburg.

                  <p>
                    [...] The Arctic will struggle to rival established shipping
                    routes. Extreme seasonal weather limits its potential for
                    commercial shipping. But as the ice cover shrinks, its
                    waters will become busier — and Russia will make ever
                    greater use of them.

                    A nearly invisible dwarf galaxy is challenging the model of
                    dark matter. An international team of astronomers, led by
                    the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) in

                    Nube, which means "Cloud" in Spanish, was named by the
                    5-year-old daughter of one of the researchers, aptly
                    reflecting the galaxy's ghostly and diffuse appearance. Its
                    discovery is significant because its faint surface
                    brightness allowed it to remain undetected in previous sky
                    surveys, despite its considerable size.

                    large and yet faint, a ghostly apparition in the universe.

                    What sets it apart is its significant amount of dark matter,
                    an invisible substance that does not emit, absorb, or
                    reflect light, making it undetectable by traditional
                    telescopes.

                    Hertz, which has made a big push into electric vehicles in
                    recent years, has decided it's time to cut back. The company
                    will sell off a third of its electric fleet, totaling
                    roughly 20,000 vehicles, and use the money they bring to
                    purchase more gasoline powered vehicles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Electric vehicles have been hurting Hertz's financials,
                    executives have said, because, despite costing less to
                    maintain, they have higher damage-repair costs and, also,
                    higher depreciation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "[C]ollision and damage repairs on an EV can often run about
                    twice that associated with a comparable combustion engine
                    vehicle," Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr said in a recent analyst
                    call.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And EV price declines in the new car market have pushed down
                    the resale value of Hertz's used EV rental cars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For rental car companies like Hertz, which sell lots
                    of vehicles in the used car market, depreciation has a big
                    impact on their business, and is a major factor when
                    deciding which cars to have in their fleets.

                    The FTC declined to comment on whether the order also
                    applies to data purchases by intelligence agencies. In
                    defining "location data," the FTC order seems to carve out
                    exceptions for any data collected outside the US and used
                    for either "security purposes" or "national security
                    purposes conducted by federal agencies or other federal
                    entities."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NSA officials told Wyden that not only is the intelligence
                    agency purchasing data on Americans located in the US but
                    that it also bought Americans' Internet metadata.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In response to Wyden's letter to Haines, the Under
                    Secretary of Defense for Intelligence &amp; Security, Ronald
                    Moultrie, said that the Department of Defense (DoD) "adheres
                    to high standards of privacy and civil liberties
                    protections" when buying Americans' location data. He also
                    said that he was "not aware of any requirement in US law or
                    judicial opinion" forcing the DoD to "obtain a court order
                    in order to acquire, access, or use" commercially available
                    information that "is equally available for purchase to
                    foreign adversaries, US companies, and private persons as it
                    is to the US government."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In another response to Wyden, NSA leader General Paul
                    Nakasone told Wyden that the "NSA takes steps to minimize
                    the collection of US person information" and "continues to
                    acquire only the most useful data relevant to mission
                    requirements." That includes some commercially available
                    information on Americans "where one side of the
                    communications is a US Internet Protocol address and the
                    other is located abroad," data which Nakasone said is
                    "critical to protecting the US Defense Industrial Base" that
                    sustains military weapons systems.
