                    two AI music-generation companies for "copyright
                    infringement on an almost unimaginable scale", musicians and
                    fans took to the internet to voice their support. "Amazing.

                    [...] There is often a group of protesters outside the
                    offices of OpenAI in San Francisco, holding "Pause AI"
                    banners. This sentiment will only grow if AI is left
                    unregulated. It may be tempting for countries to treat AI
                    development as an arms race, to rush ahead irrespective of
                    the cost. But

                    thinks this is a bad idea. AI developers, and the people
                    regulating the nascent AI industry, must listen to the
                    growing AI backlash.

                    With a unanimous 5-0 vote, the FCC says it is moving forward
                    with plans that should make unlocking your mobile phone
                    easier than ever. According to
                    <a
                      href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-404092A1.pdf"
                      >a new FCC announcement</a
                    >, the agency say it will begin crafting new rules that will
                    require that wireless carriers unlock customers’ mobile
                    phones within 60<br />days of activation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At various times unlocking your phone was deemed downright
                    illegal under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
                    Things have eased some over the years; very often it’s now
                    possible to unlock your device and change carriers if your
                    phone is paid off and you’re no longer under contract.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the FCC noted that the current guidelines surrounding
                    unlocking are a mish mash of voluntary industry standards
                    and more stringent unlocking requirements usually affixed to
                    either merger conditions or the use of certain spectrum. The
                    new rules should create some uniformity, and the FCC is
                    contemplating whether they should even apply to users still
                    under contract with their wireless carrier.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    >, suggesting it won’t be that dramatic of a shift for the
                    industry. The industry already had to be dragged kicking and
                    screaming out of an era where it not only tried to lock down
                    devices, but tried to block consumer choice as it pertains
                    to apps, software and services (remember when Verizon

                    Chiseling away at the draconian DMCA as well as merger and
                    spectrum purchase conditions already did most of the heavy
                    lifting, and if the FCC’s rules are well crafted, they
                    should help finish the job.

                    Researchers have transformed guide RNAs, which direct
                    enzymes, into a smart RNA capable of controlling networks in
                    response to various signals. A research team consisting of
                    Professor Jongmin Kim and Ph.D. candidates Hansol Kang and
                    Dongwon Park from the Department of Life Sciences at POSTECH
                    has developed a multi-signal processing guide RNA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The CRISPR/Cas system, often referred to as "gene
                    scissors," is a technology capable of editing gene sequences
                    to add or delete biological functions. Central to this
                    technology, which is used in several fields such as treating
                    genetic diseases and genetically engineering crops, is a
                    guide RNA that directs the enzyme to edit the gene sequence
                    at a specific location.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While advances in RNA engineering have spurred research into
                    guide RNAs that respond to biological signals, achieving
                    precise control of networks of genes to respond to multiple
                    signals has remained challenging.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this study, the team combined the CRISPR/Cas system with
                    biocomputing to overcome these limitations. Biocomputing is
                    a technology that connects biological components like
                    electronic circuits to program cellular and organismal
                    activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers implemented a guide RNA gene circuit capable
                    of decision-making based on inputs, similar to a Boolean
                    logic gate, which is one of the fundamental representations
                    of input-output relationships in digitized signal
                    operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This study is significant because it integrates

                    networks, enabling the processing, integration, and response

                    role of guide RNAs in merely directing enzymes to specific

                    Professor Jongmin Kim of POSTECH stated, "The research could
                    enable the precise design of gene therapies based on
                    biological signals within complex genetic circuits involved
                    in disease. RNA molecular engineering allows for the
                    simplicity of software-based structure design which will
                    significantly advance the development of personalized
                    treatments for cancer, genetic disorders, metabolic
                    diseases, and more."

                    Tesla is warning users about a popular "charging hack" that
                    can allegedly result in shorter wait times at select
                    Supercharger stations. The trick, which has been circulating
                    within the Tesla community for at least a few years now,
                    involves wrapping a damp towel around a Supercharger handle
                    when charging. The idea is that the wet rag acts as a
                    cooling agent, tricking temperature sensors inside the
                    handle into thinking the system is running cooler than it
                    actually is.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some claim the hack can increase the charging rate,
                    especially on hot summer days, resulting in a faster charge
                    and less waiting around. Now, Tesla has issued official
                    guidance on the matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the official Tesla Charging account on X,
                    placing a wet cloth on a Supercharger handle does not
                    increase its charging rate. In does, however, interfere with
                    the system's temperature monitors and could lead to
                    overheating or damage. Tesla advises against the towel trick
                    to help ensure their systems can operate correctly.

                    Tesla's claim that the trick does not work, at least with
                    older V2 Supercharging systems. One Tesla user put a damp
                    cloth over the charging handle on a V2 Supercharger, which
                    increased the charging rate from 60 kilowatts to 95 kW on a
                    hot day. Another user plugged in at two percent stage of
                    charge and reached 147 kW before thermal throttling kicked
                    in at 34 percent and slowed the rate down to 58 kW. Applying
                    a wet rag reportedly drove the charging rate up to 119 kW.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    V3 and newer Superchargers utilize active cooling. According
                    to Inside EV, the towel trick does not really help at all on
                    these systems unless you are charging a Cybertruck.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tesla owners would probably be best served to take the
                    company's advice and not fool with the trick. Saving an
                    extra few minutes simply is not worth the risk of damaging
                    your vehicle or Tesla's equipment.

                    by Ireland's Central Statistics Office (CSO) highlights the
                    explosive growth of energy consumption in data centers. The
                    electricity required by data center operators increased by
                    20 percent between 2022 and 2023, and the total metered
                    energy consumption equaled 21 percent of Ireland's capacity
                    in 2023.

                  <p>
                    Data centers now exceed the energy needs of both urban and
                    rural households, which accounted for 18 percent and 10
                    percent of total metered electricity consumption,
                    respectively. In 2023, the CSO recorded a truly
                    unprecedented increase in power required by Ireland's data
                    centers, rising from 290 gigawatt hours in 2015 to 1,661
                    gigawatt hours, a staggering 473 percent increase.

                    centers, which could double in just a couple of years. By
                    2026, Ireland may be forced to reserve almost a third of its
                    entire energy supply (32 percent) for data center operators
                    alone.

                    to widespread blackouts and reliability issues. However,

                    Archaeological findings at the renowned Mesolithic site of
                    Star Carr in North Yorkshire suggest that hunter-gatherers
                    maintained an ordered living space by designating specific
                    ‘zones’ for various domestic activities.

                    looked at microscopic evidence from the use of stone tools
                    found inside three structures – potentially cone-like in
                    shape or domed – dating to over 11,000 years ago at the Star

                    They found that there was a range of activities that were
                    likely to have taken place inside the ‘home’, including
                    wood, bone, antler, plant, hide, meat, and fish-related
                    work. The researchers then plotted out spatial patterns for
                    these activities to pinpoint where within the dwelling these
                    activities might have occurred.

                    Dr Jess Bates, from the University of York’s Department of
                    Archaeology, said: “We found that there were distinct areas
                    for different types of activity, so the messy activity
                    involving butchery, for example, was done in what appears to
                    be a designated space, and separate to the ‘cleaner’ tasks
                    such as crafting bone and wooden objects, tools or jewelry.

                  <p>
                    “This was surprising as hunter-gatherers are known for being
                    very mobile, as they would have to travel out to find food,
                    and yet they have a very organized approach to creating not
                    just a house but a sense of home.

                    architecture. One of the structures found was believed to be
                    shaped like a cone and was constructed out of wood from
                    felled trees, as well as coverings possibly made from
                    plants, like reeds, or animal hides. There is still very
                    little known about why hunter-gatherers would build such
                    structures and continued to throughout the Mesolithic
                    period.

                    Dr. Bates said: “Not only do we now know that
                    hunter-gatherers were constructing these dwellings, but they
                    had a shared group understanding of how to organize tasks
                    within them.

                    “In modern society, we are very attached to our homes both
                    physically and emotionally, but in the deep past communities
                    were highly mobile so it is fascinating to see that despite
                    this there is still this concept of keeping an orderly home
                    space.

                    The Hubble Space Telescope zooms in on a dense ball of
                    millions of stars within a galaxy orbiting the Milky Way.
                    Its ancient origins raise big questions about how galaxies
                    form and grow, [known as ] Globular cluster NGC 2005
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is 162,000 light-years away, in the Large Magellanic
                    Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and visible in
                    the constellation Dorado
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This new image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows an
                    object with mysterious origins that's commonly seen in the
                    Milky Way: a globular cluster, a densely packed and
                    gravitationally bound group of tens of thousands or millions
                    of stars. However, NGC 2005 is actually located in the Large
                    Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a dwarf galaxy close to the Milky
                    Way, and can be easily seen at night from the Southern
                    Hemisphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Globular clusters are thought to be billions of years old.
                    About 150 are known to exist in the halo of the Milky Way.
                    They orbit its center in the opposite direction as most
                    other objects in our galaxy, providing evidence for a theory
                    that they were captured while the Milky Way was merging with
                    other galaxies, according to NASA. That's how astronomers
                    think galaxies evolve and grow. Another clue is that
                    globular clusters host some of the oldest stars in the
                    universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NGC 2005 is the perfect test case because it exists outside
                    the Milky Way but is close enough to be studied carefully.
                    It's about 750 light-years from the heart of the LMC, the
                    biggest of about 40 dwarf galaxies near the Milky Way. Many
                    of these dwarf galaxies are thought to orbit the Milky Way,
                    though recent data from the Gaia spacecraft suggest that
                    many of them may just be passing by.

                    Researchers from Japan have been working hard to keep their
                    cool—or at least—keep their nanodevices from overheating. By
                    adding a tiny coating of silicon dioxide to micro-sized
                    silicon structures, they were able to show a significant
                    increase in the rate of heat dissipated. This work may lead
                    to smaller and cheaper electronic devices that can pack in
                    more microcircuits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As consumer electronics become ever more compact, while
                    still boasting increased processing power, the need to
                    manage waste heat from microcircuits has grown to become a
                    major concern. Some scientific instruments and nanoscale
                    machines require careful consideration of how localized heat
                    will be shunted out of the device in order to prevent
                    damage. Some cooling occurs when heat is radiated away as
                    electromagnetic waves—similar to how the sun’s power reaches
                    the Earth through the vacuum of space. However, the rate of
                    energy transfer can be too slow to protect the performance
                    of sensitive and densely packed integrated electronic
                    circuits. For the next generation of devices to be
                    developed, novel approaches may need to be established to
                    address this issue of heat transmission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a study recently published in the journal
                    <em>Physical Review Letters</em>, researchers from the
                    Institute of Industrial Science at the University of Tokyo,
                    showed how the rate of radiative heat transfer can be
                    doubled between two micro-scale silicon plates separated by
                    a tiny gap. The key was using a coating of silicon dioxide
                    that created a coupling between the thermal vibrations of
                    the plate at the surface (called phonons) and the photons
                    (which make up the radiation).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “We were able to show both theoretically and experimentally
                    how electromagnetic waves were excited at the interface of
                    the oxide layer that enhanced the rate of heat transfer,”
                    lead author of the study, Saeko Tachikawa says. The small
                    size of the layers compared with the wavelengths of the
                    electromagnetic energy and its attachment to the silicon
                    plate, which carries the energy without loss, allowed the
                    device to surpass the normal limits of heat transfer, and
                    thus cool faster.

                    Because current microelectronics are already based on
                    silicon, the findings of this research could be easily
                    integrated into future generations of semiconductor devices.
                    “Our work provides insight into possible heat dissipation
                    management strategies in the semiconductor industry, along
                    with various other related fields such as nanotech
                    manufacturing,” says senior author, Masahiro Nomura. The
                    research also helps to establish a better fundamental
                    understanding of how heat transfer works at the nanoscale
                    level, since this is still an area of active research.

                    The repository included the private portion of the platform
                    key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was
                    protected by a four-character password, a decision that made
                    it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing
                    curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the
                    corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went
                    largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly
                    researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain
                    incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security
                    experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances
                    offered by Secure Boot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers soon discovered that the compromise of
                    the key was just the beginning of a much bigger supply-chain
                    breakdown that raises serious doubts about the integrity of
                    Secure Boot on more than 300 additional device models from
                    virtually all major device manufacturers. As is the case
                    with the platform key compromised in the 2022 GitHub leak,
                    an additional 21 platform keys contain the strings "DO NOT
                    SHIP" or "DO NOT TRUST."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] People who want to know if their Windows device uses
                    one of the test platform keys can run the following
                    powershell command:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &gt;
                    [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString((Get-SecureBootUEFI<br />PK).bytes)
                    -match "DO NOT TRUST|DO NOT SHIP"<br />True
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Linux users can detect one of the test certificates by
                    displaying the content of the PK variable:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    $ efi-readvar -v PK<br />Variable PK, length 862<br />PK:
                    List 0, type X509<br />Signature 0, size 834, owner
                    26dc4851-195f-4ae1-9a19-<br />fbf883bbb35e<br />Subject:<br />CN=DO
                    NOT TRUST - AMI Test PK<br />Issuer:<br />CN=DO NOT TRUST -
                    AMI Test PK
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There's little that users of an affected device can do other
                    than install a patch if one becomes available from the
                    manufacturer. In the meantime, it's worth remembering that
                    Secure Boot has a history of not living up to its promises.
                    The most recent reminder came late last year with the
                    disclosure of LogoFAIL, a constellation of image-parsing
                    vulnerabilities in UEFI libraries from just about every
                    device maker. By replacing the legitimate logo images with
                    identical-looking ones that have been specially crafted to
                    exploit these bugs, LogoFAIL makes it possible to execute
                    malicious code at the most sensitive stage of the boot
                    process, which is known as DXE, short for Driver Execution
                    Environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "My takeaway is 'yup, [manufacturers] still screw up Secure
                    Boot, this time due to lazy key management,' but it wasn't
                    obviously a change in how I see the world (secure boot being
                    a fig leaf security measure in many cases)," HD Moore, a
                    firmware security expert and CTO and co-founder at runZero,
                    said after reading the Binarly report. "The story is that
                    the whole UEFI supply chain is a hot mess and hasn't
                    improved much since 2016."

                    Vivalt doesn't view the dip in hours spent working as a
                    negative outcome of the experiment, either. On the contrary,
                    according to Vivalt. "People are doing more stuff, and if
                    the results say people value having more leisure time — that
                    this is what increases their well-being — that's positive."

                    In other words, the cash transfers gave recipients more
                    autonomy over how they spent their time, according to
                    Vivalt.

                  <p>
                    "It gives people the choice to make their own decisions
                    about what they want to do. In that sense, it necessarily
                    improves their well-being," she said.

                    Researchers expected that participants would ultimately earn
                    higher wages by taking on better-paid work, but that
                    scenario didn't pan out. "They thought that if you can
                    search longer for work because you have more of a cushion,
                    you can afford to wait for better jobs, or maybe you quit
                    bad jobs," Vivalt said. "But we don't find any effects on
                    the quality of employment whatsoever."

                    Cash transfer recipients experienced a 26% increase in the
                    number of hospitalizations in the last year, compared with
                    the average control recipient. The average recipient also
                    experienced a 10% increase in the probability of having
                    visited an emergency department in the last year.

                    But, of course, the space agency has also tempered
                    expectations until more is known. Non-biological processes
                    could have created the leopard splotches, such as mineral
                    deposits from past flows of water. In the announcement, the
                    agency included the helpful graphic below, showing the
                    Confidence of Life Detection scale, or CoLD. With this
                    detection, NASA is at number one.

                    And, crucially, to move up the scale, the sample (from a
                    rock named Cheyava Falls) must be closely analyzed in labs
                    on Earth, with far more instruments than the distant,
                    car-sized rover can carry. This can prove if non-biological
                    factors actually formed the structures, confirm the presence
                    of past life, rule out other hypotheses, and beyond. NASA's

                    mission, however, is in jeopardy. It would cost around $11

                    agency can't afford. The agency now seeks a financially
                    feasible plan for the complex endeavor, which would retrieve
                    samples and rocket them back to Earth.

                    In a ferroelectric material, positive and negative charges
                    spontaneously head to different sides, or poles. Upon the
                    application of an external electric field, those charges
                    switch sides, reversing the polarization. Switching the
                    polarization can be used to encode digital information, and
                    that information will be nonvolatile, or stable over time.
                    It won’t change unless an electric field is applied. For a
                    ferroelectric to have broad application to electronics, all
                    of this needs to happen at room temperature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new ferroelectric material <a
                      href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/physicists-engineer-ferroelectricity-in-boron-nitride-0915"
                      >reported in <em>Science</em> in 2021</a
                    >
                    is based on atomically thin sheets of boron nitride that are
                    stacked parallel to each other, a configuration that doesn’t
                    exist in nature. In bulk boron nitride, the individual
                    layers of boron nitride are instead rotated by 180 degrees.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It turns out that when an electric field is applied to this
                    parallel stacked configuration, one layer of the new boron
                    nitride material slides over the other, slightly changing
                    the positions of the boron and nitrogen atoms. For example,
                    imagine that each of your hands is composed of only one
                    layer of cells. The new phenomenon is akin to pressing your
                    hands together then slightly shifting one above the other.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “So the miracle is that by sliding the two layers a few
                    angstroms, you end up with radically different electronics,”
                    says Ashoori. The diameter of an atom is about 1 angstrom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another miracle: “nothing wears out in the sliding,” Ashoori
                    continues. That’s why the new transistor could be switched
                    100 billion times without degrading. Compare that to the
                    memory in a flash drive made with conventional materials.
                    “Each time you write and erase a flash memory, you get some
                    degradation,” says Ashoori. “Over time, it wears out, which
                    means that you have to use some very sophisticated methods
                    for distributing where you’re reading and writing on the
                    chip.” The new material could make those steps obsolete.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yasuda, the co-first author of the current
                    <em>Science</em> paper, applauds the collaborations involved
                    in the work. Among them, “we [Jarillo-Herrero’s team] made
                    the material and, together with Ray [Ashoori] and [co-first
                    author] Evan [Zalys-Geller], we measured its characteristics
                    in detail. That was very exciting.” Says Ashoori, “many of
                    the techniques in my lab just naturally applied to work that
                    was going on in the lab next door. It’s been a lot of fun.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ashoori notes that “there’s a lot of interesting physics
                    behind this” that could be explored. For example, “if you
                    think about the two layers sliding past each other, where
                    does that sliding start?” In addition, says Yasuda, could
                    the ferroelectricity be triggered with something other than
                    electricity, like an optical pulse? And is there a
                    fundamental limit to the amount of switches the material can
                    make?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Challenges remain. For example, the current way of producing
                    the new ferroelectrics is difficult and not conducive to
                    mass manufacturing. “We made a single transistor as a
                    demonstration. If people could grow these materials on the
                    wafer scale, we could create many, many more,” says Yasuda.
                    He notes that different groups are already working to that
                    end.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Concludes Ashoori, “There are a few problems. But if you
                    solve them, this material fits in so many ways into
                    potential future electronics. It’s very exciting.”

                    On Monday, it initially seemed like the beginning of the end
                    for Intel's desktop CPU instability woes — the company
                    confirmed a patch is coming in mid-August that should
                    address the "root cause" of exposure to elevated voltage.
                    But if your 13th or 14th Gen Intel Core processor is already
                    crashing, that patch apparently won't fix it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Citing unnamed sources, Tom's Hardware reports that any
                    degradation of the processor is irreversible, and an Intel
                    spokesperson did not deny that when we asked. Intel is
                    "confident" the patch will keep it from happening in the
                    first place. (As another preventative measure, you should
                    update your motherboard BIOS ASAP.) But if your defective
                    CPU has been damaged, your best option is to replace it
                    instead of tweaking BIOS settings to try and alleviate the
                    problems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And, Intel confirms, too-high voltages aren't the only
                    reason some of these chips are failing. Intel spokesperson
                    Thomas Hannaford confirms it's a primary cause, but the
                    company is still investigating. Intel community manager Lex
                    Hoyos also revealed some instability reports can be traced
                    back to an oxidization manufacturing issue that was fixed at
                    an unspecified date last year.

                    commented about being upset. More searching found more
                    people upset including a few saying that it should be
                    "illegal" and penalties need to exist for doing something
                    like this. I did a little more searching and found that at
                    some point, it was something done on TikTok by someone and
                    it got a following. I then found an online version like
                    those other online versions of Bibles. The original post I
                    saw had a screenshot of a page, which I figured was just a
                    prop or photoshopped but it turns out, someone has used
                    ChatGPT to do a Gen-Z slang translation that can be
                    purchased in physical form. Evidently, some people are
                    buying them and taking them to church. In some discussion, I
                    saw people saying that this might be a way to reach some
                    younger people, as a positive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Anyway... I think it's pretty hilarious. I'm sure a bunch of
                    folks will be gasping and clutching pearls. I figured I'd
                    make a post as a PSA in case others haven't heard about it
                    before (like me).

                  <p>
                    Recently, my father and I took a trip out to a local
                    provincial park for a weekend of camping.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last time I had been camping happened to coincide with the
                    period of time that I was starting to gain curiosity about
                    amateur radio. I vividly recall being out there wishing I
                    had a radio that I could use to communicate from the
                    campsite.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, to appease my past self, the present-tense
                    radio-license-having version of me took my HF rig along to
                    make some contacts.

                    Justice Michael Lee handed down his judgement in the class
                    action against widely-used herbicide Roundup on Thursday
                    afternoon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The case, launched by Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, claims
                    Roundup's active ingredient glyphosate caused the cancer of
                    more than 800 Australian non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Justice Lee ruled there is not enough current evidence to
                    say glyphosate is carcinogenic and capable of causing
                    non-Hodgkin lymphoma in humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The judge only needed to consider the question of general
                    causation – not the specific claims of lead applicant Kelvin
                    McNickle or the other class action group members.
                  </p>
                  <p>Justice Lee ordered the proceedings be dismissed.</p>
                  <p>
                    Bayer, which acquired Roundup's producer Monsanto in 2018,
                    has previously stated glyphosate-based herbicides have been
                    rigorously tested in hundreds of studies and it is safe when
                    used as directed.

                    In addition, comparisons of the planet’s temperature map
                    with complex 3D atmospheric models demonstrated that this
                    temperature contrast is stronger than expected for a
                    cloud-free atmosphere. This suggests that the planet’s
                    nightside is shrouded in a thick layer of clouds that blocks
                    much of the infrared radiation that would otherwise be
                    observed. Unlike Earth’s water clouds, the clouds on this
                    extremely hot planet resemble dust and are composed of rocks
                    and minerals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Surprisingly, despite this thick layer of clouds, the
                    JTEC-ERS team also detected clear signals of water on the
                    planet’s nightside. This allowed them to determine, for the
                    first time, the cloud height and thickness, unveiling their
                    unusual altitude and density compared to Earth’s clouds. The
                    researchers also detected wind-driven mixing, called
                    “chemical disequilibrium,” that swiftly transports gas
                    throughout the planet’s atmosphere and results in uniform
                    atmospheric chemistry.

                    post 32 in row 13 came shooting out. Just like a bullet, it
                    went through the narrow part of the converging nozzle and
                    flew out into the nozzle extension."

                    This could have been disastrous – the LOX post had been

                    the bullet-shaped LOX pin hit the side of the right nozzle
                    extension.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The immediate effect was a hydrogen leak from the nozzle. It
                    was not huge, but enough for the engine's controller to
                    increase the oxidizer flow, increasing the turbine
                    temperature approximately halfway to the point where an
                    engine would be automatically shut down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It took the booster officer and his team around a minute to
                    realize something was amiss with the engine – not for want
                    of attention but because they had their hands full with
                    another problem. Remember that loose SRB connection? It
                    resulted in an alarm on the console. There were two
                    hydraulic systems on each SRB. If both failed, the SRB would
                    not be steerable. Another sudden CRIT 1 failure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And then there was that chafed wire and the potential short
                    circuit. As the Shuttle lifted off, the commander, Eileen
                    Collins, called "Fuel Cell PH."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hale wrote that the call indicated that one of the fuel
                    cells might be failing: "It's the Kaboom Case, Flight."
                    However, although the master alarm onboard Columbia was
                    wailing, the fuel cell had not actually failed. Instead, one
                    of the AC buses had shorted out. The affected part of the
                    circuit had been automatically shut down, and the erroneous
                    alarm was caused by suddenly unpowered instrumentation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One effect of the short was a loss of power to the Space
                    Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) controllers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Hale: "The A computer on the Center SSME lost
                    power, never to be recovered. The B computer (DCU B)
                    immediately took control and the engine ran on normally."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Except it wasn't running normally. The A channel pressure
                    transducer dropped offline, meaning that the B computer only
                    had the B transducer, which was reading slightly high – in
                    this case, 12 psi high. Automatically, the B computer
                    throttled back the center engine. Not hugely, but enough to
                    partially offset the shortfall of LOX caused by the nozzle
                    leak on the right engine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The engine had lost its B computer, but the A computer
                    continued working, and the engine, with the leak, carried on
                    running.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "How lucky we were," Hale said. "Instead of being 200 or
                    more fps short at MECO, possibly leading to an abort landing
                    or requiring two tons of OMS propellant to make up, we wound
                    up being only 15 fps short, well within the capability of
                    the OMS budget."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The mission itself was successful, and the Chandra X-ray
                    observatory, which is

                    service the Hubble Space Telescope.

                    that the wiring problem was likely caused by workers
                    "inadvertently stepping on it," and the problem had likely
                    been there since Columbia was manufactured. And the pin?
                    Apparently, it had never passed any acceptance testing.
                    STS-93 was the last flight of that generation of SSMEs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The next upgrade to the SSMEs was to build a more robust
                    channel wall nozzle extension," Hale said. "The shuttle
                    program ended before that was done."

                    Summing ASCII Encoded Integers on Haswell at the Speed of
                    memcpy turned out more popular than I expected, which
                    inspired me to take on another challenge on HighLoad:
                    Counting uint8s. I'm currently only #13 on the leaderboard,
                    ~7% behind #1, but I already learned some interesting
                    things. In this post I'll describe my complete solution
                    (skip to that) including a surprising memory read pattern
                    that achieves up to ~30% higher transfer rates on fully
                    memory bound, single core workloads compared to naive
                    sequential access, while apparently not being widely known
                    (skip to that).

                    The automaker announced the pivot in an earnings call this
                    week, with CEO Mary Barra citing the Origin's "unique
                    design" as creating too much "regulatory uncertainty." That
                    design was indeed unusual, with no immediately obvious front
                    or rear, and not a single spot for a human driver.

                    Instead of the Origin, GM's Cruise autonomous driving
                    division will refocus on modifying existing Chevy Bolt EVs
                    for self-driving capabilities. A new generation of
                    autonomous Bolts is slated for production in 2025, and Barra
                    says going this route will reduce costs per vehicle.

                    GM's chief financial officer Paul Jacobson says the company
                    "might" revisit Origin down the road, but currently the
                    efforts are "really going to be focused" on the Bolt.

                    CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm that crashed millions of
                    computers with a botched update all over the world last
                    week, is offering its partners a $10 Uber Eats gift card as
                    an apology, according to several people who say they
                    received the gift card, as well as a source who also
                    received one.

                    On Tuesday, a source told TechCrunch that they received an
                    email from CrowdStrike offering them the gift card because
                    the company recognizes "the additional work that the July 19
                    incident has caused."

                    A team of marine biologists and ecotoxicologists affiliated
                    with several institutions in Brazil has found cocaine in
                    muscle and liver samples collected from Brazilian Sharpnose
                    sharks harvested off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. Their
                    study,

                      href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969724049477"
                      >published</a
                    >
                    in the journal <i>Science of the Total Environment</i>,
                    highlights the potential impact of the presence of illicit
                    drugs in marine environments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prior research has suggested that much cocaine winds up in
                    the ocean via wastewater from sewage systems, drainage from
                    labs and packages abandoned by traffickers attempting to
                    prevent discovery. What is not known is how long the drug
                    persists in the sea and what impact it has on ocean life.
                    For this new study, the research team tested Brazilian
                    Sharpnose sharks, a small variety that makes its home in the
                    shallow waters along many of Brazil's coastal areas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers purchased 13 of the sharks from local
                    fishermen. Each was dissected in the lab, where the team
                    also collected muscle and liver samples and assessed them
                    with tandem mass spectrometry. They found cocaine in all the
                    samples at concentrations approximately 100 times higher
                    than observed in any other marine animal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers suggest their findings are just a starting
                    point regarding research into the presence of cocaine in the
                    sea. They note that it is not known what sort of impact the
                    cocaine might have on the sharks. They do not know, for
                    example, if it impacts their behavior, as it does humans, or
                    if it impacts other functions such as their reproductive
                    abilities.

                    A separate "front line" in this confrontation is the
                    development and implementation of SoM [System on Module]
                    with Programmable Logic. This post is dedicated to one small
                    "battle," on the example of which we want to show why, in
                    our opinion, China could win this "war."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since the announcement in 2019 by Xilinx (which then bore
                    this name without a proud three-letter prefix), Versal ACAP
                    (Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform) chips were
                    inaccessible to developers—the first development boards cost
                    tens of thousands of U.S. dollars, and the difficulty of
                    developing your own board for this chip would scare off
                    anyone other than Tony Stark.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A lot of water flowed, and a lot of developers' tears were
                    shed, but a silicon Versal is just as unavailable as The
                    Palace of Versailles: the cheapest kit from AMD–VEK280 is
                    sold by the official suppliers for $7K, excluding delivery
                    and customs clearance. The classic argument in the style of
                    "if you don't have money for an iron door, you don't need
                    it" does not always work in the field of R&amp;D—a rare
                    developer will refuse to study a top-end chip at the expense
                    of his employer, but even with this approach, the cost is
                    too high.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The problem is that the announcement of AMD Xilinx has
                    so far remained an announcement, but the developers from
                    Alinx, the Chinese company, did not waste any time. This
                    company already is known for its inexpensive development
                    boards with Zynq‑7000 and Ultrascale+ on board, not much
                    different from SoM. Now they not only promised, but also
                    mass-produced the SoM V100 with the XCVE2302-SFVA784-1LP-E-S
                    chip (Versal AI Edge family) for $750 [1].
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There is, of course, a fly in the V100 ointment. The
                    developers from Alinx were so inspired by Kria that they
                    also used "legendary" Samtec connectors "well-liked" by all
                    designers and engineers. Who among us hasn't drilled them
                    from the side with the thinnest drill, forgetting to route
                    that very necessary pin right in the middle in the inner
                    row? However, to achieve the required transmission speeds
                    with a compact size, there is hardly an alternative to
                    Samtec connectors.

                    A NASA infrared detector already confirmed in 2020 the
                    existence of water on the moon, while scientists found
                    traces of water in recent analyses of samples dating from
                    the 1960s and 1970s.

                  <p>
                    But the Chang'e-5 samples are from a "much higher latitude",
                    providing new clues as to what form water takes on the
                    moon's surface, the Chinese scientists wrote.

                  <p>
                    The samples suggest that "water molecules can persist in
                    sunlit areas of the moon in the form of hydrated salts",
                    they said.

                    Recently one of my older post about strlcpy has sparked some
                    discussion on various forums. Presumably the recently
                    released POSIX edition had something to do with it. One
                    particular counter-argument was raised by multiple posters -
                    and it's an argument that I've heard before as well:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        In the common case where the source string fits in to
                        the destination buffer, strlcpy would only traverse the
                        string once whereas strlen + memcpy would traverse it
                        twice always.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Hidden in this argument is the assumption that traversing
                    the string once is faster. Which - to be clear - is not at
                    all an unreasonable assumption. But is it actually true?
                    That's the focus of today's article.

                    When it comes to discoveries about our upper atmosphere, it
                    pays to know your surroundings.

                    Using data from the Twin Rockets to Investigate Cusp
                    Electrodynamics (TRICE-2) rocket launch, NASA scientists
                    Francesca Di Mare and Gregory Howes from the University of
                    Iowa studied waves traveling down Earth's magnetic field
                    lines into the polar atmosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These waves were known to accelerate electrons, which pick
                    up speed as they "surf" along the electric field of the
                    wave. But their effect on ions—a more heterogenous group of
                    positively charged particles, which exist alongside
                    electrons—was unknown.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By estimating the ion mixture they were flying
                    through—predominantly protons and singly charged oxygen
                    ions—the scientists discovered that these waves were
                    accelerating protons as they circle about the Earth's
                    magnetic field lines as well as electrons as they surf the
                    waves. The

                    This correspondence between human and chimpanzee
                    face-to-face communication points to shared underlying rules
                    in communication, the researchers say. They note that these
                    structures could trace back to shared ancestral mechanisms.
                    It's also possible that chimpanzees and humans arrived at
                    similar strategies to enhance coordinated interactions and
                    manage competition for communicative "space." The findings
                    suggest that human communication may not be as unique as one
                    might think.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It shows that other social species don't need language to
                    engage in close-range communicative exchanges with quick
                    response time," Badihi says. "Human conversations may share
                    similar evolutionary history or trajectories to the
                    communication systems of other species suggesting that this
                    type of communication is not unique to humans but more
                    widespread in social animals."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We still don't know when these conversational
                    structures evolved, or why!" Hobaiter says. "To get at that
                    question we need to explore communication in more distantly
                    related species -- so that we can work out if these are an
                    ape-characteristic, or ones that we share with other highly
                    social species, such as elephants or ravens."

                    Because MySQL is so popular, there are plenty of videos and
                    tutorials available to learn how to set up the database and
                    use its SQL syntax to create queries. MySQL is also suitable
                    for personal projects and is free for individual use. It
                    runs on both Windows and Linux, making it accessible to
                    almost any developer. Many developers begin learning
                    database programming and storage design with MySQL.

                    MariaDB is slightly more challenging because it's designed
                    as an enterprise solution. It has more engines to work with
                    and is available in the cloud. Most enterprise applications

                    No one can predict the future, but MySQL is likely here to
                    stay. More application developers might choose MariaDB over
                    MySQL for enterprise applications, but MySQL still maintains
                    a strong market presence. WordPress works natively with
                    MySQL and powers a significant percentage of websites –
                    however, WordPress is also compatible with MariaDB – MariaDB
                    can be used seamlessly with WordPress without requiring
                    significant changes.

                  <p>
                    In the future, MariaDB could power a large portion of web
                    applications, but for now, it maintains a strong presence in
                    the enterprise realm, especially in Linux environments. It's
                    possible that MariaDB will become a more popular database
                    for enterprise applications in a LAMP environment.

                    If you need to learn about databases or have a small pet
                    project, MySQL may be the best option. MySQL offers a
                    convenient desktop application that simplifies database
                    management and configuration. The
                    <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/"

                    software uses a graphical user interface to guide you
                    through the table creation process, and you can build your
                    queries and functions with better feedback from the database
                    service if you make mistakes.

                    In a large organization, MariaDB is the better option. It's
                    also beneficial for smaller businesses that expect a large
                    increase in concurrent users (there are some
                    <a
                      href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/graphical-and-enhanced-clients/"
                      >GUI applications here</a
                    >, too, if you need them). MariaDB scales easily as an
                    application becomes more popular and more users access it.
                    If you want to get experience working with cloud databases,
                    MariaDB is a good choice for learning replication and
                    management of data in the cloud.

                  <p>
                    As a fork of MySQL, MariaDB shares many similarities with
                    its predecessor, making the determination of "which is
                    better" subjective. Some developers prefer MariaDB because
                    it's open-source and free, but MySQL is a stable, popular
                    alternative that's good for small projects.

                    (DHS) has announced that it has developed a four-legged
                    robot designed to jam the wireless transmissions of smart
                    home devices. The robot was revealed at the 2024 Border
                    Security Expo and is called NEO. It is built using the
                    Quadruped Unmanned Ground Vehicle (Q-UGV) and looks a lot
                    like the Boston Dynamics Spot robot. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the transcript of the speech by DHS Federal Law
                    Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) director Benjamine
                    Huffman, acquired by
                    <a
                      href="https://www.404media.co/dhs-has-a-ddos-robot-to-disable-internet-of-things-booby-traps-inside-homes/"
                      >404 Media</a
                    >, NEO is equipped with an antenna array that is designed to
                    overload home networks, thus disrupting devices that rely on
                    Wi-Fi and other wireless communication protocols. It will
                    thus likely be effective against a wide range of popular
                    smart home devices that use wireless technologies for
                    communications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Aside from taking out smart devices, law enforcement can
                    also use the robot to communicate with subjects in the
                    target area, and to provide remote eyes and ears to officers
                    on the ground. “NEO can enter a potentially dangerous
                    environment to provide video and
                    <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/audio">audio</a>
                    feedback to the officers before entry and allow them to
                    communicate with those in that environment,” says Huffman.
                    “NEO carries an onboard computer and antenna array that will
                    allow officers the ability to create a ‘denial-of-service’
                    (DoS) event to disable ‘Internet of Things’ devices that
                    could potentially cause harm while entry is made.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This roaming robotic jammer was first contemplated after a
                    child sexual abuse suspect used his doorbell camera to see
                    FBI agents at his door serving a search warrant. The gunman
                    opened fire on them from behind the closed door with an
                    assault-style rifle, killing two veteran agents and injuring
                    three more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Aside from the NEO, the DHS also built the ‘FLETC Smart
                    House’, which is designed to train law enforcement about
                    smart home devices and how they could be used against them.
                    Huffman explained, “A suspect who has been searched and is
                    under the control of officers can cause these actions to
                    happen with a simple voice command which can start a chain
                    of events to occur within a house, such as turning off
                    lights, locking doors, activating the HVAC system to
                    introduce chemicals into the environment and cause a fire or
                    explosion to take place.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This development shows how law enforcement is catching up
                    with technological advancements. Smart home devices started
                    becoming common in the mid-to-late-2010s, with many users
                    installing them to automate several aspects of their houses
                    and bolster security. So, anyone with a little bit of
                    technical know-how and ingenuity could potentially create a
                    hostile environment using readily available wireless
                    electronics. While NEO might not be able to affect
                    hard-wired smart devices, it would still be able to disable
                    the radio frequencies most wireless IoT devices use, thus
                    reducing the risks for law enforcement officers.

                    Their research focuses on the science of ultrasound
                    cross-device tracking (uXDT), a new technology that started
                    being deployed in modern-day advertising platforms around
                    2014.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    uXDT relies on advertisers hiding ultrasounds in their ads.
                    When the ad plays on a TV or radio, or some ad code runs on
                    a mobile or computer, it emits ultrasounds that get picked
                    up by the microphone of nearby laptops, desktops, tablets or
                    smartphones.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These second-stage devices, who silently listen in the
                    background, will interpret these ultrasounds, which contain
                    hidden instructions, telling them to ping back to the
                    advertiser's server with details about that device.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Advertisers use uXDT in order to link different devices to
                    the same person and create better advertising profiles so to
                    deliver better-targeted ads in the future.

                Fermilab is a major US national lab with a budget of several
                100M$ per year, focusing on particle physics. All is not well at
                the lab, however, following project delays and huge cost
                overruns for the flagship DUNE project. The organisation that
                operates Fermilab, led by University of Chicago, has

                and the lab director Lia Merminga has been laid off. Now a pair
                of senior and well-respected scientists have put their oar in as
                well, blasting the management of the lab over the past decade
                that has led to the current situation in a paper posted to the
                arxiv preprint server. The pair point at many problems, based on
                a toxic working environment, giving anecdotal examples supported
                by indicators such as a fourfold increase in sick leave over the
                past decade.

                    [...] Using AI, companies can now answer questions like,
                    "What is this person going to buy next? What do we think
                    they're going to be willing to pay? Where are they going to
                    buy from? When are they going to buy it?" said Jain.

                  <p>
                    Matt Pavich, senior director of strategy and innovation at
                    Revionics, an AI company that specializes in helping
                    retailers set prices, said its goal is not to tell retailers
                    exactly how much to charge individual customers. Rather, its
                    bread and butter is to provide companies with "all of the
                    analytics and predictive scenarios" to figure out prices
                    themselves.

                  <p>
                    Instead of waiting for customers to respond in real time to
                    price changes, Revionics' clients get a toolbox to test out
                    prices in advance. Then, by predicting how much consumers
                    will buy at different price points, Revionics helps
                    retailers manage their inventories.

                    [...] Mary Winn Pilkington, senior vice president of
                    investor relations and public relations at Tractor Supply
                    Co., told CNN it recently partnered with Revionics because
                    it wanted to more successfully adjust prices to "the
                    ever-changing market" to "attract and retain customers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The aim of partnering with Revionics wasn't to see how high
                    they can raise their prices without turning away too many
                    customers, she said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She noted that Tractor Supply Co. does use machine learning
                    "to curate specific offers individualized for customers,"
                    although Revionics is not involved in that aspect. This, she
                    said, "often leads to lower prices and better value on the
                    products and services our customers need."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, like my Starbucks experience, it could also very
                    well lead to identifying customers who don't require
                    promotions at all.

                  <p>
                    The surprising discovery challenges long-held assumptions
                    that only photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and
                    algae, generate Earth's oxygen. But the new finding shows
                    there might be another way. It appears oxygen also can be
                    produced at the seafloor -- where no light can penetrate --
                    to support the oxygen-breathing (aerobic) sea life living in
                    complete darkness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Andrew Sweetman, of the Scottish Association for Marine
                    Science (SAMS), made the "dark oxygen" discovery while
                    conducting ship-based fieldwork in the Pacific Ocean.
                    Northwestern's Franz Geiger led the electrochemistry
                    experiments, which potentially explain the finding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For aerobic life to begin on the planet, there had to be
                    oxygen, and our understanding has been that Earth's oxygen
                    supply began with photosynthetic organisms," said Sweetman,
                    who leads the Seafloor Ecology and Biogeochemistry research
                    group at SAMS. "But we now know that there is oxygen
                    produced in the deep sea, where there is no light. I think
                    we, therefore, need to revisit questions like: Where could
                    aerobic life have begun?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Polymetallic nodules -- natural mineral deposits that form
                    on the ocean floor -- sit at the heart of the discovery. A
                    mix of various minerals, the nodules measure anywhere
                    between tiny particles and an average potato in size.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The polymetallic nodules that produce this oxygen contain
                    metals such as cobalt, nickel, copper, lithium and manganese
                    -- which are all critical elements used in batteries," said
                    Geiger, who co-authored the study. "Several large-scale
                    mining companies now aim to extract these precious elements
                    from the seafloor at depths of 10,000 to 20,000 feet below
                    the surface. We need to rethink how to mine these materials,
                    so that we do not deplete the oxygen source for deep-sea
                    life."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Sweetman made the discovery while sampling the seabed
                    of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a mountainous submarine
                    ridge along the seafloor that extends nearly 4,500 miles
                    along the north-east quadrant of the Pacific Ocean. When his
                    team initially detected oxygen, he assumed the equipment
                    must be broken.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When we first got this data, we thought the sensors were
                    faulty because every study ever done in the deep sea has
                    only seen oxygen being consumed rather than produced,"
                    Sweetman said. "We would come home and recalibrate the
                    sensors, but, over the course of 10 years, these strange
                    oxygen readings kept showing up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We decided to take a back-up method that worked differently
                    to the optode sensors we were using. When both methods came
                    back with the same result, we knew we were onto something
                    ground-breaking and unthought-of."

                    A new form of oxygen production has been detected on the
                    ocean floor, raising concerns about the impact of deep-sea
                    mining to this vital ecosystem.

                  <p>
                    Researchers have discovered large amounts of oxygen being
                    produced deep in the Pacific Ocean – and the source appears
                    to be lumps of metal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers made the discovery in a region of the ocean
                    4,000 metres down, where a large amount of “polymetallic
                    nodules” cover the ocean floor. The scientists believe that
                    these nodules are producing this “dark oxygen”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team said the discovery is fascinating, as it suggests
                    there is another source of oxygen production other than
                    photosynthesis. It is believed that these metal nodules are
                    acting as “geo-batteries”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These nodules are believed to play a role in the dark oxygen
                    production (DOP) by catalysing the splitting of water
                    molecules. The researchers say further investigation needs
                    to be done after this discovery to see how this process
                    could be impacted by

                  <p>
                    [...] Sweetman said that researchers should map the areas
                    where oxygen production is occurring before deep-sea mining
                    occurs, due to the potential impact it could have on
                    ecosystems.

                  <p>
                    “If there’s oxygen being produced in large amounts, it’s
                    possibly going to be important for the animals that are
                    living there,” he said.

                    [...] Google's mention of a new option in Chrome for
                    managing third-party cookies seems hazy. The browser already
                    offers users a way to stop third-party cookies. The process
                    is as simple as going to Settings, selecting "Privacy and
                    security," clicking "Third-party cookies," and then turning
                    on the switch to block them. What more could Google add to
                    the browser without making the process too confusing?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I imagine this change simply means you will get an annoying
                    pop-up like this on every new website you visit -- kind of
                    what happens currently in the EU," Longacre said. "So yes,
                    expect more annoying EU-style pop-ups on every site you
                    visit. This will be bad for UX [user experience], but will
                    keep the regulators happy on both sides of the Atlantic."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, the entire process has been largely driven by
                    regulators, according to Longacre, as people are upset over
                    how their personal information is handled online. Users feel
                    that cookies and other digital advertising tools that
                    collect their data are intrusive, and they don't trust the
                    tech world, he added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Privacy is now regarded as a fundamental right, and
                    organizations are moving swiftly to safeguard consumer PII
                    (personally identifiable information), with limited or no
                    movement of consumer data and capturing of consent,"
                    Longacre said. "Google's announcement today will neither
                    slow down nor reverse this process."

                    Separation processes underpin most aspects of modern life.
                    From the food we eat, to the medicines we take, and the
                    fuels or batteries in our car, most products we use have
                    been through several separation processes. Moreover,
                    separation processes are important for minimizing waste and
                    the need for environmental remediation, such as direct air
                    capture of carbon dioxide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, in a world moving towards a circular economy,
                    separation processes will become even more critical. Here,
                    direct air capture might be used to provide carbon dioxide
                    as a feedstock for making many of the hydrocarbon products
                    we use today, but in a carbon-neutral, or even
                    carbon-negative, cycle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most importantly, alongside transitioning to renewable
                    energy and traditional carbon capture from point sources
                    like power plants,

                    is necessary for realizing climate targets, such as the 1.5

                    Dr. Evangelos Papaioannou, Senior Lecturer in the School of
                    Engineering, Newcastle University, UK explains, “In a
                    departure from typical membrane operation, and as described
                    in the research paper, the team tested a new carbon
                    dioxide-permeable membrane with a variety of humidity
                    differences applied across it. When the humidity was higher
                    on the output side of the membrane, the membrane
                    spontaneously pumped carbon dioxide into that output
                    stream.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using X-ray micro-computed tomography with collaborators at
                    UCL and the University of Oxford, the team was able to
                    precisely characterize the structure of the membrane. This
                    enabled them to provide robust performance comparisons with
                    other state-of-the-art membranes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A key aspect of the work was modeling the processes
                    occurring in the membrane at the molecular scale. Using
                    density-functional-theory calculations with a collaborator
                    affiliated to both Victoria University of Wellington and
                    Imperial College London, the team identified ‘carriers’
                    within the membrane. The carrier uniquely transports both
                    carbon dioxide and water but nothing else. Water is required
                    to release carbon dioxide from the membrane, and carbon
                    dioxide is required to release water. Because of this, the
                    energy from a humidity difference can be used to drive
                    carbon dioxide through the membrane from a low concentration
                    to a higher concentration.
                  </p>

                    Prof Metcalfe adds, “This was a real team effort over
                    several years. We are very grateful for the contributions
                    from our collaborators, and for the support from the Royal
                    Academy of Engineering and the Engineering &amp; Physical
                    Sciences Research Council.”

                    with an enhanced version of Black Diamond, which reduces the
                    minimum k-value even further, enabling copper wiring scaling
                    to the 2nm node while also increasing mechanical strength –
                    a critical property as chipmakers look to stack multiple
                    logic and memory dies vertically.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But scaling the copper wiring itself as dimensions shrink is
                    another enormous challenge. Today's most cutting-edge logic
                    chips can pack over 60 miles of copper wires that are
                    fashioned by first etching trenches into the dielectric
                    material and then depositing an ultra-thin barrier layer to
                    prevent copper migration. A liner layer goes down next to
                    aid copper adhesion before the final copper deposition fills
                    the remaining space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem is that at 2nm dimensions and below, the barrier
                    and liner layers consume an increasingly large percentage of
                    the available trench volume, leaving little room for
                    sufficient copper fill and risking high resistance and
                    reliability issues. Applied Materials has solved this
                    predicament with this brand-new materials concoction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their latest Integrated Materials Solution (IMS) combines
                    six different core technologies into one high-vacuum system,
                    including an industry-first pairing of ruthenium and cobalt
                    to form an ultra-thin 2nm binary metal liner. This allows a
                    33% reduction in liner thickness compared to previous
                    generations while also improving surface properties for
                    seamless, void-free copper adhesion and reflow. The end
                    result is up to 25% lower electrical resistance in chip
                    wiring to boost performance and reduce power leakage.

                  <p>
                    Applied Materials claims that all leading logic chipmakers
                    have already adopted its new copper barrier seed IMS with
                    ruthenium CVD technology for 3nm chip production, with 2nm
                    nodes expected to follow.

                    UK communications regulator Ofcom has banned mid-contract
                    price rises linked to inflation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The change, which comes into effect from January 2025, means
                    that price rises must be clearly written into contracts.
                    Ofcom noted that BT and Vodafone had already changed their
                    pricing practices accordingly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cristina Luna-Esteban, Ofcom Telecoms Policy Director,
                    criticized the practice of vendors tying customers into
                    contracts where the price could change based on inflation.
                    Future inflation is difficult to predict, after all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Luna-Esteban said. "We're stepping in on behalf of phone,
                    broadband and pay TV customers to stamp out this practice,
                    so people can be certain of the price they will pay, compare
                    deals more easily and take advantage of the competitive
                    market we have in the UK."

                    after UK inflation soared during the previous years, making
                    it impossible for customers to predict what they might be
                    paying during a contract's term. The imposition of early
                    termination fees for customers seeking to escape what they
                    saw as an unexpected rise added to the pain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In theory, a customer could exit a contract without penalty
                    if they weren't made aware of potential rises when signing
                    the contract. However, providers were able to get around
                    this by simply saying prices would rise by whatever the
                    consumer price index was at the time, plus a certain
                    percentage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, the customer was made aware of a rise – but
                    didn't know what it would be.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ofcom's solution is to require the provider to clearly
                    disclose the rises to avoid a situation in which customers
                    do not know how much they will be expected to pay during
                    their contract term.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Finally, broadband and mobile customers will know
                    ahead of time exactly what they will pay for the duration of
                    a contract, making it easier for them to properly manage
                    their finances."

                    The change to remove the word <em>caffra</em> from species
                    names was proposed by the plant taxonomist Prof Gideon Smith
                    of Nelson Mandela University in South Africa, and his
                    colleague Prof Estrela Figueiredo. They have campaigned for
                    years for changes to be made to the international system for
                    giving scientific names to plants and animals in order to
                    permit the deletion and substitution of past names deemed
                    objectionable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are very pleased with the retroactive and permanent
                    eradication of a racial slur from botanical nomenclature,"
                    Smith told the <em>Observer</em>. "It is most encouraging
                    that more than 60% of our international colleagues supported
                    this proposal."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And the Australian plant taxonomist Kevin Thiele – who had
                    originally pressed for historical past names to be subject
                    to changes as well as future names – told
                    <em>Nature</em> that last week's moves were "at least a
                    sliver of recognition of the issue".

                      >only a part of the taxonomic controversy</a
                    >, however. Naming animals after racists, fascists and other
                    controversial figures cause just as many headaches as those
                    posed by plants, say scientists. Examples include a brown,
                    eyeless beetle which has been named after Adolf Hitler. Nor
                    is <em>Anophthalmus hitleri</em> alone. Many other species'
                    names recall individuals that offend, such as the moth
                    <em>Hypopta mussolinii</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature
                    (ICZN) has so far refused to consider changing its rules to
                    allow the removal of racist or fascist references. Renaming
                    would be disruptive, while replacement names could one day
                    be seen as offensive "as attitudes change in the future", it
                    announced in the
                    <em>Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society</em>last year.
                    Nevertheless, many researchers have acknowledged that some
                    changes will have to be made to zoological nomenclature
                    rules in the near future.

                    We were sick of the academic publishing racket and had
                    decided to try something different. We wanted to launch a
                    journal that would be truly open access, ensuring anyone
                    could read our articles. This will be published by the
                    <a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/"
                      >Open Library of Humanities</a
                    >, a not-for-profit publisher funded by a consortium of
                    libraries and other institutions. When academic publishing
                    is run on a not-for-profit basis, it works reasonably well.
                    These publishers provide a real service and typically sell
                    the final product at a reasonable price to their own
                    community. So why aren't there more of them?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To answer this, we have to go back a few decades, when
                    commercial publishers began

                    journals from university presses. Exploiting their monopoly
                    position, they then sharply raised prices. Today, a library
                    subscription to a single journal in the humanities or social
                    sciences typically costs more than £1,000 a year. Worse
                    still, publishers often "<a
                      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1150298/"
                      >bundle</a
                    >" journals together, forcing libraries to buy ones they
                    don't want in order to have access to ones they do. Between
                    2010 and 2019, UK universities paid
                    <a
                      href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade"
                      >more than £1bn</a
                    >
                    in journal subscriptions and other publishing charges. More
                    than 90% of these fees went to the big five commercial
                    publishers (UCL and Manchester shelled out over £4m each).
                    It's worth remembering that the universities funded this
                    research, paid the salaries of the academics who produced it
                    and then had to pay millions of pounds to commercial
                    publishers in order to access the end product.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even more astonishing is the fact these publishers often
                    charge authors for the privilege of publishing in their
                    journals. In recent years, large publishers have begun
                    offering so-called "open access" articles that are free to
                    read. On the surface, this might sound like a welcome
                    improvement. But for-profit publishers provide open access
                    to readers only by charging authors, often thousands of
                    pounds, to publish their own articles. Who ends up paying
                    these substantial author fees? Once again, universities. In
                    2022 alone, UK institutions of higher education paid
                    <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10787392"
                      >more than £112m</a
                    >
                    to the big five to secure open-access publication for their
                    authors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This trend is having an insidious impact on knowledge
                    production. Commercial publishers are incentivised to try to
                    publish as many articles and journals as possible, because
                    each additional article brings in more profit. This has led
                    to a proliferation of junk journals that publish
                    <a
                      href="https://www.wsj.com/science/academic-studies-research-paper-mills-journals-publishing-f5a3d4bc"
                      >fake research</a
                    >, and has increased the pressure on rigorous journals to
                    weaken their quality controls. It's never been more evident
                    that for-profit publishing simply does not align with the
                    aims of scholarly inquiry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is an obvious alternative: universities, libraries,
                    and academic funding agencies can cut out the intermediary
                    and directly fund journals themselves, at a far lower cost.
                    This would remove commercial pressures from the editorial
                    process, preserve editorial integrity and make research
                    accessible to all. The term for this is
                    <a
                      href="https://www.coalition-s.org/diamond-open-access/#:~:text=Diamond%20Open%20Access%20refers%20to,and%20academic-owned%20publishing%20initiatives."
                      >"diamond" open access</a
                    >, which means the publishers charge neither authors,
                    editors, nor readers (this is how our new journal will
                    operate). Librarians have been urging this for years. So why
                    haven't academics already migrated to diamond journals?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The reason is that such journals require alternative funding
                    sources, and even if such funding were in place, academics
                    still face a massive collective action problem: we want a
                    new arrangement but each of us, individually, is strongly
                    incentivised to stick with the status quo. Career
                    advancement depends heavily on publishing in journals with
                    established name recognition and prestige, and these
                    journals are often owned by commercial publishers. Many
                    academics – particularly early-career researchers trying to
                    secure long-term employment in an extremely difficult job
                    market – cannot afford to take a chance on new, untested
                    journals on their own.

                    Beyond disappearing ice cover, the remaining ice is also
                    growing less reflective as warming temperatures and
                    increased rainfall create thinner, wetter ice and more melt
                    ponds that reflect less solar radiation. This effect has
                    been most pronounced in the Arctic, where sea ice has become
                    less reflective in the sunniest parts of the year, and the
                    new study raises the possibility that it could be an
                    important factor in the Antarctic, too—in addition to lost
                    sea ice cover.

                    The £3.2 billion ($4.1 billion) budget authority has become
                    infamous for its ERP project disaster, which has seen its
                    switch from legacy SAP software to cloud-based Oracle
                    Fusion, a customer win co-founder and CTO Larry Ellison once
                    flaunted to investors.

                    The delayed project left the council without auditable
                    accounts, and without security features, along with costs
                    climbing from around £20 million to as much as £131 million.

                    Yesterday, Mark Stocks, head of public sector practice at
                    external auditors Grant Thornton,
                    <a
                      href="https://birmingham.public-i.tv/core/portal/webcast_interactive/890082"

                    that officials had told him the new accounting
                    “out-of-the-box” system might not be ready until March 2026,
                    nearly four years after the failing customized system first
                    went live.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lack of a functioning accounting system was making it
                    costly and time consuming to produce a full audit, the
                    auditors concluded after exploratory work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Problems with the customized ERP system were multiple,
                    but cash management, bank reconciliation and accounts
                    receivable were of particular concern. The council has
                    bought third-party software — CivicaPay/Civica Income
                    Management — as the replacement for the banking system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Stocks said officials had been working hard to improve the
                    current Oracle system, and said he did not “lose that
                    message.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nonetheless, serious issues continue. “You're not going to
                    have a fully functioning finance system and cash system
                    [until] April next year. The actual financial ledger could
                    be April 2026. That's really difficult from a finance
                    officer point of view [and] it's particularly difficult from
                    an external audit point of view to draw a conclusion on your
                    accounts,” he said.

                    A research team has proposed a revolutionary polymorphic
                    network environment (PNE) in their study, which seeks to
                    achieve global scalability while addressing the diverse
                    needs of evolving network services. Their framework
                    challenges traditional network designs by creating a
                    versatile “network of networks” that overcomes the
                    limitations of current systems, paving the way for scalable
                    and adaptable network architectures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A recent paper published in <em>Engineering</em> by
                    scientists Wu Jiangxing and his research team introduces a
                    theoretical framework that promises to transform network
                    systems and architectures. The study tackles a critical
                    issue in network design: how to achieve global scalability
                    while meeting the varied demands of evolving services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For decades, the quest for an ideal network capable of
                    seamlessly scaling across various dimensions has remained
                    elusive. The team, however, has identified a critical
                    barrier known as the “impossible service-level agreement
                    (S), multiplexity (M), and variousness (V) triangle”
                    dilemma, which highlights the inherent limitations of
                    traditional unimorphic network systems. These systems
                    struggle to adapt to the growing complexity of services and
                    application scenarios while maintaining global scalability
                    throughout the network’s life cycle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To overcome this challenge, the researchers propose a
                    paradigm shift in network development—an approach they term
                    the polymorphic network environment (PNE). At the core of
                    this framework lies the separation of application network
                    systems from the underlying infrastructure environment. By
                    leveraging core technologies such as network elementization
                    and dynamic resource aggregation, the PNE enables the
                    creation of a versatile “network of networks” capable of
                    accommodating diverse service requirements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Through extensive theoretical analysis and environment
                    testing, the team demonstrates the viability of the PNE
                    model. Results indicate that the framework not only supports
                    multiple application network modalities simultaneously but
                    also aligns with technical and economic constraints, thus
                    paving the way for scalable and adaptable network
                    architectures.

                    in <i>Science Advances</i> reveals a surprising twist in the
                    evolutionary history of complex life. Researchers at Queen
                    Mary University of London have discovered that a
                    single-celled organism, a close relative of animals, harbors
                    the remnants of ancient giant viruses woven into its own
                    genetic code. This finding sheds light on how complex
                    organisms may have acquired some of their genes and
                    highlights the dynamic interplay between viruses and their
                    hosts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study focused on a microbe called Amoebidium, a
                    unicellular parasite found in freshwater environments. By
                    analyzing Amoebidium's genome, the researchers led by Dr.
                    Alex de Mendoza Soler, Senior Lecturer at Queen Mary's
                    School of Biological and Behavioural Sciences, found a
                    surprising abundance of genetic material originating from
                    giant viruses—some of the largest viruses known to science.
                    These viral sequences were heavily methylated, a chemical
                    tag that often silences genes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "These findings challenge our understanding of the
                    relationship between viruses and their hosts," says Dr. de
                    Mendoza Soler. "Traditionally, viruses are seen as invaders,
                    but this study suggests a more complex story. Viral
                    insertions may have played a role in the evolution of
                    complex organisms by providing them with new genes. And this
                    is allowed by the chemical taming of these intruders DNA."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, the findings in Amoebidium offer intriguing
                    parallels to how our own genomes interact with viruses.
                    Similar to Amoebidium, humans and other mammals have
                    remnants of ancient viruses, called endogenous retroviruses,
                    integrated into their DNA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While these remnants were previously thought to be inactive
                    "junk DNA," some might now be beneficial. However, unlike
                    the giant viruses found in Amoebidium, Endogenous
                    retroviruses are much smaller, and the human genome is
                    significantly larger. Future research can explore these
                    similarities and differences to understand the complex
                    interplay between viruses and complex life forms.

                    disrupted operations across various sectors, notably
                    impacting airlines, banks, and healthcare providers. The
                    issue was caused by a problematic channel file delivered via
                    an update from the popular cybersecurity service provider,
                    CrowdStrike. CrowdStrike confirmed that this crash did not
                    impact Mac or Linux PCs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It turns out that similar problems have been occurring for
                    months without much awareness, despite the fact that many
                    may view this as an isolated incident. Users of Debian and
                    Rocky Linux also experienced significant disruptions as a
                    result of CrowdStrike updates, raising serious concerns
                    about the company's software update and testing procedures.
                    These occurrences highlight potential risks for customers
                    who rely on their products daily.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In April, a CrowdStrike update caused all Debian Linux
                    servers in a civic tech lab to crash simultaneously and
                    refuse to boot. The update proved incompatible with the
                    latest stable version of Debian, despite the specific Linux
                    configuration being supposedly supported. The lab's IT team
                    discovered that removing CrowdStrike allowed the machines to
                    boot and reported the incident.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A team member involved in the incident expressed
                    dissatisfaction with CrowdStrike's delayed response. It took
                    them weeks to provide a root cause analysis after
                    acknowledging the issue a day later. The analysis revealed
                    that the Debian Linux configuration was not included in
                    their test matrix.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Crowdstrike's model seems to be 'we push software to your
                    machines any time we want, whether or not it's urgent,
                    without testing it'," lamented the team member.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This was not an isolated incident. CrowdStrike users also
                    reported similar issues after upgrading to RockyLinux 9.4,
                    with their servers crashing due to a kernel bug. Crowdstrike
                    support acknowledged the issue, highlighting a pattern of
                    inadequate testing and insufficient attention to
                    compatibility issues across different operating systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To avoid such issues in the future, CrowdStrike should
                    prioritize rigorous testing across all supported
                    configurations. Additionally, organizations should approach
                    CrowdStrike updates with caution and have contingency plans
                    in place to mitigate potential disruptions.

                    amazing that they can live on any organic matter," Lind Sam
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Niels Thomas Eriksen, a biologist at Aalborg University,
                    told AFP that "insects can eat materials that other animals
                    probably won't so we can make better use" of agricultural
                    byproducts and food waste.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Minimizing waste is one of Enorm's key aims and the
                    manufacturer stressed that the rearing of insects
                    facilitates "the recycling of nutrients".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It takes between 40 and 50 days to produce the finished
                    product, which is mainly flour with a protein content of 55
                    percent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is then distributed across Europe—although Enorm remains
                    discreet about the identity of its customers—used for feed
                    for pig, poultry, fish and pet farms.

                  <p>
                    Yup. A source told IndieWire that Amazon MGM Studios is
                    currently in early development on a sequel to "Spaceballs."
                    Mel Brooks is returning to produce the feature, a direct
                    follow-up to his 1987 "Star Wars" spoof. Josh Gad is also on
                    board to star in and also produce what we'll call
                    "Spaceballs 2."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Josh Greenbaum, who directed "Barb &amp; Star Go to
                    Vista Del Mar" and this year's documentary "Will &amp;
                    Harper," is attached to direct the sequel. He's working from
                    a script by Benji Samit, Dan Hernandez, and Josh Gad. Samit
                    and Hernandez are known for working on "Teenage Mutant Ninja
                    Turtles: Mutant Mayhem," "Pokemon Detective Pikachu," and
                    the upcoming "Lego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Spaceballs" from 1987 starred Brooks, Rick Moranis as
                    Dark Helmet, the late John Candy as the Chewbacca parody
                    Barf, and Bill Pullman as the hero Lone Starr. In classic
                    Brooks fashion the film mercilessly ripped off "Star Wars"
                    and featured everything from heroes fighting with pseudo
                    lightsabers extending from rings, characters using the
                    "Schwartz" to save the day, and even Brooks playing a Yoda
                    parody, Yogurt, who shamelessly plugged fourth-wall-breaking
                    "Spaceballs" merchandise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The film made $38 million worldwide but has become part of
                    the canon of staples for Brooks acolytes. Brooks recently
                    wrote the Hulu series "History of the World: Part II," a
                    sequel to his 1981 sketch film. That series also featured
                    Gad in one episode playing Shakespeare.

                    mostly glowing reviews for their baby products and years of
                    contacting Amazon seeking assistance. They worry Amazon
                    might still be reselling used items, but they cannot stop
                    using the platform because Amazon remains their primary
                    source of sales, the couple told Ars. Last summer, The
