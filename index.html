                    Forcing customers to replace an entire system just because
                    the cheapest component failed might be really profitable, I
                    have no idea... But I do know that it annoyed me enough to
                    make me want to fix it myself. While I understand that what
                    I do next is beyond a large number of Advantage Air
                    customers, in my investigation I found that there seems to
                    be only software choices preventing modern tablets from
                    working with older control systems. Adding a simple "system"
                    chooser to their software applications would give solutions
                    to everyone, while the custom POE connector would ensure
                    they still need their hardware.

                    My family had a new home built in 2019. As part of the build
                    package a large ducted reverse cycle (heatpump) air
                    conditioning system was installed. As it was part of the
                    entire build I am not sure on the specific price of this
                    system but based on other quotes I have seen for a similar
                    sized house I would guess $10k-$12k. The system has two main
                    parts, the actual Daikin airconditioner and an Advantage Air
                    control box in attic that opens the vents to the various
                    zones. This control system is operated by a cheap POE
                    powered Android tablet on the wall of the living room.

                    [...] E-Zone running perfectly on an ancient Samsung Galaxy
                    Tab 4. I was elated. After I gave up on repairing the
                    original, getting this tablet working took only a few hours
                    and was a hell of a lot of fun. This tablet is 10+ years old
                    and yet still is much snappier than the junk that came with
                    the system, but if I want to upgrade to something more
                    powerful, say to control my homeassistant etc... all I need
                    to do is plug it into the usb. But for turning the AC on and
                    off it is more than enough and I am currently waiting on a
                    nice flush connector to arrive then will mount it on the
                    wall.

                    The team used an attosecond X-ray pulse from SLAC’s
                    <a href="https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/"
                      >Linac Coherent Light Source</a
                    >
                    (LCLS), just billionths of a billionth of a second long, to
                    ionize core-level electrons. This process ejected the
                    electrons from the molecules they were studying. They then
                    used a separate laser pulse, which kicked the electrons in a
                    slightly different direction depending on the time they were
                    emitted, to measure the so-called “photoemission delay.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The photoemission delay can be thought of as the time
                    between a molecule absorbing a photon and emitting an
                    electron. These delays, reaching up to 700 attoseconds, were
                    significantly larger than previously predicted, challenging
                    existing theoretical models and opening new avenues for
                    understanding electron behavior. The researchers also
                    discovered that interactions between electrons played an
                    important role in this delay.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “By measuring the angular difference in the direction of the
                    ejected electrons, we could determine the time delay with
                    high precision,” said co-author and SLAC scientist James
                    Cryan. “The ability to measure and interpret these delays
                    helps scientists better analyze experimental results,
                    particularly in fields like protein crystallography and
                    medical imaging, where X-ray interactions with matter are
                    crucial.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study is one of the first in a series of planned
                    experiments aimed at exploring the depths of electron
                    dynamics in different molecular systems. Other research
                    groups have already started using the developed technique to
                    study larger and more complex molecules, revealing new
                    facets of electron behavior and molecular structure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “This is a developing field,” said co-author Agostino
                    Marinelli. “The flexibility of LCLS allows us to probe a
                    wide range of energies and molecular systems, making it a
                    powerful tool for making these types of measurements. This
                    is just the beginning of what we can achieve on these
                    extreme timescales.”

                    The bill, which has been a flashpoint for debate in Silicon

                    train a sophisticated foundation model. Those include making
                    it possible to quickly and fully shut the model down,
                    ensuring the model is protected against “unsafe
                    post-training modifications,” and maintaining a testing
                    procedure to evaluate whether a model or its derivatives is

                    SB 1047 is a highly reasonable bill that asks large AI labs
                    to do what they’ve already committed to doing: test their
                    large models for catastrophic safety risk. “We’ve worked
                    hard all year, with open source advocates, Anthropic, and
                    others, to refine and improve the bill. SB 1047 is well
                    calibrated to what we know about forseeable AI risks, and it
                    deserves to be enacted.”

                    With impressive speed and candor, Rocket Factory Augsburg
                    (RFA) has provided an update on the anomaly that caused last
                    week's rocket firing at SaxaVord in Shetland, Scotland, to
                    end explosively.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first stage of RFA's rocket explodes on the SaxaVord
                    launchpad
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Brieschenk described the anomaly as "a very unusual one."
                    The leading theory is that there was a fire in an oxygen
                    pump, which is difficult to contain and certainly more than
                    the systems on the stage and launch pad could handle. The
                    damage rapidly spread to the other engines, and despite the
                    stage triggering an emergency stop, the explosion happened
                    shortly after.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The horizontal jet of flame from the base of the stage was
                    indicative of the severity of the damage. Brieschenk
                    explained that the compromised engines had damaged the
                    manifold to such an extent that kerosene began leaking from
                    the vent lines. "That was really the point of no return," he
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The kerosene fueled the fire. The flames grew more intense
                    and eventually became an oxygen-fed blaze so severe that
                    "large portions of engines were simply combusted."
                    Brieschenk said the CO<sub>2</sub> and water fire
                    suppression systems were not adequately sized to deal with
                    the unfolding damage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite the inevitable delay following the explosion,
                    Brieschenk was keen to highlight that the stage collapsed in
                    a manner which caused it to topple away from the launch
                    pad's umbilical tower. As a result, the pad remained
                    relatively unscathed, aside from elements like the launch
                    stool that were designed to support the stage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although Brieschenk said RFA was confident in the design of
                    the offending turbopump, he also noted that more than 100
                    improvements were being made to the next first stage, which
                    is currently under construction. Many of these improvements
                    aim to prevent a repeat of the SaxaVord incident, where a
                    single turbopump failure led to the loss of the entire
                    stage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The need to wait for the completion of this first stage,
                    originally intended for the second flight of the RFA One,
                    means that the inaugural launch has been postponed to 2025.
                    The other components, like the second stage, for example,
                    are already at SaxaVord.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company said it was being as transparent as possible
                    regarding the mishap and was sharing its own raw footage of
                    the incident. It wrote: "Maybe other companies or
                    prospective engineers can learn from it."
                  </p>

                    Like many, Sam Curry and I spend a lot of time waiting in
                    airport security lines. If you do this enough, you might
                    sometimes see a special lane at airport security called
                    Known Crewmember (KCM). KCM is a TSA program that allows
                    pilots and flight attendants to bypass security screening,
                    even when flying on domestic personal trips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The KCM process is fairly simple: the employee uses the
                    dedicated lane and presents their KCM barcode or provides
                    the TSA agent their employee number and airline. Various
                    forms of ID need to be presented while the TSA agent's
                    laptop verifies the employment status with the airline. If
                    successful, the employee can access the sterile area without
                    any screening at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A similar system also exists for cockpit access, called the
                    Cockpit Access Security System (CASS). Most aircraft have at
                    least one jumpseat inside the cockpit sitting behind the
                    flying pilots. When pilots need to commute or travel, it is
                    not always possible for them to occupy a revenue seat, so a
                    jumpseat can be used instead. CASS allows the gate agent of
                    a flight to verify that the jumpseater is an authorized
                    pilot. The gate agent can then inform the crew of the flight
                    that the jumpseater was authenticated by CASS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The employment status check is the most critical component
                    of these processes. If the individual doesn't currently work
                    for an airline, they have not had a background check and
                    should not be permitted to bypass security screening or
                    access the cockpit. This process is also responsible for
                    returning the photo of the crewmember to ensure the right
                    person is being authorized for access. So how does this
                    work, when every airline presumably uses a different system
                    to store their employee information? That is what we were
                    wondering, and where it gets interesting...

                    Over the past few decades, scientists have generated a pile
                    of evidence suggesting that a diet rich in saturated fats is
                    enough to cause heart diseases. Besides other problems like
                    diabetes and atherosclerosis, saturated fats have also been
                    linked to life-threatening arrhythmias.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Interestingly, based on animal and human studies, certain
                    omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids seem to have beneficial
                    effects on cardiovascular health. In particular,
                    eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which is found in fish oil, not
                    only has vasodilator and antiplatelet effects, but can even
                    help prevent atrial fibrillation and other arrythmias.
                    Despite EPA being readily available as a dietary supplement,
                    the effect of EPA on cardiomyocytes and their underlying
                    mechanisms of action are not fully understood.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a recent study published online in the
                    <em>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</em>, a
                    research team from Japan set out to bridge this knowledge
                    gap. Led by Associate Professor Masaki Morishima from Kindai
                    University, they investigated the role of EPA in inducing
                    long-term electrical changes in cultured mouse
                    cardiomyocytes using a variety of bioanalytical techniques.
                    Their research article was co-authored by Dr. Katsushige Ono
                    from Oita University and Dr. Kazuki Horikawa from Tokushima
                    University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The main focus of this work was on how an oleic
                    acid/palmitic acid mixture (OAPA), two well-studied
                    saturated fats, impact calcium homeostasis in cardiomyocytes
                    by affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion channels, and whether EPA
                    can rescue these changes and restore normal functioning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Put together, this study has shed some much needed
                    light on the underlying mechanisms by which EPA could
                    bolster heart health. “Although there are techniques and
                    drugs to control arrythmias, methods to prevent them have
                    not been established,” remarks Dr. Morishima. Adding
                    further, she states, “The results of our study suggest that
                    EPA has a protective effect on cardiomyocytes by normalizing
                    abnormalities caused by the intake of excessive amounts of
                    saturated fatty acids, which occurs in high-fat diets.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team envisions that these findings will pave the way for
                    smarter dietary choices and new health guidelines. “While
                    research on nutrients and disease prevention can take a long
                    time, studies like ours lay the groundwork for practical
                    nutritional strategies that could seamlessly fit into
                    everyday diet,” concludes Dr. Morishima, hoping for a
                    healthier future.

                    This is Part 1 of a series of articles investigating various
                    PC floppy protections, as I get them working in MartyPC. It
                    assumes you have a familiarity with the structure of a PC
                    floppy disk and the basic operation of a PC floppy drive.

                    Formaster called their copy protection technology
                    "Copy-Lock," a name which, unfortunately, several other
                    producers of copy-protection technology used for entirely
                    unrelated methods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Formaster flavor of Copy-Lock was not used exclusively
                    on PC - the Series One supported many other different
                    computers such as the Apple II and Commodore 64. Copy
                    protection schemes on those platforms could be much more
                    advanced. This article will specifically look at Copy-Lock
                    as it appeared on the IBM PC platform.

                    When he purchased the album for $2 million in 2015, he also
                    acquired 50 percent of the copyrights to the package. Before
                    the album was seized by the government, Shkreli says he took
                    advantage of his copyright ownership to make copies as he
                    was "permitted to do under his original purchase

                    (PDF) in the case as the two parties prepare to battle
                    things out in court. The injunction prevents Shkreli from
                    "possessing, using, disseminating, or selling any interest
                    in the Wu-Tang Clan album 'Once Upon a Time in Shaolin' (the
                    'Album'), including its data and files or the contents of

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, Shkreli has to turn over "all of his copies, in
                    any form, of the Album or its contents to defense counsel."
                    He also must file an affidavit swearing that he "no longer
                    possesses any copies, in any form, of the Album or its
                    contents."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By the end of September 2024, Shkreli further must submit a
                    list of "the names and contact information of the
                    individuals to whom he distributed the data and files" and

                  <p>
                    1. Obtain a phone. It doesn't need to have an active phone
                    number associated with it, and can be either an old phone
                    you have around or a dedicated burner phone.
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Locate a pay phone.</p>
                  <p>
                    3. Find the pay phone's phone number (call 1-800-444-4444 if
                    it's not written on the phone).
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Make sure the pay phone can receive incoming calls.</p>
                  <p>
                    5. Enter the pay phone number into Signal, and use the 'Call
                    me' option to receive a verification call (this option shows
                    up only after the SMS timer runs out).

                  <p>
                    6. Input the confirmation code, set up a PIN and enable

                    PyScript is a brand-new framework that caused a lot of
                    excitement when
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/pwang">Peter Wang</a>, the CEO
                    and co-founder of

                    phase of development, people on
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/pyscript_dev">social media</a>
                    seem to have already fallen in love with it. This tutorial
                    will get you up to speed with PyScript, while the official
                    documentation is still in the making.

                  <p>
                    [...] One of the goals of PyScript is to make the Web a
                    friendly place for anyone wanting to learn to code,
                    including kids. The framework achieves that goal by not
                    requiring any installation or configuration process beyond
                    your existing text editor and a browser. A side effect is
                    that PyScript simplifies sharing your work with others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In other words, PyScript allows you to use Python,
                    with or without JavaScript, to build interactive websites
                    that don't necessarily have to communicate with a server.
                    The main benefit here is that you can leverage your existing
                    knowledge of Python to enter the world of front-end
                    development, lowering the entry barrier and making it more
                    accessible. But there are many other benefits of using
                    PyScript that you'll learn about later.

                    PyScript wouldn't be possible without building on top of a
                    recent version of
                    <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Pyodide</a>—a

                    The study “not only sheds more light on the far-reaching
                    effects of climate change on ocean environments but
                    highlights that marine conservation and management efforts
                    need to plan for these ongoing changes. If migratory fish
                    are on the move, fishing vessels and coastal communities
                    will also need to adapt. Studies like this will help marine
                    resource agencies be even more dynamic in their
                    decision-making,” said study co-author Tobey Curtis, a
                    fishery management specialist in the Atlantic Highly
                    Migratory Species Management Division of NOAA Fisheries.

                    [...] “We are doing our best to try to figure out what will
                    happen, so that people can adapt and so that we can develop
                    climate-resilient or climate-ready management policies,”

                    He said that historic ways to manage fisheries are static,
                    even though fish move around a lot. “We basically draw a box
                    in the ocean and say whether you can or can’t fish there,”
                    he said. Dynamic ocean management frameworks “must embody
                    expected changes. Otherwise, you are left with your static
                    box in the ocean that doesn’t move, even though the fish may
                    have moved, and the ocean may have changed.”

                    The number of bit barns currently under construction has
                    exploded in the wake of the AI boom, surging nearly 70
                    percent in North America's top markets over the past year to
                    a record high of 3.87 gigawatts, according to a newly
                    published CBRE report.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fastest-growing regions include Atlanta, where the
                    number of datacenter developments increased 76 percent
                    year-over-year to roughly 1.3 gigawatts of capacity.
                    Meanwhile, in Austin and San Antonio, Texas, the report
                    clocked 463 megawatts of new capacity under development,
                    more than quadruple that of the previous year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This rapid expansion of compute resources, however, is being
                    hampered by a shortage of power and extended lead times for
                    critical electrical infrastructure necessary to bring these
                    facilities online, resulting in delays.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When these facilities do come online, only about 20 percent
                    of it will actually be up for grabs for you and I. Nearly 80
                    percent of the 3.87 gigawatts of new capacity has already
                    been spoken for by the major hyperscalers, cloud providers,
                    and rent-a-GPU operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite this, CBRE
                    <a
                      href="https://www.cbre.com/insights/reports/north-america-data-center-trends-h1-2024"

                    >
                    that DC capacity in major markets was up 10 percent in the
                    first half of 2024, with 1.1 gigawatts having come online in
                    the past year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Going forward, CBRE predicts secondary markets in
                    Northern Indiana, Idaho, Arkansas, and Kansas will become
                    hotspots for hyperscale expansion thanks to their abundance
                    of cheap land and power.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Speaking of power, a shortage of transformers, switches, and
                    generators is expected to continue to plague development
                    timelines potentially by as much as four years. If that
                    weren't enough, CBRE notes that if you need that capacity,
                    customers should expect to prelease space between two and
                    four years ahead of time.

                current medium so that the NSA could review the material and

                    On August 26, 2024, the National Security Agency (NSA)
                    released a digital copy of a videotaped lecture, "Future
                    Possibilities: Data, Hardware, Software, and People" that
                    Rear Adm. Grace Hopper gave to the NSA workforce on August
                    19, 1982. This lecture highlights technological foundational
                    principles, valuable perspectives on leadership and shared
                    experiences overcoming challenges in computer science and
                    math. The legacy of Rear Adm. Grace Hopper continues to echo
                    across the intelligence community to light the path for
                    women in STEM.

                >). Renesas paid $5.9bn for Altium, which had a revenue of $263m
                in 2023. Along with the PCB software, Renesas now have control
                of component search website Octopart, which Altium acquired in
                2017.

                    This acquisition is aimed at enhancing its capabilities in
                    digital device design and supporting its digital
                    transformation. This move propels Renesas to become a
                    comprehensive solutions provider rather than just a chip
                    vendor, strengthening its position in the competitive
                    landscape.

                competition for Altium in recent years. What do Soylentils think

                From the "everything is ruined by advertising" comes this gem:

                <a href="https://www.vodxs.com/">https://www.vodxs.com/</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                Now some fool's decided to mount advertising screens to the tops
                of washroom faucets, because, well, I guess you got nothing
                better to do while washing your hands than look at a stupid ad
                at the same time.
              </p>
              <p>
                How long do you think these will last in the real world before
                the users break the screens so they no longer have to look at
                the stupid ads?
              </p>
              <p>
                I cannot imagine these lasting long in many public places.
                Perhaps in an office building or somewhere similar but elsewhere
                I would imagine their life will be measured in days. They will
                have to be powered so now each faucet will have to be wired up -
                never a good idea where water is involved. So what is the
                financial incentive for the place where they will be installed.
                Will somebody else will be getting free advertising from
                something that the installer has had to pay for? Who pays for
                their running costs? Does the manufacturer pay for the
                installation and upkeep? If so, how do they see this making them
                money?

                    outlets say, becoming the latest American tech giant to
                    scale back its presence in the increasingly restrictive
                    China-based market.

                    Antarctic coastline are most at risk to non-native species

                    "Most of these rafting objects arrive at the tip of the
                    Antarctic Peninsula, a region with relatively warm ocean
                    temperatures and often ice-free conditions. These factors
                    make it a likely area for non-native species to first
                    establish," says UNSW Scientia Professor Matthew England,

                    The dramatic drop in Antarctic sea ice over the last couple
                    of years makes these rafting connections particularly
                    concerning.

                    "Sea ice is very abrasive and so acts as a barrier for many
                    non-native species to successfully establish around
                    Antarctica," Dr. Dawson says.

                  <p>
                    "If the recent decline in Antarctic sea ice continues, then
                    living things floating at the surface, or attached to
                    floating objects, could have an easier time colonizing the
                    continent, which may have big impacts on ecosystems."

                    What you would do with a hulking mainframe system like this
                    in 2024 is harder to fathom. We mentioned that the IBM 7070
                    up for auction was used in some weapons research role. They
                    were also positioned as useful for research fields spanning
                    aerospace engineering, weather forecasting, and nuclear

                    However, in 2024, the smartphone in your pocket or a humble
                    Raspberry Pi will comprehensively outgun this type of
                    machine in terms of processing power. Thus, it is probably
                    destined to be bought up by a museum, educational
                    institution, or exhibition space. It might also be a good

                    Following an investigation, the DPA found that, between
                    August 2021 and November 2023, Uber was transferring and
                    storing sensitive data to US servers without the additional

                    Uber's base is in the Netherlands, the DPA led the probe.

                    The DPA said that Uber has now stopped the practice. It's

                    This is the third fine the Dutch watchdog imposes on Uber.

                    on August 22 that the company was able to integrate Amazon
                    Q, its generative AI assistant, into its internal systems to
                    update its foundational software.
                  </p>
                  <p>The result has been a "game changer," Jassy said.</p>
                  <p>
                    "The average time to upgrade an application to Java 17
                    plummeted from what's typically 50 developer-days to just a
                    few hours," he wrote. "We estimate this has saved us the
                    equivalent of 4500 developer-years of work (yes, that number
                    is crazy but, real)."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The AI is not only fast but seems pretty accurate, too,
                    according to his post. Amazon developers shipped 79% of the
                    AI-generated code reviews without any additional changes,
                    Jassy wrote.

                    [...] After the bacteria consume the plastic, the microbes
                    are then dried into a powder that smells a bit like
                    nutritional yeast and has a balance of fats, carbohydrates,
                    and proteins, said Techtmann.

                    describing the microbial portion of the Michigan Tech
                    project, and said that the group’s plans are feasible. But
                    he pointed out a significant challenge: At the moment, only
                    certain microorganisms are considered safe to eat, namely
                    “those we have been eating thorough fermented food and
                    beverages, such as lactic acid bacteria, bacillus, some
                    yeasts.” But these don’t degrade plastics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before using the plastic-eating microbes as food for humans,
                    the research team will submit evidence to regulators
                    indicating that the substance is safe. Joshua Pearce, an
                    electrical engineer at Western University in Ontario,
                    Canada, performed the initial toxicology screening, breaking
                    the microbes down into smaller pieces, which they compared
                    against known toxins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Even if the plastic-eating microbes turn out to be
                    safe for human consumption, Techtmann said, the public might
                    still balk at the prospect of eating something nourished on
                    plastic waste. For this reason, he said, this particular
                    group of microbes might prove most useful on remote military
                    bases or during disaster relief, where it could be consumed
                    short-term, to help people survive.

                    Russia's Ministry of Internal Affairs is warning residents
                    of under-siege regions to switch off home surveillance
                    systems and dating apps to stop Ukraine from using them for
                    intel-gathering purposes.

                    Residents of the Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod regions were
                    issued with the warnings amid what seems like Russia being
                    thoroughly rattled by Ukraine's incursion into the country's

                    These warnings were just two of many included in a public
                    memo aimed at protecting the identities of high-value
                    Russian individuals, including military personnel, law

                    by Ukraine on August 6, during which it surged into Kursk

                    The military was reminded to avoid opening links that come
                    from anyone other than official sources, and, while they're
                    at it, to avoid using devices at all if they contain a

                    The spinal cord plays a critical role in controlling
                    movement and other vital functions, and the ability to
                    record spinal neurons with fine-grained spatial and temporal
                    resolution during unrestrained motion offers a window into
                    the mechanisms that make this possible. Using spinalNET,
                    researchers discovered that the spinal neurons in the
                    central pattern generator — the neuronal circuit that can
                    produce rhythmic motor patterns such as walking in the
                    absence of specific timing information — seem to be involved
                    with a lot more than rhythmic movement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Some of them are strongly correlated with leg movement, but
                    surprisingly, a lot of neurons have no obvious correlation
                    with movement,” Wu said. “This indicates that the spinal
                    circuit controlling rhythmic movement is more complicated
                    than we thought.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers said they hope to help unravel some of this
                    complexity in future research, tackling questions such as
                    the difference between how spinal neurons process reflex
                    motion ⎯ getting startled, for instance ⎯ versus volitional
                    action.

                    and is likely down between 75 and 85% from when Elon took
                    over. And now the Wall Street Journal has a piece
                    recognizing that the banks that financed about $13 billion
                    of the $44 billion Musk needed are admitting that it

                    The headline of the article actually underplays the story,
                    calling it “the worst buyout for banks since the financial
                    crisis.” But that’s just based on the “hang” — the length of
                    time the deal has remained on their books. You see, the way
                    this <em>normally</em> works is that the big banks lend the
                    money and then almost immediately turn around and sell off
                    the debt to other suckers to deal with.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, in the case of Musk and Twitter, the banks immediately
                    rubber-stamped it on the basis of “Ooooh, that Elon, doesn’t
                    he always make money?” and without doing much (if any) due
                    diligence. The entities who would buy the debt actually care
                    about the return (or lack thereof) and were quick to
                    recognize that Musk was going to tank Twitter’s revenue
                    potential.

                  <p>
                    Some of this was known before. Just as Musk was about to
                    officially gain control of Twitter, it was reported that the
                    banks were regretting their decision as they realized they

                  <p>
                    To make matters worse for all involved, it has been reported
                    that the banks agreed to a
                    <a
                      href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/06/elon-musk-twitter-x-financing-wall-street-banks/"
                      >sell-down letter</a
                    >, preventing any bank from taking a deal that isn’t offered
                    to the rest of them. But to make matters even worse for Elon
                    specifically, he apparently
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/elon-musk-told-bankers-they-wouldnt-lose-any-money-on-twitter-purchase/"
                      >promised the bankers they wouldn’t lose money</a
                    >
                    on this deal. It’s unclear how binding that promise is, and
                    Musk is somewhat infamous for breaking promises. But it
                    certainly could impact his ability to borrow in the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That said, the WSJ article highlights that the banks have
                    had to hang on to the (greatly devalued) loans for a record
                    length of time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Maybe the banks will think about due diligence next time? I
                    mean, it was no secret that the basic ideas Musk laid out
                    for how he was going to run Twitter were absolute nonsense
                    from Day One.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, while the headline and the beginning of the piece
                    compare the performance of this deal to the financial
                    crisis, they admit deeper in the article that it may just be
                    one of the worst of all time...[.]

                    time, having flown in from Azerbaijan. The warrant on Durov

                    Locking up merchandise at drugstores and discount retailers
                    hasn't curbed retail theft but is driving frustrated
                    consumers to shop online more, retail experts tell Axios.
                    Retail crime is eating into retailers' profits and high
                    theft rates are also leading to a rise in store closures.
                    Secured cases can cause sales to drop 15% to 25%, Joe
                    Budano, CEO of anti-theft technology company Indyme,
                    previously told Axios. Barricading everything from razors to
                    laundry detergent has largely backfired and broken shopping
                    in America,

                    Aisles full of locked plexiglass cases are common at many
                    CVS and Walgreens stores where consumers have to wait for an
                    employee to unlock them. Target, Walmart, Dollar General and
                    other retailers have also pulled back on self-checkout to
                    deter shoplifting. "Locking up products worsens the shopping
                    experience, and it makes things inconvenient and difficult,"
                    GlobalData retail analyst Neil Saunders said, adding it
                    pushes shoppers to other retailers or to move purchases
                    online.

                    Driving the news: Manmohan Mahajan, Walgreens global chief
                    financial officer, said in a June earnings call that the
                    retailer was experiencing "higher levels of shrink." Amazon
                    CEO Andy Jassy spoke of the "speed and ease" of ordering
                    online versus walking into pharmacies on a call with
                    investors last week. "It's a pretty tough experience with
                    how much is locked behind cabinets, where you have to press
                    a button to get somebody to come out and open the cabinets
                    for you," Jassy said.

                    The historical review and experiment may help solve a puzzle
                    that has fueled decades of debate in archaeology circles:
                    How did communities in North America actually use Clovis
                    points, which are among the most frequently unearthed items
                    from the Ice Age?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Clovis points are often the only recovered part of a
                    spear. The intricately designed bone shafts at the end of
                    the weapon are sometimes found, but the wood at the base of
                    the spear and the pine pitch and lacing that help make them
                    function as a complete system have been lost to time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Plus, research silos limit that kind of systems thinking
                    about prehistoric weaponry, Jun said. And if stone
                    specialists aren't experts in bone, they might not see the
                    full picture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "You have to look beyond the simple artifact," he said. "One
                    of the things that's key here is that we're looking at this
                    as an engineered system that requires multiple kinds of
                    sub-specialties within our field and other fields."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "People who are doing metal military artifact analysis
                    know all about it because it was used for stopping horses in
                    warfare," Byram said. "But prior to that, and in other
                    contexts with boar hunting or bear hunting, it wasn't very
                    well known. It's a theme that comes back in literature quite
                    a bit. But for whatever reason, it hasn't been talked about
                    too much in anthropology."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Sometimes in archaeology, the pieces just start
                    fitting together like they seem to now with Clovis
                    technology, and this puts pike hunting front and center with
                    extinct megafauna," Byram said. "It opens up a whole new way
                    of looking at how people lived among these incredible
                    animals during much of human history."

                    violation of the law. The next year, EFF successfully
                    lobbied the state legislature to order an audit of four
                    agencies, including the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office,

                    Although Boeing did not make an official statement Saturday
                    on its long-term plans for Starliner, NASA Administrator
                    Bill Nelson told reporters he received assurances from
                    Boeing's new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, that the company remains
                    committed to the commercial crew program. And it will take a
                    significant commitment from Boeing to see it through. Under
                    the terms of its fixed price contract with NASA, the company
                    is on the hook to pay for any expenses to fix the thruster
                    and helium leak problems and get Starliner flying again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Boeing has already reported $1.6 billion in charges on its
                    financial statements to pay for delays and cost overruns on
                    the Starliner program. That figure will grow as the company
                    will likely need to redesign some elements in the
                    spacecraft's propulsion system to remedy the problems
                    encountered on the Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission. NASA has
                    committed $5.1 billion to Boeing for the Starliner program,
                    and the agency has already paid out most of that funding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Boeing managers had previously declared Starliner was
                    safe enough to bring Wilmore and Williams home. Mark Nappi,
                    Boeing's Starliner program manager, regularly appeared to
                    downplay the seriousness of the thruster issues during press
                    conferences throughout Starliner's nearly three-month
                    mission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So why did NASA and Boeing engineers reach different
                    conclusions? "I think we're looking at the data and we view
                    the data and the uncertainty that's there differently than
                    Boeing does," said Jim Free, NASA's associate administrator,
                    and the agency's most senior civil servant. "It's not a
                    matter of trust. It's our technical expertise and our
                    experience that we have to balance. We balance risk across
                    everything, not just Starliner."

                    Across different cultures and countries, people perceive the
                    wisest people to be logical and reflective as well as able
                    to consider other people's feelings and perceptions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What makes someone seem wise? People view wisdom through the
                    lens of applying knowledge and thinking logically as well as
                    considering others' feelings and perceptions, finds a new
                    study led by University of Waterloo researchers who looked
                    at perceptions of wisdom across 12 countries and five
                    continents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers examined the underlying principles guiding who
                    we perceive as wise in political leadership, science, and
                    daily life. Across different cultures, participants'
                    judgements converged on two dimensions: reflective
                    orientation and socio-emotional awareness. Reflective
                    orientation includes characteristics such as thinking
                    logically, emotion control and application of knowledge.
                    Socio-emotional awareness includes characteristics like care
                    for other's feelings and attention to social context.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To our surprise, the two dimensions emerged across all
                    cultural regions we studied, and both were associated with
                    explicit attribution of wisdom," said Dr. Maksim Rudnev, a
                    postdoctoral research associate in psychology at Waterloo
                    and lead author.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study suggests how people around the world might judge,
                    support and trust leaders, educators and others in positions
                    of influence. One example is how people view U.S. former
                    president Donald Trump and current president Joe Biden.

                <a href="https://blog.isosceles.com/openssh-backdoors/"
                  >two OpenSSH Backdoor attempts</a
                >. One, the XZ backdoor, was attempted this year in early 2024.
                The other, in 2002, was a matter of attempting to trojanize some
                distribution files.

                  <p>
                    Inserting an exploitable bug (a "bugdoor"), one that's
                    subtle enough that developers might not even notice during
                    code review, is probably the winning move. However, it's
                    interesting to note that in both 2002 and 2024 we got a
                    backdoor rather than a bugdoor. That's probably because
                    exploits are hard, and server-side exploits are really hard.
                    Given how much work it is to be in a position to change the
                    source code in the first place, it's not entirely surprising
                    that attackers want to go with a reliable option. The
                    counter-argument is that we may just never get to see any
                    bugdoors because they never get caught (or if they do, they
                    don't get flagged as subterfuge), so we're biased towards
                    the events that we can actually detect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are other similarities. Both the 2002 and 2024 events
                    targeted the build system, for example. This also makes
                    sense, because build systems are a perfect mix of
                    inscrutability and expressiveness. There's really no
                    constraints on what you can do with most build systems. They
                    have to be like this in order to make everything work
                    everywhere that it's supposed to. Making something compile
                    on Linux, MacOS, and Windows simultaneously is no easy feat.
                    Add in support for multiple architectures and legacy
                    versions, and well... you see where I'm going with this. The
                    guiding design principle for build systems has been "just
                    make it work", and so they end up being a complicated mess
                    of directives, rules, variables, and command invocations. As
                    long as they're working correctly, I suspect very few people
                    are paying close attention to the contents of their build
                    scripts, and that includes the developers/maintainers
                    themselves. It's the ideal place to insert the first hook
                    for a backdoor, hiding in plain sight.

                    required it to pay media outlets. Under the terms of the
                    deal, Google will commit tens of millions of dollars to a
                    fund supporting local news as well as an AI “accelerator

                  <p>
                    The agreement ends a months-long dispute between lawmakers
                    and Google over the California Journalism Preservation Act,
                    a bill that would have required Google, Meta and other large
                    platforms to pay California publishers in exchange for
                    linking to their websites. Google strongly opposed the
                    measure, which was similar to laws passed in Canada and
                    Australia.

                    The agreement also includes funding for a “National AI

                    unclear, but <em>Cal Matters</em>

                    certainly didn't think it was aliens. But he realized that

                    (a highly magnetic neutron star) passing behind a cloud of

                    Proving their working hypothesis will be much more
                    challenging, although there have been rare sightings of such
                    naturally occurring masers from hydrogen molecules in space.
                    But nobody has ever spotted an atomic hydrogen cloud with an
                    associated maser, and that's what would be needed to explain
                    the intensity of the Wow! signal. That's why other
                    astronomers are opting for cautious skepticism. “A magnetar
                    is going to produce [short] radio emissions as well. Do you
                    really need this complicated maser stuff happening as well

                    In a new letter, OpenAI chief strategy officer Jason Kwon
                    insists that AI regulations should be left to the federal
                    government. As reported previously by

                      ><em>Bloomberg</em></a
                    >, Kwon says that a new AI safety bill under consideration
                    in California could slow progress and cause companies to
                    leave the state.

                    According to proponents like Wiener, it establishes
                    standards ahead of the development of more powerful AI
                    models, requires precautions like pre-deployment safety
                    testing and other safeguards, adds whistleblower protections
                    for employees of AI labs, gives California’s Attorney
                    General power to take legal action if AI models cause harm,
                    and calls for establishing a “public cloud computer cluster”
                    called CalCompute.

                    published Wednesday evening, Wiener points out that the
                    proposed requirements apply to any company doing business in
                    California, whether they are headquartered in the state or
                    not, so the argument “makes no sense.” He also writes that
                    OpenAI “...doesn’t criticize a single provision of the bill”
                    and closes by saying, “SB 1047 is a highly reasonable bill
                    that asks large AI labs to do what they’ve already committed
                    to doing, namely, test their large models for catastrophic
                    safety risk.”

                    Apple device users recently discovered a minor bug that
                    causes the Settings screen and home screen to crash. While
                    no serious issues have been reported so far, a fix in a
                    future firmware update would not be surprising.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Swiping right on the iOS home screen until the app library
                    appears, and then typing the characters "::" into the search
                    bar, causes Springboard – the software that handles the main
                    menu – to crash. A black screen with a loading icon briefly
                    appears before the device returns to the lock screen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, entering the same characters into the search
                    bar at the top of the Settings menu crashes the app,
                    immediately sending users back to the home screen. However,
                    the bug can be triggered by variations of this character
                    combination as well.
                  </p>

                    that nearly any combination involving two quotation marks,
                    one colon, and any other character can trigger the same
                    effect. For example, typing "X":X also causes the issue.
                    TechSpot confirmed that the bug occurs on iPhones and iPads
                    running firmware version 17.6.1, but Macs remain unaffected.

                    resembles more serious incidents from the past.

                    For example, particles ejected at velocities below 500 m/s
                    could reach Mars in about 13 years, whereas those ejected at
                    velocities exceeding 1.5 km/s (5,400 km/h; 3,355 mph) could
                    reach Earth in as little as seven years. However, their
                    simulations indicated that it will likely be up to 30 years
                    before any of this ejecta is observed on Earth.

                    "However, these faster particles are expected to be too
                    small to produce visible meteors, based on early
                    observations," said Peña-Asensio.

                    critical in determining whether DART has created a new (and

                    observing campaigns in the coming decades will have the last
                    word. If these ejected Dimorphos fragments reach Earth, they
                    will not pose any risk. Their small size and high speed will
                    cause them to disintegrate in the atmosphere, creating a

                Also what is the difference between a programmer and a
                developer? One apparently loves AI while the other one shuns it
                like the plague according to their summary table. It's unclear
                except something about how they self-identify on their business
                cards?

              <p>
                If AI improves your code then does that not scare these people?
                After all eventually you'll be cut from the loop, cause you are
                a cost. Perhaps coders in Germany are just better then the
                coders in America and India?

                That appears more and more to be the fantasy that they want to
                sell. For companies they want to get rid of the humans since
                they are costs. If the AI can do their job somewhat equally.
                There doesn't appear to be much in the way of backing up that
                statement in reality.

                It appears to be free up time to upskill (?) your something
                something as you fulfill more customer requirements ... Perhaps
                it frees up more time to invent new words and concepts that they
                can use in sentences to sound important.

                    The new Fifth Circuit case, <em>United States v. Smith</em>,
                    involved an armed robbery and assault of a US Postal Service
                    worker at a post office in Mississippi in 2018. After
                    several months of investigation, police had no identifiable
                    suspects, so they obtained a geofence warrant covering a
                    large geographic area around the post office for the hour
                    surrounding the crime. Google responded to the warrant with
                    information on several devices, ultimately leading police to
                    the two defendants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On appeal, the Fifth Circuit reached several important
                    holdings.

                  <p>
                    First, it determined that under the Supreme Court's landmark
                    ruling in <em>Carpenter v. United States</em>, individuals
                    have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the location
                    data implicated by geofence warrants. As a result, the court
                    broke from the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/eff-tells-minnesota-supreme-court-strike-down-geofence-warrant-fourth-circuit"
                      >Fourth Circuit's deeply flawed decision last month</a
                    >
                    in <em>United States v. Chatrie</em>, noting that although
                    geofence warrants can be more "limited temporally" than the
                    data sought in <em>Carpenter</em>, geofence location data is
                    still highly invasive because it can expose sensitive
                    information about a person's associations and allow police
                    to "follow" them into private spaces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, the court found that even though investigators seek
                    warrants for geofence location data, these searches are
                    inherently unconstitutional. As the court noted, geofence
                    warrants require a provider, almost always Google, to search
                    "the entirety" of its reserve of location data "while law
                    enforcement officials have no idea who they are looking for,
                    or whether the search will even turn up a result."
                    Therefore, "the quintessential problem with these warrants
                    is that they <em>never</em> include a specific user to be
                    identified, only a temporal and geographic location where
                    any given user <em>may</em> turn up post-search. That is
                    constitutionally insufficient."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unsurprisingly, however, the court found that in 2018,
                    police could have relied on such a warrant in "good faith,"
                    because geofence technology was novel, and police reached
                    out to other agencies with more experience for guidance.
                    This means that the evidence they obtained will not be
                    suppressed in this case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nevertheless, it is gratifying to see an appeals court
                    recognize the fundamental invasions of privacy created by
                    these warrants and uphold our constitutional tradition
                    prohibiting general searches. Police around the country have
                    increasingly relied on geofence warrants and other reverse
                    warrants, and this opinion should act as a warning against

                    Facebook, X, YouTube and other social media platforms rely
                    on a 1996 law to insulate themselves from legal liability
                    for user posts. The protection from this law,
                    <a

                      >Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</a
                    >, is so significant that it has allowed tech companies to
                    flourish.<br />But what if the same law could be used to
                    rein in the power of those social media giants?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That idea is at the heart of a lawsuit filed in May against
                    Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The
                    plaintiff has asked a federal court to declare that a
                    little-used part of Section 230 makes it permissible for him
                    to release his own software that lets users automatically
                    unfollow everyone on Facebook.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit, filed by Ethan Zuckerman, a public policy
                    professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, is the
                    first to use Section 230 against a tech giant in this way,
                    his lawyers said. It is
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/technology/section-230-explainer.html"
                      >an unusual</a
                    >
                    legal maneuver that could turn a law that typically protects
                    companies like Meta on its head. And if Mr. Zuckerman
                    succeeds, it could mean more power for consumers to control
                    what they see online.<br />[...]<br />Mr. Zuckerman has
                    focused on a part of Section 230 that spells out protection
                    for blocking objectionable material online. In 2021, after a
                    developer released software to purge users' Facebook feeds
                    of everyone they follow, Facebook threatened to shut it
                    down. But Section 230 says it is possible to restrict access
                    to obscene, excessively violent and other problematic
                    content. The language shields companies from liability if
                    they censor disturbing content, but lawyers now say it could
                    also be used to justify scrubbing any content users don't
                    want to see.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meta said it had asked U.S. District Court for the Northern
                    District of California, where the lawsuit was filed, to
                    dismiss the case because Mr. Zuckerman had not released a
                    software tool to clean up people's Facebook pages. It also
                    argued that Mr. Zuckerman had not shown that Section 230
                    should apply in his case.

                    AP reported yesterday that "Disney drops bid to have
                    allergy-death lawsuit tossed because plaintiff signed up for
                    Disney+."

                    I'm not a lawyer but the initial legal argument being made
                    by Disney seems to me to be pure bad faith horseshit. This
                    piece in New York Magazine looks at the lawsuit stemming
                    from the allergic reaction death of a doctor named Amy
                    Tangsuan at a Disney World Resort restaurant:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        Tangsuan was allergic to dairy and nuts, and before she
                        and her husband ordered, (they) asked a waiter whether
                        any of the allergens were in her order... The waiter
                        consulted with the chef, and then assured her that they
                        could be made dairy- and nut-free.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        About 45 minutes after Tangsuan ate, she went into an
                        anaphylactic shock so severe her EpiPen was useless. She
                        died soon after at a nearby hospital. In February, her
                        husband filed a wrongful-death suit against the
                        restaurant and Disney's theme-parks division, seeking
                        money damages.
                      </p>

                    [...] Did they try this now abandoned tactic to save money?
                    Of course. But it sounds like they're really doing it to
                    save face — by moving cases to arbitration, it's permanently
                    out of the public's view; however the case is settled, the
                    general public will almost certainly be in the dark. PR
                    problem of killing guests thus solved.

                      >launched on June 5</a
                    >, and is the first flight of the Starliner spacecraft to
                    the International Space Station with astronauts. The flight
                    test aims to prove the system is ready for rotational
                    missions to the space station. NASA wants two American
                    spacecraft, in addition to the Roscosmos Soyuz spacecraft,
                    capable of carrying astronauts to help ensure a permanent
                    crew aboard the orbiting complex.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This flight test aims to demonstrate Starliner’s ability to
                    execute a six-month rotational mission to the space station.
                    The flight test objectives were developed to support NASA’s
                    certification process and gather the performance data needed
                    to evaluate readiness ahead of long-duration flights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During Starliner’s flight to the space station, some of the
                    spacecraft’s thrusters did not perform as expected and
                    several leaks in Starliner’s helium system were observed.
                    While the initial mission duration was planned for about a
                    week, there is no rush to bring crew home, so NASA and
                    Boeing are taking additional time to learn about the
                    spacecraft. This is a lesson learned from the space shuttle
                    Columbia accident. Our NASA and Boeing teams are poring over
                    data from additional in-space and ground testing and
                    analysis, providing mission managers data to make the best,
                    safest decision on how and when to return crew home.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Starliner remains the primary option for Butch and Suni if
                    an emergency occurs and they need to rapidly depart the
                    station. There is no urgent need to bring them home, and
                    NASA is using the extra time to understand the spacecraft’s
                    technical issues before deciding on a return plan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If NASA decides to return Starliner uncrewed, Butch and Suni
                    would remain aboard station until late-February 2025. NASA
                    would replan the agency’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission by launching
                    only two crew members instead of four in late September.
                    Butch and Suni would then return to Earth after the
                    regularly scheduled Crew-9 increment early next year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No decisions have been made. NASA continues to evaluate all
                    options as it learns more about Starliner’s propulsion
                    system. Butch and Suni may return home aboard Starliner, or
                    they could come back as part of the agency’s SpaceX Crew-9
                    mission early next year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yes, Starliner can undock and deorbit autonomously, if NASA
                    decides to return the spacecraft uncrewed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If NASA decides to return them aboard a SpaceX Dragon, NASA
                    will replan its SpaceX Crew-9 mission by launching only two
                    crew members in late September instead of four. Butch and
                    Suni would then return to Earth after the regularly
                    scheduled Crew-9 increment early next year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The main goal of the agency’s Commercial Crew Program is
                    two, unique human spaceflight systems. Should any one system
                    encounter an issue, NASA still has the capability to launch
                    and return crew to ensure safety and a continuous human
                    presence aboard the International Space Station.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No, Butch and Suni are safe aboard the space station working
                    alongside the Expedition 71 crew. They also have been
                    actively involved in Starliner testing and technical
                    meetings. Butch and Suni could return home aboard Starliner
                    if an emergency arises. The agency also has other return
                    options available, if needed, for both contingency and
                    normal returning planning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Butch and Suni each have previously completed two
                    long-duration stays aboard the station. NASA astronauts
                    embark on missions fully aware of the various scenarios that
                    may become reality. This mission is no different, and they
                    understood the possibilities and unknowns of this test
                    flight, including being aboard station longer than planned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A typical stay aboard the International Space Station is
                    about six months, and NASA astronauts also have remained on
                    the space station for

                      >longer duration missions</a
                    >. Previous missions have given NASA volumes of data about
                    long-duration spaceflight and its effects on the human body,
                    which the agency applies to any crew mission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yes. The International Space Station is well-stocked with
                    everything the crew needs, including food, water, clothing,
                    and oxygen. Additionally, NASA and its space station
                    partners frequently launch resupply missions to the orbiting
                    complex carrying additional supplies and cargo.

                    has additional SpaceX resupply missions planned through the
                    end of 2024.

                    The crew continues to monitor Starliner’s flight systems and
                    gather performance data for system certification. NASA also
                    is taking advantage of Butch and Suni’s extra time aboard
                    the orbital laboratory, where they have completed various
                    science experiments, maintenance tasks, and assisted with
                    spacewalk preparations. Some of the science they’ve recently
                    completed includes new ways to

                    Butch and Suni enjoy many of the same comforts we have here
                    on Earth. They can email, call, and video conference with
                    their family and friends when they have “free time” aboard
                    the International Space Station.

                  <p>
                    NASA has two unique American space transportation systems
                    capable of carrying crew to and from station. Although no
                    decisions have been made, NASA is considering several
                    options to return Butch and Suni from the space station,
                    including returning aboard Starliner, if cleared, or as part
                    of the agency’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission in February 2025.

                  <p>
                    Crewed test flights are inherently risky, and although
                    rotation missions may seem routine, they also are not
                    without risk. It is NASA’s job to evaluate that risk and
                    determine whether it is acceptable for the crew ahead of
                    each flight.

                    Microsoft's Patch Tuesday for August 2024 includes a fix for
                    a security vulnerability in the Grub2 boot loader, which is
                    used by many Linux operating systems. Tracked as
                    <a
                      href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-2601"

                    out-of-bounds write with a potential bypass of

                    protection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Grub2 boot loader provides compatibility with the Secure
                    Boot technology on PCs running Linux systems. After
                    installing the new patch, Windows applies a Secure Boot
                    Advanced Targeting (SBAT) policy to block vulnerable Linux
                    boot loaders that could compromise OS security.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft explained that the SBAT value would not be applied
                    to dual-boot systems with both Windows and Linux on the boot
                    drive, so the patch was expected not to impact these
                    systems. However, many users with dual-boot configurations
                    have reported that the CVE-2022-2601 update still rendered
                    booting into a Linux OS impossible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The issue appears to affect various Linux distributions,
                    including popular ones such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin OS,
                    Puppy Linux, and others. Affected systems typically display
                    a "Security Policy Violation" error at boot, indicating a
                    failed check on "shim SBAT data." Boot problems have been
                    reported on both dual-boot systems and on Windows devices
                    running Linux from an
                    <a href="https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/issues/2947"
                      >ISO image</a
                    >, USB drive, or optical media.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft's bulletin noted that only older Linux distros'
                    ISOs were expected to experience boot issues following the
                    CVE-2022-2601 patch. However, users with systems released in
                    2024 also seem to be affected. The only reliable way to
                    restore a bootable state appears to be disabling Secure Boot
                    entirely. Alternatively, users can

                    Microsoft will begin sending a revised version of its
                    controversial Recall feature to Windows Insider PCs
                    beginning in October, according to an update published today
                    to the company's original blog post about the Recall
                    controversy. The company didn't elaborate further on
                    specific changes it's making to Recall beyond what it
                    already announced in June.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For those unfamiliar, Recall is a Windows service that runs
                    in the background on compatible PCs, continuously taking
                    screenshots of user activity, scanning those screenshots
                    with optical character recognition (OCR), and saving the OCR
                    text and the screenshots to a giant searchable database on
                    your PC. The goal, according to Microsoft, is to help users
                    retrace their steps and dig up information about things they
                    had used their PCs to find or do in the past.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem was that other users on the same PC, or
                    attackers with physical or remote access to your PC, could
                    easily access, view, and export those screenshots and the
                    OCR database since none of the information was encrypted at
                    rest or protected in any substantive way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft had planned to launch Recall as one of the
                    flagship features of its Copilot+ PC launch in July, along
                    with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered Surface devices,
                    but its rollout was bumped back and then paused entirely so
                    that Recall could be reworked and then sent out to Windows
                    Insiders for testing like most other Windows features are.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among the changes Microsoft has said it will make: The
                    database will be encrypted at rest and will require
                    authentication (and periodic reauthentication) with Windows
                    Hello before users will be allowed to access it. The feature
                    will also be off by default, whereas the original plan was
                    to turn it on by default and make users go into Settings to
                    turn it off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Security continues to be our top priority and when Recall
                    is available for Windows Insiders in October we will publish
                    a blog with more details," reads today's update to Microsoft
                    Windows and Devices Corporate Vice President Pavan
                    Davuluri's blog post.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the preview is released, Windows Insiders who want to
                    test the Recall preview will need to do it on a PC that
                    meets Microsoft's Copilot+ system requirements. Those
                    include a processor with a neural processing unit (NPU)
                    capable of at least 40 trillion operations per second
                    (TOPS), 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The x86 builds of
                    Windows for Intel and AMD processors don't currently support
                    any Copilot+ features regardless of whether the PC meets
                    those requirements, but that should change later this year.

                    Chen says that similar reactors have been tested before, but
                    the electrodes could not shuffle charges at a sufficient
                    voltage for the reaction to work – unless
                    <a

                    >
                    were added to the wastewater. He and his colleagues made
                    their device more practical by filling its middle chamber
                    with a porous material that plays the role of those salts,
                    so wastewater can be fed directly into the reactor without
                    additives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In experiments with water samples that had realistic
                    concentrations of nitrates, the reactor processed 100
                    millilitres in about an hour, and it kept working well when
                    it ran for 10 days straight. Its performance is similar to
                    that of previous, more complicated reactor designs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team has only tested the reactor in the lab using
                    nitrate-rich water, not real wastewater samples, which
                    contain more than just nitrates, says Chen. But the
                    researchers eventually envision local businesses and farms
                    using these reactors to recycle wastewater, instead of
                    sending it to far-away treatment plants that waste its
                    ammonia-making potential.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the best-case scenario, a farm might have its own
                    reactor, powered by solar or wind power. Farmers could run
                    local wastewater through the device and immediately

                    “We’re still at the academic research level, but this is my
                    ultimate dream,” says Chen.
