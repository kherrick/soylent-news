                <div>
                  <p>
                    The Intel i960 was a remarkable 32-bit processor of the
                    1990s with a confusing set of versions. Although it is now
                    mostly forgotten (outside the many people who used it as an
                    embedded processor), it has a complex history. It had a shot
                    at being Intel's flagship processor until x86 overshadowed
                    it. Later, it was the world's best-selling RISC processor.
                    One variant was a 33-bit processor with a decidedly non-RISC
                    object-oriented instruction set; it became a military
                    standard and was used in the F-22 fighter plane. Another
                    version powered Intel's short-lived Unix servers. In this
                    blog post, I'll take a look at the history of the i960,
                    explain its different variants, and examine silicon dies.
                    This chip has a lot of mythology and confusion (especially
                    on
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_i960"
                      >Wikipedia</a
                    >), so I'll try to clear things up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ancestry of the i960 starts in 1975, when Intel set out
                    to design a "micro-mainframe", a revolutionary processor
                    that would bring the power of mainframe computers to
                    microprocessors. This project, eventually called the iAPX
                    432, was a huge leap in features and complexity. Intel had
                    just released the popular 8080 processor in 1974, an 8-bit
                    processor that kicked off the hobbyist computer era with
                    computers such as the Altair and IMSAI. However, 8-bit
                    microprocessors were toys compared to 16-bit minicomputers
                    like the PDP-11, let alone mainframes like the 32-bit IBM
                    System/370. Most companies were gradually taking
                    minicomputer and mainframe features and putting them into
                    microprocessors, but Intel wanted to leapfrog to a
                    mainframe-class 32-bit processor. The processor would make
                    programmers much more productive by bridging the "semantic
                    gap" between high-level languages and simple processors,
                    implementing many features directly into the processor.

                    The
                    <a
                      href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~levy/capabook/Chapter9.pdf"

                    >
                    included memory management, process management, and
                    interprocess communication. These features were
                    traditionally part of the operating system, but Intel built
                    them in the processor, calling this the "<a
                      href="http://www.bitsavers.org/components/intel/iAPX_432/171821-001_Introduction_to_the_iAPX_432_Architecture_Aug81.pdf"
                      >Silicon Operating System</a
                    >". The processor was also one of the first to implement the
                    new IEEE 754 floating-point standard, still in use by most
                    processors. The 432 also had support for fault tolerance and
                    multi-processor systems. One of the most unusual features of
                    the 432 was that instructions weren't byte aligned. Instead,
                    instructions were between 6 and 321 bits long, and you could
                    jump into the middle of a byte. Another unusual feature was
                    that the 432 was a stack-based machine, pushing and popping
                    values on an in-memory stack, rather than using
                    general-purpose registers.

                    The investigators recruited these patients and performed
                    imaging every few years from 2010 to 2017, yielding an
                    average of 4.6 scans per participant over the course of the
                    study. The scans were used to measure thinning of the layer
                    of the nerve cells — known as ganglion cells — in the retina
                    over time. The average rate of deterioration was a loss of
                    0.32 micrometers of tissue per year in each patient.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, using blood samples from the patients to collect their
                    DNA, the researchers hunted for genetic mutations in those
                    people with the fastest deterioration rates and identified
                    23 such DNA variations that mapped to the complement gene
                    C3.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, to search for genes further linked to vision loss,
                    they performed an analysis of an existing clinical trial
                    group of another 835 people with MS, of whom 74% were women,
                    and whose average age was 40. Each participant underwent
                    periodic vision testing about every year to distinguish
                    their ability to detect contrast — finer and finer shades
                    that distinguish light versus dark. The test requires the
                    person to read five letters in a row as with a typical
                    vision chart test, as well as separate vison charts with
                    faint (low contrast) letters that simulate vision in low
                    light (dusk or dark).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using DNA from the blood samples of these 835 participants,
                    the researchers identified specific genetic changes in two
                    complement genes, C1QA and CR1, linked to those people with
                    the most rapidly declining ability to distinguish letters
                    with less contrast. Patients with genetic changes in the
                    C1QA gene were 71% more likely to develop difficulty
                    detecting visual contrast, whereas those with genetic
                    changes in the CR1 gene were at 40% increased risk for
                    developing a reduced ability to detect contrast.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These complement genes found to be linked with severity of
                    MS vision loss hold the genetic instructions for making
                    complement proteins.

                    Washington (AFP) - Long time, no speak: NASA has
                    re-established contact with the intrepid Ingenuity Mars
                    Helicopter after more than two months of radio silence, the
                    space agency said Friday
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ingenuity's 52nd flight launched on April 26, but
                    mission controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
                    (JPL) in California lost contact as it descended to the
                    surface following its two minute, 1,191-foot (363-meter)
                    hop...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The loss of communications was expected, because a hill
                    stood between Ingenuity and Perseverance, which acts as a
                    relay between the drone and Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Ingenuity is designed to take care of itself when
                    communication gaps like this occur, but we all still had a
                    sense of relief finally hearing back."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Data so far indicates that the heli is in good shape. If
                    further health checks also come back normal, Ingenuity will
                    be all set for its next flight, westward toward a rocky
                    outcrop the Perseverance team is interested in exploring.

                    A new framework developed by University of Waterloo
                    researchers demonstrates the significant economic health
                    savings and benefits from urban park investments.
                  </p>

                    park, which cost taxpayers $6.4 million, and have estimated
                    the economic value of physical and mental health benefits
                    that could come from it at more than $4 million per year.
                    The framework considers the health savings associated with
                    improved mental health and better air quality, the avoided
                    economic burden of physical inactivity and higher life
                    satisfaction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study demonstrates the value of developing and enhancing
                    urban parks as a strategy to improve population health and
                    well-being, and as a means of cost savings to the medical
                    system.

                    "Investments in urban parks are among the soundest financial
                    decisions a community can make," said Jeffrey Wilson,
                    professor in the School of Environment, Enterprise and
                    Development. "When you consider the population health
                    benefits, the value of lessening climate-related impacts and
                    the role of parks to support economic development, we see
                    how parks provide a large payback."

                    A drone flies over a peaceful Southern California marsh and
                    unleashes a rain of larvae-killing bacterial spore pellets.
                    Its target: a surging population of mosquitoes that can

                  <p>
                    The drone is the latest technology deployed by the Orange
                    County Mosquito and Vector Control District to attack
                    mosquito development in marshes, large ponds and parks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Common methods of applying anti-mosquito treatments
                    involve use of backpack sprayers, trucks, airplanes and
                    helicopters. The drone allows more precise treatments and
                    avoids the need to trample through sensitive lands,
                    according to the district.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The drone is flown higher than all nesting birds and
                    allows access to places that can't be reached by a person
                    with a backpack sprayer or trucks, Nguyen said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nguyen said the drone is able to treat 1 acre (0.4 hectares)
                    of land in under two minutes, a task that would take more
                    than an hour of hiking by a worker with a backpack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The anti-mosquito treatment is not harmful to other
                    wildlife.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The mosquito larvae are filter feeders, so they feed on the
                    bacteria," Savage said. "It enters their gut and it's a
                    growth regulator. So essentially—if you guys have seen the
                    movie 'Alien'—it blows their stomach out."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] So far this year, West Nile has not been detected in
                    the Orange County district but Nguyen is nowhere near
                    declaring victory over the pests.

                  <p>
                    "It's more of a battle," he said. "You're not going to win
                    the war against mosquitoes, but you can gain some ground.
                    And with advancements in technology, we're gaining ground."

                    It's summer, and that means health organizations will be
                    periodically showering Americans with reminders of how
                    public swimming venues are actually nightmarish cesspits
                    teeming with microbes that can burn your eyes, ravage your

                    In attempts to communicate some pretty basic health
                    advice—like, don't pee or poop in a public pool and try to
                    avoid gulping toxic algae from lakes—health organizations
                    create a mesmerizing fountain of hilarious, graphic,
                    disturbing, clumsy, and sometimes perplexing advisories.

                    picks for the top five public health advisories bobbing in

                    If swimming pools suddenly seem too confining and
                    ill-equipped to handle the loaded loads we're plunging,
                    maybe a swim in a nice, big, natural lake sounds nice this
                    summer? Think again.

                    The Wisconsin Department of Health Services wants to ensure
                    you don't swim in any toxin-toting blooms of blue-green
                    algae. In helpful, picture-based tips, the department
                    advises against swimming in water that looks like green pea
                    soup or green latex paint—in case any of those options
                    seemed enticing. Dead fish and "floating scum, globs, or
                    mats" are also (apparently not obvious) signs to stay away.

                    on the AIGameDev subreddit, potterharry97 wrote that the
                    initial submission was intended as an early placeholder
                    version, "with 2-3 assets/sprites that were admittedly
                    obviously AI generated from the hands."<br />[...]<br />These
                    days, the use of AI-generated art can sometimes be easier to
                    catch, as was the case with potterharry97's Stable Diffusion
                    sprites and their telltale hands. But that might get tougher

                Women hunt in vast majority of foraging societies, upending old

                    For decades anthropologists have witnessed forager
                    women—those who live in societies that both hunt and
                    gather—around the world skillfully slay prey: In the 1980s,
                    Agta women of the Philippines drew bows and arrows as tall
                    as themselves and aimed at wild pigs and deer, and Matses
                    Amazonians struck paca rodents with machetes. Observations
                    from the 1990s described Aka great-grandmothers and girls as
                    young as age 5 trapping duiker and porcupine in central
                    Africa.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A study published today in PLOS ONE has united these reports
                    for a first-of-its-kind global view of women hunters.
                    Reviewing accounts penned by scholars who study culture,
                    known as ethnographers, as well as those by observers
                    between the late 1800s and today, the researchers found that
                    women hunted in nearly 80% of surveyed forager societies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These data flatly reject a long-standing myth that men hunt,
                    women gather, and that this division runs deep in human
                    history.

                    He was hit with a "significant sentence," US attorney for
                    the District of Arizona, Gary Restaino, wrote in the
                    sentencing memo, because of the "greed and the great
                    lengths" that Teran's scam went over the course of five
                    years to fraudulently claim rights to 50,000 songs.
                    Ultimately, the scam routed $23 million in royalty proceeds
                    away from mostly Latin artists and into the bank accounts of
                    Teran and his co-conspirators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Teran, the sentencing memo said, "obtained more than $6
                    million in personal profits" and continued pocketing
                    $190,000 in stolen royalties—which he hid from
                    officials—even after he was indicted for the fraud. Partly
                    because of this, Teran is considered a "high-risk to
                    re-offend," Restaino wrote.<br />[...]<br />Artists
                    attempted to bring a class-action lawsuit against YouTube to
                    gain access to systems to monitor their royalties and stop
                    royalty theft, but that case was

                  <p>
                    Teran could attempt to run the scam or something like it
                    again, Restaino wrote. The US government considers Teran at
                    high risk to re-offend, partly because just 12 days after
                    being summoned for his indictment, he promptly created a new
                    bank account to stash additional stolen payments sent from
                    AdRev.

                    From visible starlight to radio waves, the Milky Way galaxy
                    has long been observed through the various frequencies of
                    electromagnetic radiation it emits. Scientists have now
                    revealed a uniquely different image of our galaxy by
                    determining the galactic origin of thousands of neutrinos —
                    invisible "ghost particles" which exist in great quantities
                    but normally pass straight through Earth undetected. The
                    neutrino-based image of the Milky Way is the first of its
                    kind: a galactic portrait made with particles of matter
                    rather than electromagnetic energy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The breakthrough was achieved by a collaboration of
                    researchers using the U.S. National Science
                    Foundation-supported IceCube Neutrino Observatory at NSF's
                    Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica. The immense
                    observatory detects the subtle signs of high-energy
                    neutrinos from space by using thousands of networked sensors
                    buried deep within a cubic kilometer of clear, pristine ice.
                    The results were revealed at an event at Drexel University
                    and published in the journal
                    <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adc9818"

                    [...] "As is so often the case, significant breakthroughs in
                    science are enabled by advances in technology," says Denise
                    Caldwell, director of NSF's Physics Division. "The
                    capabilities provided by the highly sensitive IceCube
                    detector, coupled with new data analysis tools, have given
                    us an entirely new view of our galaxy — one that had only
                    been hinted at before. As these capabilities continue to be
                    refined, we can look forward to watching this picture emerge
                    with ever-increasing resolution, potentially revealing
                    hidden features of our galaxy never before seen by
                    humanity."

                  <p>
                    "What's intriguing is that, unlike the case for light of any
                    wavelength, in neutrinos, the universe outshines the nearby
                    sources in our own galaxy," says Francis Halzen, a physicist
                    at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and principal
                    investigator at IceCube.

                  <p>
                    [...] Over many decades, scientists have revealed countless
                    astronomical discoveries by expanding the methods used to
                    observe the universe. Once-revolutionary advances such as
                    radio astronomy and infrared astronomy have been joined by a
                    new class of observational techniques using phenomena such
                    as gravitational waves and now, neutrinos. Kurahashi Neilson
                    says that the neutrino-based image of the Milky Way is yet
                    another step in that lineage of discovery. She predicts
                    neutrino astronomy will be honed like the methods that
                    preceded it, until it too can reveal previously unknown
                    aspects of the universe.

                    "This is why we do what we do," she says. "To see something
                    nobody has ever seen, and to understand things we haven't
                    understood."

                    The Federal Trade Commission is preparing to file a major

                    continue manufacturing ever-smaller transistors. Intel,
                    America's biggest chipmaker, led the early investments into
                    extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, using a type of light
                    with a wavelength of 13.5 nanometers. This was sufficiently
                    exact to pattern shapes with roughly equivalent dimensions.
                    But only one of the world's remaining lithography companies,
                    ASML, had the guts to bet its future on the technology,
                    which would take three decades and billions of dollars to
                    develop. For a long time, many industry experts thought it
                    would never work.

                    Producing EUV light at sufficient scale is one of the most
                    complex engineering challenges in human history. ASML's
                    approach requires taking a ball of tin 30 microns wide and
                    pulverizing it twice with an ultra-high-powered carbon
                    dioxide laser. This explodes the tin ball into a plasma with
                    a temperature of several hundred thousand degrees. The
                    plasma emits EUV light, which then must be collected with
                    the flattest mirrors ever created, each made of dozens of
                    alternating, nanometers-thick layers of silicon and
                    molybdenum. These mirrors are held almost perfectly still by
                    a set of actuators and sensors that, their manufacturer
                    says, are so precise they could be used to direct a laser to

                    [...] The fact that the computing capabilities of the
                    world's second-largest economy depend on access to a single
                    tool produced by a single company illustrates the central
                    role lithography plays in the world's tech sector. The
                    industry is extraordinarily complex—the result of intensive
                    research efforts by a worldwide network of experts on optics
                    and materials science, plus billions of dollars of
                    investment. China's homegrown lithography tools are several
                    generations behind the cutting edge, lacking many of the key
                    components—like the ultra-flat mirrors—as well as the
                    expertise in systems integration.

                    The lithography process he invented, meanwhile, continues to
                    advance. In several years, ASML will release a new version
                    of its EUV technology, called high-numerical-­aperture EUV,
                    which will allow even more precise lithography. Research
                    into a future tool with even more precision is underway,
                    though it is unclear if it will ever be practically or
                    commercially feasible. We must hope it is, because the
                    future of Moore's Law—and the advances in computing it
                    enables—depend on it.

                    [...] The findings from one of the experiments — which
                    involved several researchers, including Koch and Chalmers —
                    were revealed on Friday at the ASSC meeting. It tested two
                    of the leading hypotheses: integrated information theory
                    (IIT) and global network workspace theory (GNWT). IIT
                    proposes that consciousness is a 'structure' in the brain
                    formed by a specific type of neuronal connectivity that is
                    active for as long as a certain experience, such as looking
                    at an image, is occurring. This structure is thought to be
                    found in the posterior cortex, at the back of the brain.
                    GNWT, by contrast, suggests that consciousness arises when
                    information is broadcast to areas of the brain through an
                    interconnected network. The transmission, according to the
                    theory, happens at the beginning and end of an experience
                    and involves the prefrontal cortex, at the front of the
                    brain.

                    Six independent laboratories conducted the adversarial
                    experiment, following a preregistered protocol and using
                    various complementary methods to measure brain activity. The
                    results — which haven't yet been peer reviewed — didn't
                    perfectly match either of the theories.

                    [...] As for the bet, Koch was reluctant to admit defeat
                    but, the day before the ASSC session, he bought a case of
                    fine Portuguese wine to honour his commitment. Would he
                    consider another wager? "I'd double down," he says.
                    "Twenty-five years from now is realistic, because the
                    techniques are getting better and, you know, I can't wait
                    much longer than 25 years, given my age."

                    With smartphone use rising worldwide, the study identifies a
                    powerful way to reduce screen time: participants who visited
                    nature reserves or forests saw significant declines in
                    screen time over the first three hours, compared to visits
                    to urban locations for the same amount of time.

                    recommended as a way to restore our attention from the
                    demands of daily life, yet before our study, little was
                    known about whether nature provides a way for people to
                    disconnect from the mobile devices that now follow us into
                    the great outdoors," said lead author Kelton Minor at the
                    Data Science Institute, Columbia University. "While past
                    research suggested that short trips to city parks might
                    provide a digital detox, we saw texting and phone calls
                    actually go up. It was really the longer visits to wilder
                    areas, like forests or nature preserves, that helped people
                    get off their screens and wrest back their attention from

                    that urban greenspace may instead be useful in enhancing
                    remote social ties—hence the increase in texts and phone
                    calls in urban parks—but may interrupt the individual's
                    opportunity to utilize the attention-restoring properties of

                    And thus, throwing humility to the wind, I'd like to propose
                    Masnick's Impossibility Theorem, as a sort of play on
                    Arrow's Impossibility Theorem.
                    <b>Content moderation at scale is impossible to do well</b>.
                    More specifically, it will always end up frustrating very
                    large segments of the population and will always fail to
                    accurately represent the "proper" level of moderation of
                    anyone. While I'm not going to go through the process of
                    formalizing the theorem, a la Arrow's, I'll just note a few
                    points on why the argument I'm making is inevitably true.

                Ed. Note: Masnick discusses factors such as user discontent with
                moderation, the subjective nature of moderation, and moderation
                problems at scale. It's well-known that Soylent-style community
                moderation is best-in class, but what about corporate-imposed
                moderation of millions of posts per day, as Masnick discusses?
                Any solutions?

                    Things are not always as they appear: what we see seems like
                    what we have just seen, a new SISSA study says. For example,
                    compared to the actual size, an object might seem bigger if
                    it is preceded by the presentation of a big object, and
                    smaller if preceded by a small one. This visual perceptual
                    bias is thus associated with early visual-evoked brain
                    activity and is driven by a trace of past information kept
                    by neural populations at the very basic levels of visual
                    analysis in the brain. The result of what we see, in short,
                    is a kind of average that the brain makes between what is
                    happening in front of our eyes and what has already
                    happened.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to research authors, Michele Fornaciai,
                    Irene Togoli and Domenica Bueti from Scuola internazionale
                    Superiore di Studi Avanzati (SISSA), this phenomenon is due
                    to the discrepancy between the limited brain computational
                    resources and the plethora of stimuli bombarding our senses.
                    This "bias" reflect the brain's need to find regularities in
                    the external world, making it more predictable and easier to
                    deal with.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] What the scientists observed is that the participants'
                    perception was indeed distorted by past images. The research
                    authors confirm: "A group of objects was judged, for
                    instance, larger or more numerous than it was in reality
                    depending on whether the participant previously saw a large
                    or a more numerous sets of items". Importantly, "the EEG
                    signals revealed that neurons in the visual part of the
                    brain – the "occipital" cortex – kept a trace of the past
                    visual images. And the greater this trace in brain activity
                    was, the stronger the perceptual bias measured in
                    participants".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This research also tells us something more about how
                    our brain works. Domenica Bueti, last author of the
                    research, explains: "We often think that our brain works
                    mirroring reality, but this is not true: on the contrary, it
                    "builds" reality, it is a creator of reality. This is
                    because it receives too many inputs from the external world,
                    and it must find a good method of processing them in an
                    effective way. According to our research, the knowledge of
                    the world influences our perception, from which we can also
                    say that perception is partially based on our expectations.
                    What we have already experienced, in some ways, influences
                    the way we will perceive future events. This is a very
                    stimulating issue, not only a scientific perspective, but
                    also from a philosophical point of view.

                    similar stages, face similar challenges and problems, such
                    as growth hacking and bootstrapping with limited budgets,
                    entering larger markets, leveraging AI capabilities,
                    attracting investments and developing funds, and more. The

                    60,000 criminals via servers in the northern French town of

                    French law enforcement authorities launched investigations

                    [...] All this virtual trainspotting has created unexpected
                    real-world impacts, bringing a much-needed boost of tourism
                    to struggling railroad towns as fans journey to see their
                    favorite locations in person.

                    [...] After a popular stream set up at their local station,
                    more than 500,000 viewers began to tune in each month. That
                    interest has translated to an influx of tourism dollars, as
                    thousands of fans have journeyed to Ashland from locales as
                    far away as the UK and Germany to see the station in person
                    – and, often, wave to their friends on the online stream.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some online fans even plan "cam hopping" vacations, where
                    they aim to stop by as many streams as possible across the
                    US. Abbott said this year's Train Day, an annual celebration
                    of the town's rail history that once hosted just a handful
                    of participants, had brought in upwards of 20,000 real-life
                    visitors.

                    [...] While viewers come for the trains, many stay for the
                    community. Often the bulk of the minutes and hours involved
                    in online trainspotting are spent waiting for locomotives to
                    arrive. In the meantime, people use the accompanying
                    chatrooms to get to know one another.

                    Windows. Those of you with an old Windows 3.1 or Windows 95
                    PC can breathe easy, though, because the same developer who
                    created the Windows 3.1 version of Wordle has returned with

                    An even bigger problem with getting any Internet-connected
                    software running on old 16- and 32-bit versions of Windows
                    in 2023 is that most of the modern web is encrypted, and
                    older operating systems don't support modern SSL/TLS
                    protocols. Many Internet-connected retro projects, including
                    browsers and chat clients, rely on some kind of proxy to get
                    around this, using a modern system to talk to the internet
                    and decrypt data, and passing that decrypted data to the old
                    PC on your local network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To get WinGPT working without a proxy, the Dialup.net
                    developer has also developed a
                    <a href="https://www.dialup.net/wingpt/tls.html"

                    to support TLS 1.2 and 1.3 connections on the ancient
                    operating system. This port is, as the developer says, "not
                    secure, not reliable, and there is no warranty," and it
                    should be used for entertainment purposes only. The port
                    doesn't verify security certificates and uses "a fake random
                    number generator" to function.

                    A team of international scientists has used NASA's James
                    Webb Space Telescope to detect a new carbon compound in
                    space for the first time. Known as methyl cation (pronounced
                    cat-eye-on) (CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>), the molecule is
                    important because it aids the formation of more complex
                    carbon-based molecules. Methyl cation was detected in a
                    young star system, with a

                    Carbon compounds form the foundations of all known life, and
                    as such are particularly interesting to scientists working
                    to understand both how life developed on Earth, and how it
                    could potentially develop elsewhere in our universe. The
                    study of interstellar organic (carbon-containing) chemistry,
                    which Webb is opening in new ways, is an area of keen
                    fascination to many astronomers.

                    Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said: "We are cracking down on

                    in seven women and one in nine men aged between 18 and 34
                    have experienced threats to share intimate images. More than
                    28,000 reports of disclosing private sexual images without
                    consent were recorded by police between April 2015 and

                    the changes were welcome but pointed out there were likely
                    to be "jurisdictional issues". "Some of these websites may
                    not be easily traceable, others may be hosted in countries
                    specifically chosen for their lax laws when it comes to
                    online harm and harassment," he told the BBC. "Very often,
                    victims become aware of images resurfacing months or even
                    years after their apparent takedown."

                    needed to be held more accountable for what was posted on
                    their platforms. "More needs to be done if the Online Safety
                    Bill is to tackle the creation and sharing of child sexual
                    abuse material which takes place on industrial levels," she

                    I still have some floppy drives laying around and I always
                    planned to integrated them into my new SBC projects. In the
                    1990s I had once built a floppy disk controller for an Apple
                    II and also built a SBC around a 65SC816 processor with a
                    floppy disk controller using WD2797 FDC chips. Both worked
                    quite will. FDCs are now obsolete and so I thought about
                    emulating a FDC using a microcontroller. I also could have
                    used new old stock controllers but that was not my
                    intention.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the internet you find several discussions about this
                    topic and in many cases the conclusion was that it is not
                    possible to read floppies without a controller. However
                    there are also some projects describing a floppy disk
                    emulator using a microcontroller with no or only little
                    hardware support. Also there are several projects that read
                    the raw MFM data and send it to a PC to decode the data. I
                    was really tempted to give it a try.

                  <p>
                    My goal was to read and write HD floppies without any
                    additional hardware and be able to read and write the
                    content of individual sectors.

                MIT brain science researchers took a look at comprehension of
                (and preference for) the use of legalese (legal language used in
                contracts and so on) vs. the same thoughts expressed in simple
                sentences. While lawyers did better at understanding their own
                dialect, nearly everyone, lawyer or not, preferred ordinary
                English.

                    Since at least the 1970s, when President Richard Nixon
                    declared that federal regulations should be written in
                    "layman's terms," efforts have been made to try to simplify
                    legal documents. However, another study by Martínez,
                    Mollica, and Gibson, not yet published, suggests that legal
                    language has changed very little since that time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The MIT team began studying the structure and
                    comprehensibility of legal language several years ago, when
                    Martínez, who became interested in the topic as a student at
                    Harvard Law School, joined Gibson's lab as a research
                    assistant and then a PhD student.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a study published last year, Gibson, Martínez, and
                    Mollica used a text analysis tool to compare legal documents
                    to many other types of texts, including newspapers, movie
                    scripts, and academic papers. Among the features identified
                    as more common in legal documents, one stood out as making
                    the texts harder to read: long definitions inserted in the
                    middle of sentences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Linguists have previously shown that this type of structure,
                    known as center-embedding, makes text much more difficult to
                    understand. When the MIT team tested people on their ability
                    to understand and recall the meaning of a legal text, their
                    performance improved significantly when center-embedded
                    structures were replaced with more straightforward
                    sentences, with terms defined separately.

              <p>
                I've had to read my share of contracts and complex NDA/secrecy
                agreements, some of which were pretty sneaky, others very easy
                to follow. In my experience, the long sentence with strings of
                qualifiers in the middle is common, but once you know that is
                the structure it is possible to mentally assemble the start and
                end of the sentence and understand what's being said. Then add
                back in all the conditions where it applies, or does not apply.

                I've been caught out a couple of times to my business and
                financial embarrassment. Once burned I've learned that, when
                there is a lot on the line, reading the fine print is often
                worth the effort. I've also learned that a contract presented to
                me isn't always cast in stone--reasoned objections are often
                negotiable and clauses can be struck or modified. While always
                an option, I resist hiring a lawyer, preferring to work through
                the language myself.

                    A flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long. That
                    was my brief experience with the Pixel Fold, which was a
                    wonderful little device until the display died, along with
                    my hopes and dreams. I barely used it, but it was beautiful.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I didn't do anything to deserve this. The phone sat on my
                    desk while I wrote about it, and I would occasionally stop
                    to poke the screen, take a screenshot, or open and close it.
                    It was never dropped or exposed to a significant amount of
                    grit, nor had it gone through the years of normal wear and
                    tear that phones are expected to survive. This was the
                    lightest possible usage of a phone, and it still broke.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The flexible OLED screen died after four days. The bottom 10
                    pixels of the Pixel Fold went dead first, forming a white
                    line of 100 percent brightness pixels that blazed across the
                    bottom of the screen.<br />[...]<br />Manufacturers keep
                    wanting to brush off the significant durability issues of
                    flexible OLED displays, thinking that if they just shove the
                    devices onto the market, everything will work out. That
                    hasn't been the case, though, and any time you see a
                    foldable phone for sale, you don't have to look far to see
                    reports of dead displays. I'm sure we'll see several reports
                    of broken Pixel Folds once the unit hits the general public.

                Free-software aficionado Ploum has an interesting take on Meta
                and the Fediverse:

                    There are rumours that Meta would become "Fediverse
                    compatible". You could follow people on Instagram from your
                    Mastodon account. I don't know if those rumours have a grain
                    of truth, if it is even possible for Meta to consider it.
                    But there's one thing my own experience with XMPP and OOXML
                    taught me: if Meta joins the Fediverse, Meta will be the
                    only one winning.

                    You've done it. After years of effort and training,
                    sacrifice, and pain, you become an astronaut and have
                    finally set foot on Mars. Time to post your triumph on
                    TikTok for that sweet social media cred. If only you can get
                    a signal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While that might seem like a silly scenario, the need for
                    internet connectivity on Mars is real. It's not just a
                    matter of allowing astronauts to doomscroll and post on
                    Reddit. Landing humans on Mars will require a tremendous
                    amount of data transfer with Earth, which is not easy. So
                    how can we create an information network on Mars that is
                    robust enough for both logistic and personal needs? A paper
                    posted on the <em>arxiv</em> proposes an idea.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] One of these ideas, as the paper outlines, is edge
                    computing. Although you probably don't notice it, edge
                    computing is why you can watch streaming services like
                    Netflix and Disney+. It takes a tremendous amount of
                    bandwidth to stream television and movies, so streaming
                    services distribute their servers to get you better speeds.
                    [...]

                    This latest work looks at what it would take to have an edge
                    computing network around Mars. The key is not only to have
                    data locally accessible, but also to have a certain level of
                    redundancy. So they propose building a constellation of
                    satellites around Mars. Their system would have 9 satellites
                    each in 9 orbital planes, for a total of 81 satellites. As
                    with many constellations, the satellites would communicate
                    with each other to have redundant backups of data. This
                    means various landing sites on Mars would be able to
                    communicate with 2 or 3 satellites at any given time. For
                    extended missions, ground-based servers could be used for
                    even faster data retrieval.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Building such a system would not be cheap, so the authors
                    propose building the constellation in stages. As exploratory
                    missions to Mars lay the groundwork for crewed landing, a
                    few constellation satellites could go along for the ride. By
                    the time long-term stations are being built, the
                    constellation could already be in place.

                    Twitter's move to cut its global workforce from 8,000 to
                    1,500, which included its trust and safety teams. The
                    company also removed its public policy presence in

                    were reinstated to the platform, including 75 that had more
                    than 1 million followers, said Inman Grant. She also pointed
                    to the reinstatement of previously banned accounts that
                    "emboldened extreme polarizers, peddlers of outrage and

                    While Twitter's current terms of use and policies prohibit
                    hateful conduct on the site, the increase in complaints to
                    eSafety and reports of hate content that remained on the
                    platform indicate that Twitter is unlikely to be enforcing
                    its rules, she noted.

                    Citing eSafety's own research, she said almost one in five
                    Australians had experienced some form of online hate.

                    "Twitter appears to have dropped the ball on tackling hate,"
                    Inman Grant said. "We need accountability from these
                    platforms and action to protect their users. You cannot have
                    accountability without transparency and that's what legal
                    notices like this one [issued by eSafety] are designed to
                    achieve."

                    It's currently unclear how many qubits will be required for
                    that in Microsoft's topological qubit architecture, but
                    nowadays, a rate of around two error-correcting qubits is
                    required for each working qubit (the value changes with the
                    tech, as does the qubits' reliability, ease of manufacture,
                    and many other factors).

                    Microsoft is essentially saying that they're as much of a
                    contender in building the world's first quantum
                    supercomputer as other quantum powerhouses. And it's not
                    been an easy road: one of the sub-headings on Microsoft's
                    blog post relating to the announcement reads
                    <em>A high-risk, high-reward approach</em>. And the company
                    is undoubtedly home to some of the most talented quantum
                    researchers the world has seen - that Microsoft reached its
                    breakthrough on topological qubits is testament enough to
                    that. But to be fair, so is IBM; so is

                    [...] The results tell a dynamic story — one rife with rapid
                    diversifications, faltering advances and improbable
                    dispersals. Some groups traveled over impossibly vast
                    distances while others seem to have stayed in one place,
                    remaining stationary while continents, mountains and rivers
                    moved around them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Butterflies first appeared somewhere in Central and western
                    North America. At the time, North America was bisected by an
                    expansive seaway that split the continent in two, while
                    present-day Mexico was joined in a long arc with the United
                    States, Canada and Russia. North and South America hadn't
                    yet joined via the Isthmus of Panama, but butterflies had
                    little difficulty crossing the strait between them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Once butterflies had become established, they quickly
                    diversified alongside their plant hosts. By the time
                    dinosaurs were snuffed out 66 million years ago, nearly all
                    modern butterfly families had arrived on the scene, and each
                    one seems to have had a special affinity for a specific
                    group of plants.

                    "We looked at this association over an evolutionary
                    timescale, and in pretty much every family of butterflies,
                    bean plants came out to be the ancestral hosts," Kawahara
                    said. "This was true in the ancestor of all butterflies as
                    well."

                    - is the first AI model of its kind capable of completing
                    tasks beyond what it was 'specifically trained to
                    accomplish'. Meta claims that Voicebox handily outperforms
                    competing speech-generation AIs in virtually every area.

                  <p>
                    So what exactly is it capable of? Well, for starters, it can
                    spew out reasonably accurate text-to-speech replications of
                    a person's voice using a sample audio file as short as two
                    seconds, a seemingly innocuous ability that holds a huge
                    amount of destructive potential in the wrong hands.

                  <p>
                    [...] Meta clearly believes its new tool is good enough to
                    fool at least the majority of people [since] it's explicitly
                    not releasing Voicebox to the public, but instead publishing

                    and detailing a classifier tool that can identify
                    Voicebox-generated speech from real human speech. Meta
                    describes the classifier as "highly effective" - though
                    notably not perfectly effective.

                    [...] A little caution, patience, and respect for the
                    magnitude of this technology is a welcome sight - although I
                    doubt Meta will sit on Voicebox for <em>too</em> long, since
                    the shareholders will no doubt be wondering how much money
                    it can make them...

                    Artificial intelligence-powered writing assistants that
                    autocomplete sentences or offer "smart replies" not only put
                    words into people's mouths, they also put ideas into their
                    heads, according to new research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Maurice Jakesch, a doctoral student in the field of
                    information science asked more than 1,500 participants to
                    write a paragraph answering the question, "Is social media
                    good for society?" People who used an AI writing assistant
                    that was biased for or against social media were twice as
                    likely to write a paragraph agreeing with the assistant, and
                    significantly more likely to say they held the same opinion,
                    compared with people who wrote without AI's help.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study suggests that the biases baked into AI writing
                    tools – whether intentional or unintentional – could have
                    concerning repercussions for culture and politics,
                    researchers said.

                    "We're rushing to implement these AI models in all walks of
                    life, but we need to better understand the implications,"
                    said co-author

                    "Apart from increasing efficiency and creativity, there
                    could be other consequences for individuals and also for our
                    society – shifts in language and opinions."

                    [...] These technologies deserve more public discussion
                    regarding how they could be misused and how they should be
                    monitored and regulated, the researchers said.

                  <p>
                    "The more powerful these technologies become and the more

                    how we're governing the values, priorities and opinions

                    Since 2012, Kim Dotcom has been fighting extradition to the
                    United States where he faces serious charges related to
                    cloud storage site Megaupload. During that time, very little
                    has been said about Megaupload graphic designer, Julius
                    Bencko. A wanted man in the U.S., Bencko was arrested this
                    month by armed police in the Czech Republic, who filmed the
                    event and published it online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the United States government's superseding
                    indictment dated February 16, 2012, Julius Bencko is
                    described as a citizen and resident of Slovakia. A talented
                    graphic designer, Bencko was responsible for Megaupload's
                    logo and ensuring that other sites in the group looked good
                    and accommodated advertising properly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the United States government, this work earned
                    Bencko more than $1 million in 2010 alone. Even for the guy
                    responsible for integrating Megaupload's Flash player, that
                    was still pretty good money.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The important context here is that Bencko was the director
                    and sole shareholder of Basemax International Limited and
                    through that entity, he effectively held 2.5% of
                    Megaupload's shares. For someone who supposedly played a key
                    role in the most significant piracy conspiracy of all time,
                    the allegations against Bencko were underwhelming and, at
                    times, borderline comical.

                    Minecraft-maker Mojang, which has continued to publish the
                    game on a variety of platforms after becoming part of
                    Microsoft. This is a better analogy for Call of Duty,
                    Microsoft writes, because Minecraft was similarly "an
                    existing, multi-player, cross-platform franchise like
                    COD."<br />[...]<br />Call of Duty is unlike Minecraft, the
                    FTC argues, in part because Minecraft is available in
                    largely the same form on mobile phones, tablets, and the
                    Switch. "Even if Microsoft took Minecraft off of rival
                    consoles and subscription and cloud gaming services, it
                    would still be available for play on many other devices. The
                    context for Call of Duty is very different."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Regardless, the FTC also argues that this manufactured
                    categorization doesn't matter, because Microsoft's
                    exclusivity decision applied to "all future ZeniMax games."

                    For those unfamiliar, Secret Invasion is a Marvel Cinematic
                    Universe (MCU) series featuring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick
                    Fury. The storyline centers on a faction of shapeshifting
                    aliens called "Skrulls" that have infiltrated Earth,
                    prompting Fury and his former Skrull ally, Talos, to
                    respond. The plot explores the tension and distrust caused
                    by the Skrulls' shapeshifting abilities, which raises doubts
                    about everyone's real identities.

                    Because the particles in liquid metal tend to stay so close
                    together, it is difficult to get it to adhere to any surface
                    without something that acts as glue. But these adhesives
                    usually have a negative effect on the metal's properties,
                    such as its
                    <a

                      >conductivity</a
                    >. Yuan and his team wanted a liquid metal that could stick
                    to paper without an adhesive. They used an alloy of bismuth,
                    indium, and tin oxide (BiInSn) and tested how well it
                    performed next to an indium/gallium alloy (eGaIn).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    BiInSn turned out to be more effective. Unlike eGaIn, it
                    doesn't oxidize when exposed to air, so how well it sticks
                    to a surface does not depend on the oxide film that forms on
                    the metal. BiInSn is a solid at room temperature and has a
                    higher melting point, so there is no risk of it liquefying
                    at temperatures under 62° Celsius (about 144° Fahrenheit).
                    It is also capable of stronger adhesion. However, getting
                    optimal adhesion out of BiInSn required trial and error.

                  <p>
                    "We needed to ensure the adhesion of liquid metal to be
                    uniform in large scale on different paper, and to maintain
                    the stability of the coating," Yuan told Ars Technica in an
                    email interview. "To solve these problems, we changed
                    pressure applied on the stamp as well as the rubbing speed
                    used in the experiments and finally found the most suitable
                    parameters, which finally achieved fast, large-scale, and
                    stable adhesion."<br />[...]<br />This substance could

                    Since I discovered Video Chess for the Atari 2600, I found
                    it pretty impressive. However, I believed the game
                    implemented extra RAM memory, but more recently I discovered
                    it worked using only the 128 bytes of memory available, and
                    with a 4K ROM cartridge. That's an impressive achievement
                    for such a small game console, also the rumor of a bug
                    triggered me to reverse engineer this game to see how it
                    works.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Video Chess was developed by Larry Wagner and Bob Whitehead,
                    and released by Atari in 1979. Although the original game is
                    greater than 4K and a bank-switching PCB was created, the
                    final released game was optimized to use only a 4K ROM
                    cartridge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Video Chess also has the distinction of displaying eight
                    different objects on a screen row using a technique known as
                    <em>Venetian Blinds</em>, where the odd row of the screen
                    would show four chesspieces, and the even row of the screen
                    would show other four chesspieces. This technique allows the
                    Atari 2600 to exceed its own limit of 3 figures per screen
                    row. I won't discuss this technique as it is a video display
                    trick, and in this article I'll concentrate in the AI
                    (Artificial Intelligence) code.

                    Back in March, the editor-in-chief of the 25-year-old,

                    in April. The site was the casualty of a round of layoffs at
                    Amazon that will affect a total of about 27,000 employees
                    this year; DPReview was meant to stop publishing new pieces
                    on April 10 and to be available in read-only mode for an
                    undetermined period of time after that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But then, something odd happened: The site simply kept
                    publishing at a fairly regular clip throughout the entire
                    month of April and continuing until now. A no-update update

                      >published in mid-May</a
                    >
                    merely acknowledged that pieces were still going up and that
                    there was "nothing to share," which wasn't much to go on but
                    also didn't make it sound as though the site were in
                    imminent danger of disappearing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yesterday, Everett finally had something to share:

                    This article was originally published primarily as a
                    response to IBM's Red Hat's change to no longer publish
                    complete, corresponding source (CCS) for RHEL and the prior
                    discontinuation of CentOS Linux (which are related events,
                    as described below). We hope that this will serve as a
                    comprehensive document that discusses the history of Red
                    Hat's RHEL business model, the related source code
                    provisioning, and the GPL compliance issues with RHEL.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For approximately twenty years, Red Hat (now a fully owned
                    subsidiary of IBM) has experimented with building a business
                    model for operating system deployment and distribution that
                    looks, feels, and acts like a proprietary one, but
                    nonetheless complies with the GPL and other standard
                    copyleft terms. Software rights activists, including SFC,
                    have spent decades talking to Red Hat and its attorneys
                    about how the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) business model
                    courts disaster and is actively unfriendly to
                    community-oriented Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
                    These pleadings, discussions, and encouragements have, as
                    far as we can tell, been heard and seriously listened to by
                    key members of Red Hat's legal and OSPO departments, and
                    even by key C-level executives, but they have ultimately
                    been rejected and ignored — sometimes even with a "fine,
                    then sue us for GPL violations" attitude. Activists have
                    found this discussion frustrating, but kept the nature and
                    tenure of these discussions as an "open secret" until now
                    because we all had hoped that Red Hat's behavior would
                    improve. Recent events show that the behavior has simply
                    gotten worse, and is likely to get even worse.

                    After Elon Musk recently tweeted that he would be "up for a
                    cage fight" with Zuckerberg, the Meta CEO shot back by

                    itself," Meta spokesperson Iska Saric told me.<br /> <br />After
                    this story was published, Musk responded with two words:
                    "Vegas Octagon." He then tweeted: "I have this great move
                    that I call 'The Walrus,' where I just lie on top of my
                    opponent and do nothing."<br />...<br />In terms of tech
                    billionaire CEOs literally fighting, Musk versus Zuckerberg
                    would be as good as it gets. Musk, 51, has the upper hand on
                    Zuckerberg in terms of sheer physical size, and he has
                    talked about being in "real hard-core street fights" when he
                    was growing up in South Africa. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg, 39,
                    is an aspirational MMA fighter who is already winning
                    Jiu-Jitsu tournaments. He also claims to have recently
                    completed the grueling "Murph Challenge" workout in just
                    under 40 minutes.<br /> <br />Regardless of who would win, I
                    think we can all agree that a Musk-versus-Zuckerberg match
                    would be one of the most entertaining fights of all time. It
                    needs to happen. Don't back down now, Musk.

                 <br />As a tech enthusiast, I'm disappointed the battle will be
                resolved by elbows and fists rather than APIs and technical
                specs.

                    Futures Law, which is suing LexisNexis over allegations it
                    illegally buys and sells personal data. Mao told The
                    Intercept the ICE contract document, which she reviewed for
                    The Intercept, is "an admission and indication that ICE aims

                    no criminal warrant or evidence of probable cause."

                    [...] "Imagine we are making electrical and mechanical
                    spaghetti," Zhao offers. "The electrical spaghetti is the
                    conductive polymer, which can now transmit electricity
                    across the material because it is continuous. And the
                    mechanical spaghetti is the hydrogel, which can transmit
                    mechanical forces and be tough and stretchy because it is
                    also continuous."

                  <p>
                    The researchers then tweaked the recipe to cook the
                    spaghettified gel into an ink, which they fed through a 3D
                    printer, and printed onto films of pure hydrogel, in
                    patterns similar to conventional metal electrodes.

                    electrical interfaces for all kinds of organs," says

                    The researchers then implanted the printed, Jell-O-like
                    electrodes onto the heart, sciatic nerve, and spinal cord of
                    rats. The team tested the electrodes' electrical and
                    mechanical performance in the animals for up to two months
                    and found the devices remained stable throughout, with
                    little inflammation or scarring to the surrounding tissues.
                    The electrodes also were able to relay electrical pulses
                    from the heart to an external monitor, as well as deliver
                    small pulses to the sciatic nerve and spinal cord, which in
                    turn stimulated motor activity in the associated muscles and
                    limbs.

                    We all remember 2020. At the grocery store, toilet paper
                    shelves were empty. Cleaning supplies and disinfectants were
                    treasured finds. Rattled consumers, concerned that they
                    would run out of essential items, swiftly stockpiled
                    products until they disappeared from shelves. In the media,
                    it was referred to as "panic buying."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Disaster-related buying behaviors or DRBBs is a more
                    accurate phrase than panic buying," Holguin-Veras said.
                    "Panic refers to extreme fear that causes someone to act
                    irrationally, which negates the possibility to reason with
                    these individuals to change their purchasing behaviors."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198223000398"
                      >in research recently published</a
                    >, Holguín-Veras and team collected surveys in dozens of
                    countries and found that, in the U.S., the top three themes
                    were: precaution (25.79%), the anticipation of needs
                    (22.63%) to avoid the possibility of regret if they didn't
                    make the purchases (16.39%), and their interpretation of the
                    actions of others, or social cues (13.44%).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found that the key to altering consumer behavior to
                    maintain adequate supply levels is trusted change agents, or
                    TCAs. TCAs refer to the representatives of groups active in
                    disaster perceived to be knowledgeable and trustworthy such
                    as the Red Cross, national/state/local emergency responders,
                    firefighters, and national/state/local health officials,
                    that can reach large numbers of people, understand the need
                    to influence the individuals that enact "panic buying," and
                    are willing to act. A whopping 89% of people said that they
                    would limit their purchases if asked by a TCA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Peoples' objectives in DRBBs ran the gamut. First,
                    self-preservation was a primary concern. Second, altruism
                    factored in as consumers wanted to provide for their loved
                    ones and their communities. Third, opportunism reared its
                    head, as people tried to cash in on opportunities to sell
                    hard-to-find items at a premium. With this in mind, a
                    one-size-fits-all approach will not work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Managing DRBBs requires effective
                    public-private-humanitarian collaboration," said
                    Holguin-Veras. "The public sector has the legal authority to
                    intervene when needed, the private sector has control over
                    the access and supplies, and the humanitarian sector has the
                    deep community connections."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The sectors must work together in preparation, response, and
                    assessment. Building trust and relationships, monitoring
                    events and identifying situations that could prompt DRBBs,
                    and examining legal frameworks are priorities during the
                    preparation phase. During response, demand should be managed
                    by working with private- and humanitarian- sector
                    representatives, TCAs should be engaged, opportunistic
                    purchases should be controlled to foster equitable access,
                    and rationing should be instituted if needed. Appeals for
                    the donations of stockpiled supplies are another measure
                    that can be taken. Finally, a comprehensive assessment would
                    facilitate any needed improvements.

                    Sometimes life's most meaningful relationships grow from the
                    briefest of connections. Like when you go to a party and
                    meet someone wearing your favorite band's T-shirt, or who
                    laughs at the same jokes as you, or who grabs that unpopular
                    snack you alone (or so you thought) love. One small, shared
                    interest sparks a conversation—<em
                      >that's my favorite, too!</em
                    >—and blossoms into lasting affection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is called the similarity-attraction effect: we
                    generally like people who are like us. Now, new findings
                    from a Boston University researcher have uncovered one
                    reason why.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a series of studies, Charles Chu, a
                    <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/charles-chu/"
                      >BU Questrom School of Business assistant professor of
                      management and organizations</a
                    >, tested the conditions that shape whether we feel
                    attracted to—or turned off by—each other. He found one
                    crucial factor was what psychologists call self-essentialist
                    reasoning, where people imagine they have some deep inner
                    core or essence that shapes who they are. Chu discovered
                    that when someone believes an essence drives their
                    interests, likes, and dislikes, they assume it's the same
                    for others, too; if they find someone with one matching
                    interest, they reason that person will share their broader
                    worldview. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But Chu's research suggests this rush to embrace an
                    indefinable, fundamental similarity with someone because of
                    one or two shared interests may be based on flawed
                    thinking—and that it could restrict who we find a connection
                    with. Working alongside the pull of the
                    similarity-attraction effect is a countering push: we
                    dislike those who we don't think are like us, often because
                    of one small thing—they like <em>that</em> politician, or
                    band, or book, or TV show we loathe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are all so complex," says Chu. "But we only have full
                    insight into our <em>own</em> thoughts and feelings, and the
                    minds of others are often a mystery to us. What this work
                    suggests is that we often fill in the blanks of others'
                    minds with our own sense of self and that can sometimes lead
                    us into some unwarranted assumptions."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "When you hear a single fact or opinion being
                    expressed that you either agree or disagree with, it really
                    warrants taking an additional breath and just slowing down,"
                    he says. "Not necessarily taking that single piece of
                    information and extrapolating on it, using this type of
                    thinking to go to the very end, that this person is
                    fundamentally good and like me or fundamentally bad and not
                    like me."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But in a time when political division has invaded just
                    about every sphere of our lives,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/10/05/politics-bias-at-work-survey-shrm/"
                      >including workplaces</a
                    >, the applications of Chu's findings go way beyond
                    corporate horse trading. Managing staff, collaborating on
                    projects, team bonding—all are shaped by the judgments we
                    make about each other. Self-essentialist reasoning may even
                    influence society's distribution of resources, says Chu: who
                    we consider worthy of support, who gets funds and who
                    doesn't, could be driven by "this belief that people's
                    outcomes are caused by something deep inside of them."
                    That's why he advocates pushing pause before judging someone
                    who, at first blush, doesn't seem like you.

                    "There are ways for us to go through life and meet other
                    people, and form impressions of other people, without
                    constantly referencing ourselves," he says. "If we're
                    constantly going around trying to figure out, who's like me,
                    who's not like me?, that's not always the most productive
                    way of trying to form impressions of other people. People
                    are a lot more complex than we give them credit for."

                    An orca repeatedly rammed a yacht in the North Sea off
                    Shetland on Monday, in a concerning development following
                    previous interactions between the cetaceans and vessels in
                    the strait of Gibraltar and Portugal...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Experts believe this could be play among juvenile whales. Dr
                    Alfredo López, of the Grupo de Trabajo Orca Atlántica in
                    Portugal, said: "We know that many boats use fishing lines
                    from the stern to fish and it is a motivation for orcas,
                    they come to examine them." But the focus on boats' rudders
                    may come from adult whales who have developed an aversion
                    towards boats, perhaps because they "had a bad experience
                    and try to stop the boat so as not to repeat it".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most surprising is the fact that this learned behaviour
                    should have appeared nearly 3,000 miles (4,800km) from
                    Gibraltar. Dr Conor Ryan, a scientific adviser to the
                    Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, who has studied orca pods
                    off the Scottish coast, said: "I'd be reluctant to say it
                    cannot be learned from [the southern population]. It's
                    possible that this 'fad' is leapfrogging through the various
                    pods/communities."

                How long before "whale watching" tour boats have to harden their
                propulsion / steering systems to survive Orca attacks?

                    by bad actors, and mass surveillance.

                    [...] To help get this community going, Intel will send
                    Tunnel Falls processors out to a few universities: The
                    Universities of Maryland, Rochester, Wisconsin, and Sandia
                    National Lab will be the first to receive the new chip, and
                    the company is interested in signing up others. The hope is
                    that researchers at these sites will help Intel characterize
                    sources of error and which forms of qubits provide the best
                    performance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using the chip, however, still requires hooking individual
                    chips up to a PCB and getting it down to near absolute zero
                    degrees in a dilution refrigeration system. This may
                    ultimately place a bottleneck on testing, given that Intel
                    can likely manufacture a lot more devices than it can
                    possibly put to use—another reason why shipping them to
                    others makes sense for the company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Overall, Intel has made a daring choice for its
                    quantum strategy. Electron-based qubits have been more
                    difficult to work with than many other technologies because
                    they tend to have shorter life spans before they decohere
                    and lose the information they should be holding. Intel is
                    counting on rapid iteration, a large manufacturing capacity,
                    and a large community to help it figure out how to overcome
                    this. But testing quantum computing chips and understanding
                    why their qubits sometimes go wrong is not an easy process;
                    it requires highly specialized refrigeration hardware that
                    takes roughly a day to get the chips down to a temperature
                    where they can be used.
