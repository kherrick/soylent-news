                  <p>
                    By around 3,000 years ago, visitors at Es Càrritx cave on
                    Menorca — perhaps shamans who performed spiritual and
                    healing rituals — consumed plants containing mind-altering
                    and vision-inducing substances, say archaeologist Elisa
                    Guerra-Doce of the University of Valladolid in Spain and
                    colleagues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Signs of human activity at the cave, including more than 200
                    human graves arrayed in a chamber at the entrance, were
                    previously dated to between around 3,600 and 2,800 years
                    ago. Researchers had also found a hoard of objects in a
                    small pit within an inner cave chamber, including six wooden
                    containers, each containing locks of human hair.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chemical analyses of one container's locks, possibly from
                    more than one person, detected three psychoactive plant
                    substances that had been ingested and absorbed into the hair
                    over nearly a year, the scientists report April 6 in
                    <em>Scientific Reports</em>.

                    Two substances, atropine and scopolamine from nightshade
                    plants, induce disorientation, hallucinations and altered
                    physical sensations. Another, ephedrine, boosts energy and
                    alertness. Shamans would have known how to handle and
                    consume these potentially toxic plants safely, the
                    investigators say.

                    counted. Planetary scientists Rebecca Hahn and Paul Byrne of

                    Such a thorough inventory of volcanism on Venus could offer
                    clues about the planet's interior, such as hot spots of
                    magma production, Byrne says. And with the recent discovery

                    Almost all the volcanoes that Hahn and Byrne found are less
                    than 5 kilometers wide. About 700 are 5 to 100 kilometers
                    across, and about 100 are wider than 100 kilometers. The
                    team also found many tight clusters of small volcanoes
                    called volcanic fields.

                    Sébastien Guillet, an environmental scientist at the
                    University of Geneva in Switzerland, was rocking out to Pink
                    Floyd's classic Dark Side of the Moon album one day when he
                    made a prescient connection. The darkest lunar eclipses all
                    occurred within a year or so of major volcanic eruptions.
                    And astronomers know the exact days of those eclipses. So
                    medieval historical accounts of lunar eclipse sightings
                    should be able to help scientists narrow down the time frame
                    in which major eruptions occurred during the High Medieval
                    period spanning 1100 to 1300 CE. Guillet collaborated with
                    several other scientists to conduct such a study, combining
                    textual analysis with tree ring and ice core data. They
                    described their findings in a
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05751-z"

                    "Climate scientists usually identify past volcanic eruptions
                    by measuring the acidity and amount of volcanic ash in cores
                    drilled from polar ice, or by inferring abrupt temperature
                    changes in tree ring records," Andrea Seim (University of
                    Freiburg) and Eduardo Zorita (Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon)
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00850-3"
                      >wrote in an accompanying commentary</a
                    >. "However, these sources sometimes disagree, because the
                    location, intensity, and timing of eruptions can produce
                    varying results, as can circulation of the atmosphere.
                    Guillet and colleagues' approach offers an independent—and
                    perhaps even more direct—source of information about the
                    timing of volcanic eruptions, which could resolve some of
                    these disagreements."<br />[...]<br />Guillet's critical
                    insight stems from the impact volcanic eruptions can have on
                    the appearance of a lunar eclipse. If there are a lot of
                    aerosols, the moon will appear dark during the eclipse; if
                    aerosols are scarce, the moon will have a bright reddish
                    appearance. So one should be able to estimate how much
                    volcanic aerosols were in the atmosphere from medieval
                    descriptions of the color and luminosity of the moon during
                    lunar eclipses, and use that information to more accurately
                    date medieval volcanic eruptions.

                It's an interesting combination of science and analysis of

                of the forces acting on the climate in Medieval Europe.

                    The federal government has recently begun addressing these
                    dangers. Lawmakers are introducing bills and spotlighting
                    the issue at hearings, and a presidential directive has
                    spawned a series of reports and reviews. To the people most
                    informed and worried about the chaos that hackers could
                    cause, these developments are long overdue.

                    "Agricultural and food security is the foundation of
                    American security," says US congressman August Pfluger, a
                    Texas Republican who has sponsored a bill on the subject.
                    "Without a stable food supply, society stops functioning."

                    Precision agriculture uses GPS sensors and satellite imagery
                    to determine the right kind of fertilizer for every patch of
                    soil and send instructions directly to tractors that
                    automatically move around and spray the appropriate mixes.
                    If hackers breached these systems, they could poison the
                    crops of every farmer using them. The impact wouldn't be
                    clear until months later, when the crops would begin to grow
                    poorly or fail to grow at all.

                    America's meat supply faces huge risks too. Inside the
                    massive industrial facilities where most chickens are raised
                    and slaughtered, the temperature and humidity are precisely
                    controlled by internet-connected computers. With control of
                    this system, hackers could engineer a catastrophe.

                    can force farmers to sit out planting seasons. Breaches at
                    meat-packing plants can cause destabilizing supply
                    shortages. Tampering at a food processing firm can lead to
                    deadly contamination. Already, ransomware attacks that have
                    forced companies to shut down operations for a week have
                    left schools without milk, juice, and eggs, according to
                    Sachs.

                    "A major disruption in this sector leads to immediate public
                    health and safety issues," says Mark Montgomery, who served

                    Despite being increasingly vulnerable, Sachs says, the food
                    and agriculture sector still "doesn't really understand the
                    threat mindset" as well as higher-profile sectors, like
                    financial services and energy, do.

                    Nodules form naturally over millions of years as trace
                    elements in seawater get deposited onto small objects
                    nestled together on the ocean floor, like bone fragments or
                    shark teeth, and slowly grow. They contain manganese,
                    cobalt, copper, and nickel, which are all used in the
                    lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles today, as
                    well as a bit of iron and titanium and trace amounts of
                    rare-earth metals and lithium.

                  <p>
                    Because of the impressive array of metals they contain, at
                    least one company has likened each nodule to a battery in a
                    rock. That's why over the past decade, companies have begun
                    to explore the possibility of commercial mining operations
                    in the deep sea, mostly in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.

                    octopuses, not to mention all the tiny creatures we haven't
                    discovered yet. Scientists have also raised questions about
                    what will happen when the mining operations kick up
                    sediment: plumes could disturb wildlife or even the natural

                    Governing international waters is a complicated business.
                    For deep-sea mining, there's a UN group in charge, called
                    the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which was founded
                    in 1994 and is based in Jamaica. The ISA has been developing
                    a mining code for commercial operations, but some companies
                    want to get things going already.

                    Chinese company Space Pioneer established a pair of
                    milestones this past Sunday, becoming the first startup to
                    successfully reach orbit on its first attempt, and the first
                    Chinese company to reach orbit with liquid rocket
                    propulsion.

                    Space Pioneer launched its Tianlong-2 from the Jiuquan
                    launch centre in northwest China at 4:48 a.m. ET on April 2,
                    according to

                    The company, officially known as Beijing Tianbing Technology
                    Co., is the first in China to fly a rocket using liquid
                    propellant. Tianlong-2 uses liquid oxygen kerosene rather
                    than solid propellant made from fuel and oxidizer, which
                    allows for more control of the thrust magnitude and is
                    better suited for reusability.

                    [...] The private space venture is getting ready for the
                    launch of Tianlong-3, a larger liquid propellant rocket
                    that's designed with a reusable first stage similar to
                    SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket. The upcoming rocket will be
                    capable of carrying 15 tons of payload to low Earth orbit,
                    and it's hoping to launch up to 60 satellites for China's
                    Guowang LEO communications megaconstellation, according to

                  <p>
                    The researcher estimates that more than 40,000 devices,
                    located in residential and commercial properties, are
                    impacted and more than 20,000 individuals have active Nexx
                    accounts [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Researcher Sam Sabetan found that devices use the same
                    password to communicate with the Nexx cloud. What's more,
                    this password is easily attainable simply by analyzing the
                    firmware shipped with the device or the back-and-forth
                    communication between a device and the Nexx cloud.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Using a universal password for all devices presents a
                    significant vulnerability, as unauthorized users can access
                    the entire ecosystem by obtaining the shared password," the
                    researcher wrote. "In doing so, they could compromise not
                    only the privacy but also the safety of Nexx's customers by
                    controlling their garage doors without their consent."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Sabetan used this password to access the server, he
                    quickly found not only communications between his device and
                    the cloud but communications for other Nexx devices and the
                    cloud. That meant he could sift through the email addresses,
                    last names, first initials, and device IDs of other users to
                    identify customers based on unique information shared in
                    these messages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it gets worse still. Sabetan could copy messages other
                    users issued to open their doors and replay them at
                    will—from anywhere in the world. That meant a simple
                    cut-and-paste operation was enough to control any Nexx
                    device no matter where he or it was located.

                    with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
                    bankruptcy filing follows weeks of bad news for the company,
                    including a pause on all operations, a brief hunt for more
                    money to continue as a going concern, and massive layoffs to
                    try to right-size to the company's actual available budget,
                    which today's news essentially confirms was non-existent.

                    Prior to this fast and furious couple week meltdown, Virgin
                    Orbit had already shown signs that it was essentially on
                    life support: the company's marquee first flight from a<a

                  <p>
                    Virgin Orbit spun out of Virgin Galactic way back in 2017,
                    as the Branson-backed space company divided its efforts into
                    two separate avenues of focus: Galactic would pursue human
                    spaceflight, targeting suborbital trips for scientists and
                    wealth thrill-seekers. That has borne some fruit, but also
                    hasn't yet achieved the scale and cadence of operation that
                    it aspired to have accomplished at this stage. Orbit,
                    meanwhile, aimed at delivering small payloads to low-Earth
                    orbit, using small rockets that launched from the wings of a
                    large carrier ship, a modified 747-400 commercial passenger
                    aircraft.

                    Why Windows 95? Well, support ended for it 20 years ago, so
                    this was essentially an exercise in curiosity from Enderman
                    rather than an attempt to crack more modern versions like

                  <p>
                    As well as that, Windows 95 uses a simpler key validation
                    method than later versions of Microsoft's operating system,
                    meaning the likelihood of success was much higher.

                    few eyebrows, it would be much harder to pull off for more
                    recent Windows versions given the increased complexity of
                    their keys. Still, it's an indication of just what ChatGPT

                    I'll also explain the memory read and write
                    micro-operations. A memory operation uses two internal
                    registers: IND (Indirect) holds the memory address, while
                    OPR (Operand) holds the word that is read or written. A
                    typical memory micro-instruction for a read is R DS,BL. This
                    causes the Bus Interface Unit to compute the memory address
                    by adding the Data Segment (DS) to the IND register and then
                    perform the read. The Bus Interface Unit determines if the
                    instruction is performing a byte operation or a word
                    operation and reads a byte or word as appropriate, going
                    through the necessary bus cycles. The BL option3 causes the
                    Bus Interface Unit to update the IND register as
                    appropriate,3 incrementing or decrementing it by 1 or 2
                    depending on the Direction Flag and the size of the access
                    (byte or word). All of this complexity happens in the
                    hardware of the Bus Interface Unit and is invisible to the
                    microcode. The tradeoff is that this simplifies the
                    microcode but makes the chip's hardware considerably more
                    complicated.

                    Scientists noticed strong radio waves coming from the star
                    YZ Ceti and the rocky exoplanet that orbits it, called YZ
                    Ceti b, during observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very
                    Large Array of telescopes in New Mexico. The researchers
                    believe the radio signal was created by interactions between
                    the planet's magnetic field and the star.

                  <p>
                    [...] "We saw the initial burst and it looked beautiful,"
                    said lead study author Sebastian Pineda, a research
                    astrophysicist at the University of Colorado Boulder, in a
                    statement. "When we saw it again, it was very indicative
                    that, OK, maybe we really have something here."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] YZ Ceti b only takes two Earth days to complete a
                    single orbit around its star. Meanwhile, the shortest orbit
                    in our solar system is the planet Mercury, which takes 88
                    Earth days to complete a lap around the sun.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While YZ Ceti b whips around its star, plasma from the star
                    collides with the planet's magnetic field, bounces off and
                    interacts with the star's magnetic field. All of these
                    energetic reactions create and release strong radio waves
                    that can be detected on Earth.

                    Health investigators had linked the drops to cases of an
                    extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain
                    that had never been seen before in the US. The strain is
                    identified as VIM-GES-CRPA, which stands for a
                    carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) with Verona
                    integron-mediated metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) and Guiana
                    extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (GES). Although affected
                    people reported using multiple brands of eye drops, EzriCare
                    was the most common. Additionally, testing by the Centers
                    for Disease Control and Prevention and independent
                    researchers have identified the outbreak strain in opened
                    bottles of EzriCare artificial tears.

                    As of March 14, 68 people in 16 states have been infected
                    with the strain, the Centers for Disease Control and
                    Prevention reports. Three people have died from the

                    a working concept of a new storage architecture called
                    Hepta-level cell NAND flash. This new type of NAND can house
                    up to 7 bits per cell, giving it nearly twice the storage
                    capacity of QLC NAND flash. If Kioxia can stabilize this
                    storage architecture at room temperature, it might become
                    the ultimate successor to spinning hard drives in consumer
                    and enterprise applications.

                  <p>
                    To create hepta-level NAND flash, Kioxia is using a new
                    design called new silicon process technology to increase
                    cell density, in conjunction with cryogenic cooling. New
                    silicon process technology replaces current poly-silicon
                    materials with a single-crystal silicon that is used in a
                    channel inside a memory cell transistor. This apparently
                    reduces the amount of read noise coming from the NAND flash
                    by up to two-thirds. In other words, new silicon process
                    technology produces clearer read signals for reading data
                    off of the NAND flash, enough so to increase the bits cell
                    capacity to 7.

                    [...] In her latest work, Xu is extending the method beyond
                    glass to ceramics, replacing the silica with substances such
                    as zirconium dioxide and titanium dioxide. Whereas glass is
                    brittle and inert, these compounds open up the possibility
                    of producing "functional" objects, such as materials that
                    are less fragile than glass or that have catalytic
                    properties.

                    The group is also experimenting with a combination of
                    kirigami and 3D printing to make even more complex shapes.
                    "When you fold a piece of paper, the level of complexity is
                    somewhat limited, and 3D printing is kind of slow," Xie
                    says. "So we wanted to see if we could combine these two
                    techniques to take advantage of their attractive attributes.
                    That would give us the freedom to make almost any shaped
                    part."

                    it was evaluating whether Microsoft qualified as a company
                    of "paramount significance." Or put another way, whether
                    it's large enough to pose a threat to companies with fewer
                    resources and therefore warrant closer scrutiny by
                    regulators.

                    The investigation is being conducted under abuse control
                    laws that went into effect in early 2021. These changes
                    granted the agency the authority to prohibit large companies
                    from engaging in certain business practices if it's
                    determined they're likely to harm competition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The agency pointed to the company's expansive
                    portfolio, which spans operating systems, productivity
                    software, cloud services, video games, and social media as
                    examples. "In light of this, there are good reasons to
                    examine whether Microsoft is of paramount significance for
                    competition across markets. Such a finding would allow us to
                    take action at an early stage and prohibit possible
                    anticompetitive practices," Bundeskartellamt President
                    Andreas Mundt said in a

                  <p>
                    There's also the fact that Microsoft isn't the first company
                    to attract the German watchdog's attention. Last year, the
                    agency found with "binding effect" that both

                    were companies of paramount significance and were thus
                    subject to heightened scrutiny. Amazon has found itself in a
                    similar boat, but has appealed its decision. Meanwhile, the
                    Bundeskartellamt says it's nearing completion of an
                    investigation into Apple.

                    In response to the German government's investigation, a

                    Citizens of Paris voted on Sunday to ban e-scooters from the
                    City of Love, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo responded by promising
                    that the fleets of rechargeable rentables would be gone come
                    September.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The outcome was overwhelming, with 89 percent of votes cast
                    in favor of the ban, though only 103,084 of Paris's
                    1,382,322 registered voters participated – around 7.5
                    percent. In a summary of the vote, the Parisian government

                    >
                    that the final decision on the ban fell to city officials,
                    who didn't appear to plan on countermanding the non-binding
                    outcome.

                    [...] Only three companies are currently authorized to
                    operate electric scooter fleets in Paris – Lime, Dott and
                    Tier – which were granted three-year contracts in 2020 after
                    Parisians voiced their dissatisfaction with a

                    in the city. Per Paris's government, the public domain
                    occupancy agreements the three operators have all end on
                    August 31, and it seems Hidalgo doesn't plan to renew them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lime and Tier both told <em>The Register</em> they would be
                    ceasing operations in Paris come September 1, though Tier
                    did note its shared e-bike service would still be available
                    in the city.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Both companies expressed disappointment at the outcome, but
                    pointed to the fact that the low voter turnout meant the
                    results weren't representative of the city's entire
                    population. "With approximately 93 percent of citizens not
                    going to the polls, a large majority of Parisians have shown
                    that e-scooters are not an issue," a Tier spokesperson said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We acknowledge the result of this unprecedented referendum,
                    which was heavily impacted by very restrictive voting
                    methods. This led to an extremely low turnout, heavily
                    skewed towards older age groups, which has widened the gap
                    between pros and cons," said a spokesperson for Lime.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lime's response came from a third-party PR firm who said the
                    statement represented a position "shared by Dott, Lime and
                    Tier and not Lime speaking for the industry."

                    they use up all their allocated vacation days. It might seem
                    strange that someone would refuse to take paid time off that
                    they're owed, but many say they worry about falling behind
                    at work or feel bad about leaving an excessive workload with
                    co-workers. Then there are those who feel they simply don't
                    need the time off – people who really love their jobs,
                    presumably.

                  <p>
                    Another reason is the all-too-familiar fear (and
                    occasionally a justified one) that using up all of one's
                    vacation time could mean losing out on a promotion. Many
                    also believe that if a company is making layoffs, which has
                    become a familiar sight in the tech world these days, bosses
                    are more likely to retain staff who take fewer vacation
                    days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ironically, working from home has also led to people
                    taking fewer vacation days. Common reasons why employees
                    used to take days off work, such as visiting a doctor, can
                    now be done remotely or by leaving the home office for a
                    short while.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "US employees have been conditioned to believe if you aren't
                    at work, you are lazy or at risk of being replaced," said
                    Christy Pruitt-Haynes, global head of talent and performance
                    at workplace consultant firm NeuroLeadership Institute. "We
                    also have been taught that to get more you have to work
                    more, and since we all want more, we tend to prioritize
                    active work over other things in our life."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem is less severe in Europe, where workers usually
                    get more than the 15 - 20 average paid days off that US
                    employees receive - and feel less guilty about using them.

                    [...] The scientists found that there was very little
                    overlap between runners who favored self-expansion and
                    runners who preferred self-suppression modes of escapism.
                    Self-expansion was positively related with wellbeing, while
                    self-suppression was negatively related to wellbeing.
                    Self-suppression and self-expansion were both linked to
                    exercise dependence, but self-suppression was much more
                    strongly linked to it. Neither escapism mode was linked to
                    age, gender, or amount of time a person spent running, but
                    both affected the relationship between wellbeing and
                    exercise dependence. Whether or not a person fulfilled
                    criteria for exercise dependence, a preference for
                    self-expansion would still be linked to a more positive
                    sense of their own wellbeing.

                    necessary to unravel more of the motivational dynamics and
                    outcomes in escapism," said Stenseng. "But these findings
                    may enlighten people in understanding their own motivation,
                    and be used for therapeutical reasons for individuals
                    striving with a maladaptive engagement in their activity."

                    [...] Yandex is just the latest example in the Kremlin's
                    long history of trying to take control of Russia's tech
                    companies, fearing what might result from the population's
                    unfettered access to information online. These efforts date
                    to 2011, when Facebook and Twitter helped spark the largest
                    antigovernment protests in the country since the 1990s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some in the tech industry joined the protests, hoping to
                    help put Russia on a more liberal, democratic path. Igor
                    says he was one of them. But he gave up on protests after a
                    few years. "It felt hopeless," he says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the ensuing years, Russia imposed increasingly
                    restrictive laws, arresting social media users over posts,
                    demanding access to user data, and introducing content
                    filtering. This put pressure on both Western social
                    platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn (which has
                    been blocked in Russia since 2016) and their domestic
                    counterparts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    VKontakte, often described as Russia's Facebook, was "de
                    facto nationalized" after its founder, Pavel Durov, was
                    squeezed out of the company in 2014 and Kremlin-aligned
                    oligarchs assumed control, says Enikolopov. After fleeing
                    the country, Durov, who would later go on to create the
                    messaging app Telegram, described Russia as "incompatible
                    with Internet business." According to a study from the
                    National Research University Higher School of Economics,
                    more founders of "unicorn" startups leave Russia than any
                    other country.

                  <p>
                    The Russian government thought it should control everything,
                    says Enikolopov: "Tech companies could not be left alone."

                    FlyHosting first advertised on cybercrime forums in November
                    2022, saying it was a Germany-based hosting firm that was

                    released today by the German Federal Criminal Police Office
                    says they served eight search warrants on March 30, and
                    identified five individuals aged 16-24 suspected of
                    operating "an internet service" since mid-2021. The German
                    authorities did not name the suspects or the Internet
                    service in question.

                    provided by the suspects in particular for so-called 'DDoS

                    data packets via the Internet for the purpose of disrupting

                    DDoS attacks facilitated by the defendants, the websites of
                    various companies as well as those of the Hesse police have
                    been overloaded in several cases since mid-2021, "so that
                    they could only be operated to a limited extent or no longer

                  <p>
                    The statement says police seized mobile phones, laptops,
                    tablets, storage media and handwritten notes from the
                    unnamed defendants, and confiscated servers operated by the

                The Tor Project and Mullvad VPN have both announced
                collaboration on a privacy-oriented web browser. The joint
                browser, which is based on Firefox, has the features of the Tor
                Browser but operates over the Mullvad Virtual Private Network
                rather than Tor's onion routers. The collaboration has helped
                polish interface improvements and address several long standing
                issues.

                    Mullvad and the Tor Project have been part of the same
                    community that is dedicated to developing technology that
                    prioritizes protecting people's right to privacy for many
                    years now. Mullvad contributes to the Tor Project at the
                    highest level of membership, Shallot, and were a founding
                    member of the Tor Project's Membership Program. They
                    approached us to help them develop their browser because
                    they wanted to leverage our expertise to create a product
                    that is built on the same principles and with similar safety
                    levels as the Tor Browser -- but that works independently of
                    the Tor network. The result is the Mullvad Browser, a free,
                    privacy-preserving web browser to challenge the
                    all-too-prevalent business model of exploiting people's data
                    for profit.

                    Researchers using baited camera traps recorded an unknown
                    species of snailfish more than 5 miles (8 kilometers) deep
                    just off the coast of Japan. These are the deepest fish ever

                    A team with the Tokyo University of Marine Science and
                    Technology and the University of Western Australia recently
                    released the footage, which was collected in September 2022
                    in the Izu-Ogasawara Trench, which is just south of Japan.
                    Cameras captured the unknown snailfish that belongs to the
                    genus <em>Pseudoliparis</em> at 8,336 meters (5.1 miles)

                    The expedition was part of a 10-year study into the deepest
                    fish population on the planet. Researchers set out to study
                    the Izu-Ogasaware, Ryukyu, and Japan trenches—all of which
                    are over 7,000 meters (4.3 miles) deep. According to
                    researchers, the recently released images show how different
                    the Pacific Ocean's trenches are to others around the world.
                    Alan Jamieson, a chief scientist in the expedition,
                    explained in the UWA release that, in the Mariana Trench,
                    the deeper researchers look, the less fish there are. But in
                    the trenches around Japan, there are a lot of fish to be
                    found even at extreme depths.

                    The Extended Support Release (ESR) of Firefox will keep
                    supporting Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 until at least until
                    2024. Mozilla programmer Mike Kaply
                    <a

                    >
                    through the Bugzilla platform, stating that the corporation
                    "will not be ending support for Windows 7/Windows 8 before
                    the release of the Firefox 115 ESR," and that the Firefox
                    115 ESR release will support the aged operating systems "at
                    least until 3Q 2024."

                  <p>
                    Mike Kaply also hinted at the fact that Mozilla still has to
                    decide exactly when support for Windows 7/8 will be finally
                    removed. Firefox ESR is stable release of the open-source
                    browser which Mozilla supports for an extended period of
                    time compared to regular, "rapid" releases coming out every
                    month. During its one-year support cycle, each Firefox ESR
                    version only gets incremental updates containing security
                    fixes with no new features or performance enhancements.

                    also reveals that Windows 7 still provides a sizable portion
                    of the overall Firefox userbase (13.44%), while Windows 10
                    is the leading platform with 71% of users. The much-maligned
                    Windows 8.1 is still used by 2.3% of Firefox installations.

                    Earlier this year, when BuzzFeed announced plans to start
                    publishing AI-assisted content, its CEO Jonah Peretti
                    promised the tech would be held to a high standard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I think that there are two paths for AI in digital media,"
                    Peretti
                    <a
                      href="https://view.newsletters.cnn.com/messages/1674787291972586081ce914d/raw"
                      >told CNN</a
                    >. "One path is the obvious path that a lot of people will
                    do — but it's a depressing path — using the technology for
                    cost savings and spamming out a bunch of SEO articles that
                    are lower quality than what a journalist could do, but a
                    tenth of the cost."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Indeed, the first AI content BuzzFeed published — a
                    series of quizzes that turned user input into customized
                    responses — were an interesting experiment, avoiding many of
                    the missteps that other publishers have made with the tech.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It doesn't seem like that commitment to quality has held up,
                    though. This month, we noticed that with none of the fanfare
                    of Peretti's multiple interviews about the quizzes, BuzzFeed
                    quietly started publishing fully AI-generated articles that
                    are produced by non-editorial staff — and they sound a lot
                    like the content mill model that Peretti had promised to
                    avoid.

                  <p>
                    [...] A BuzzFeed spokesperson told us that the AI-generated
                    pieces are part of an "experiment" the company is doing to
                    see how well its AI writing assistance incorporates
                    statements from non-writers.

                    Twitter owner Elon Musk requested a meeting with Federal
                    Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan late last year, but he was
                    rebuffed and told to stop dragging his heels on providing
                    documents and depositions needed for the FTC investigation

                    If you're trying to build a low-end to midrange gaming PC or
                    workstation with inexpensive but modern parts, it has been
                    hard to recommend AMD's Ryzen 7000-series processors. That's
                    partly because Intel's CPUs have offered more cores for
                    similar money, but motherboards with AMD's socket AM5 have
                    remained stubbornly expensive, and their lack of support for
                    DDR4 memory means you'll pay more to get DDR5 RAM.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That may change somewhat thanks to the new entry-level AMD
                    A620 chipset, which the company quietly announced last week.
                    AMD says it should bring the prices of AM5-based
                    motherboards down to around $85, not far north of what
                    low-end Intel-based H610 and B660 motherboards cost, though
                    they'll still require DDR5 (for the DDR5-6000 that AMD
                    recommends for optimal Ryzen performance, the price premium
                    is still not quite double what you'll pay for the same
                    amount of DDR4-3200).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Compared to X670 and B650-based motherboards, A620 chipsets
                    will have more limited connectivity. There's no PCI Express
                    5.0 support at all for either graphics cards or SSDs—not a
                    huge blow since no GPUs and

                      >few SSDs</a
                    >
                    support PCIe 5.0 at this point anyway, but a step back for
                    future-proofing. The processor will still provide enough
                    PCIe 4.0 lanes for a GPU and a single SSD, but the chipset
                    only supports PCIe 3.0 speeds for additional SSDs. The
                    chipset also supports fewer USB ports overall and no 20Gbps
                    USB ports.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps more significantly, A620 chipsets don't support any
                    kind of processor overclocking, nor do they support the
                    Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) or Curve Optimizer features
                    for automated overclocking or undervolting. This is
                    consistent with past AMD A-series chipsets and non-Z-series
                    Intel chipsets, which have also limited their support for
                    overclocking features. AMD says that memory overclocking
                    will still be supported by "most [motherboard] models."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] AMD says that more A620-based boards are coming from
                    the usual suspects—ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, and Biostar
                    are all planning to release a range of A620 motherboard
                    options.

                    Have you ever bitten into a plump, red strawberry, only to
                    find it bland and watery? Certain pesticides might be
                    responsible. A team reporting in ACS' Journal of
                    Agricultural and Food Chemistry has found that two common
                    strawberry fungicides can impact cellular mechanisms,
                    creating berries with subdued flavor and sweetness, as well
                    as a lower nutritional value.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The flavor profile of any produce, including berries, is a
                    result of its taste and smell — sweetness often arises from
                    the amount of dissolved glucose or fructose, and a unique
                    aroma comes from volatile compounds, such as esters and
                    terpenes. In addition, many fruits are also full of
                    nutrients, including vitamin C, folic acid and antioxidants.
                    But because fungicides are designed to disrupt the cellular
                    processes of detrimental fungi, they could accidentally
                    interfere with these processes in crops, inhibiting
                    production of these important flavor and nutritional
                    compounds. So, Jinling Diao and colleagues wanted to
                    investigate how two common pesticides used on strawberries —
                    boscalid (BOS) and difenoconazole (DIF) — affect specific
                    molecular pathways in berries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Looking more closely, the team found that BOS had a
                    direct effect on the regulation of genes involved in
                    cellular pathways related to producing sugars, volatile
                    compounds, nutrients and amino acids. Finally, in a blind
                    taste test, people consistently preferred the untreated
                    strawberries. The researchers say that this work could
                    provide guidance to farmers about the use of pesticides.

              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The researchers found that, despite having the same size and
                color of untreated strawberries, the ones treated with the
                pesticides had lower levels of soluble sugar and nutrients, the
                sugars were converted into acids, and the amounts of volatile
                compounds changed, which subdued the taste and aroma.

                    The AI software Stable Diffusion has a remarkable ability to
                    turn text into images. When I asked the software to draw
                    "Mickey Mouse in front of a McDonald's sign," for example,
                    it generated the picture you see above.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Stable Diffusion can do this because it was trained on
                    hundreds of millions of example images harvested from across
                    the web. Some of these images were in the public domain or
                    had been published under permissive licenses such as
                    Creative Commons. Many others were not—and the world's
                    artists and photographers aren't happy about it.

                    of its own.<br />[...]<br />The plaintiffs in the
                    class-action lawsuit describe Stable Diffusion as a "complex
                    collage tool" that contains "compressed copies" of its
                    training images. If this were true, the case would be a slam
                    dunk for the plaintiffs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But experts say it's not true.
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/eric_wallace_">Erik Wallace</a
                    >, a computer scientist at the University of California,
                    Berkeley, told me in a phone interview that the lawsuit had
                    "technical inaccuracies" and was "stretching the truth a
                    lot." Wallace pointed out that Stable Diffusion is only a
                    few gigabytes in size—far too small to contain compressed
                    copies of all or even very many of its training images.

                    Until Microsoft honors its commitment to remedy these

                    the Kennedy Space Center with a certificate confirming that,
                    at a whopping 6.65 million pounds (3 million kilograms),
                    Crawler Transporter 2 is the world's heaviest self-powered

                    "Anyone with an interest in machinery can appreciate the
                    engineering marvel that is the crawler transporter," Shawn
                    Quinn, program manager of Exploration Ground Systems, said
                    in the statement. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "NASA's crawlers were incredible pieces of machinery when
                    they were designed and built in the 1960s," John Giles,
                    NASA's Crawler Element Operations manager, said in the
                    statement. "And to think of the work they've accomplished
                    for Apollo and shuttle and now Artemis throughout the last
                    six decades makes them even more incredible."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due to how heavy the Crawler Transport is, the vehicle
                    essentially crawls its way to the launch pad. It takes about
                    eight to 12 hours for the rocket-carrying vehicle to drive
                    the 4.2 miles (6.7 kilometers) from the Vehicle Assembly
                    Building to the launch pad, going at a slow and steady speed
                    of one mile per hour (1.6 kilometers per hour). It could
                    take you a shorter time to walk that distance by foot.

                    Is the Google Assistant doomed? The evidence is starting to
                    pile up that the division is going down the tubes. The
                    latest is news from

                    that says the Google Assistant division has been
                    "reshuffled" to "heavily prioritize" Bard over the Google
                    Assistant. It all sounds like the team is being reassigned.

                    We'll get into the report details in a minute, but first a
                    quick recap of the past two years of what the assistant has
                    gone through under Google:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Google Assistant saw eight major speaker/smart display
                      hardware releases in five years from 2016-2021, but the
                      hardware releases seem to have stopped. The last hardware
                      release was in March 2021. That was two full years ago.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      2022 saw Google remove Assistant support from two in-house

                      Google Assistant has never made money. The hardware is
                      sold at cost, it doesn't have ads, and nobody pays a
                      monthly fee to use the Assistant. There's also the
                      significant server cost to process all those voice
                      commands, though some newer devices have moved to
                      on-device processing in a stealthy cost-cutting move. The
                      Assistant's biggest competitor, Amazon Alexa, is in the
                      same boat and loses

                  <p>
                    Each one of those developments could maybe be dismissed
                    individually, but together they start to paint the familiar
                    picture of a looming Google shutdown.

                [...] The bill could have implications not just for social
                networks, but potentially security tools such as virtual private
                networks (VPNs) that consumers use to encrypt and route their
                traffic, one said. Although the intention of the bill is to
                target apps or services that pose a threat to national security,
                these critics worry it may have much wider implications for the
                First Amendment.
              </p>
              <p>
                "The RESTRICT Act is a concerning distraction with insanely
                broad language that raises serious human and civil rights
                concerns," Willmary Escoto, U.S. policy analyst for digital
                rights organization Access Now told Motherboard in an emailed
                statement. [...]
              </p>
              <p>
                [...] Under the RESTRICT Act, the Department of Commerce would
                identify information and communications technology products that
                a foreign adversary has any interest in, or poses an
                unacceptable risk to national security, the announcement reads.
                The bill only applies to technology linked to a "foreign
                adversary." Those countries include China (as well as Hong
                Kong); Cuba; Iran; North Korea; Russia, and Venezuela.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bill's language includes vague terms such as "desktop
                applications," "mobile applications," "gaming applications,"
                "payment applications," and "web-based applications." It also
                targets applicable software that has more than 1 million users
                in the U.S.
              </p>
              <p>
                "The RESTRICT Act could lead to apps and other ICT services with
                connections to certain foreign countries being banned in the
                United States. Any bill that would allow the US government to
                ban an online service that facilitates Americans' speech raises
                serious First Amendment concerns," Caitlin Vogus, deputy
                director of the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology's Free
                Expression Project, told Motherboard in an emailed statement.
                "In addition, while bills like the RESTRICT Act may be motivated
                by legitimate privacy concerns, banning ICT services with
                connections to foreign countries would not necessarily help
                protect Americans' privacy. Those countries may still obtain
                data through other means, like by purchasing it from private
                data brokers." [...]

                    At issue is whether Amazon's series of Alexa-powered smart
                    speakers were collecting data on children under the age of
                    13 without parental consent and retaining it even after
                    users attempted to delete it, which children's advocacy
                    organizations asked the FTC look into back in 2019, the

                  <p>
                    Now the FTC is now recommending issuing a complaint that
                    Amazon didn't confirm parental consent before collecting
                    data and that most of the Alexa activities designed for kids
                    didn't have a privacy policy, sources told Bloomberg. The
                    Justice Department could take the next step and file a

                <div>
                  <p>
                    [...] Like the previous major revision,
                    <a
                      href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf"
                      >C11</a
                    >, the latest standard introduces several useful features.
                    The most important, if not the most exciting, make it easier
                    to write safe, correct, and secure code. For example, the
                    new header standardizes checked integer arithmetic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] C23 also adds new features to protect secrets from
                    prying eyes and programmers from themselves. The new
                    memset_explicit() function is for erasing sensitive
                    in-memory data; unlike ordinary memset, it is intended to
                    prevent optimizations from eliding the erasure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In addition to these new correctness and safety aids,
                    C23 provides many new conveniences: Constants true, false,
                    and nullptr are now language keywords; mercifully, they mean
                    what you expect. The new typeof feature makes it easier to
                    harmonize variable declarations. The preprocessor can now
                    #embed arbitrary binary data in source files.
                    Zero-initializing stack-allocated structures and
                    variable-length arrays is a snap with the new standard "={}"
                    syntax.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Sadly, good news isn't the only news about C23. The
                    new standard's nonfeatures, misfeatures, and defeatures are
                    sufficiently numerous and severe that programmers should not
                    "upgrade" without carefully weighing risks against benefits.
                    Older standards such as C99 and C11 weren't perfect, but
                    detailed analysis will sometimes conclude that they are
                    preferable to C23.
                  </p>

                    In other words, the publishing industry's repeated
                    insistence that ebooks must not be shared has spilled over
                    into the world of physical books. To the credit of the
                    authors in this particular case, when they found out about
                    the notice, they explained that it was

                    [...] An important case at the Court of Justice of the
                    European Union, the EU's highest court, ruled that the First

                    >. In the US, the situation is less clear-cut. But for
                    reasons mentioned at the beginning of this post, it is
                    actually in the publisher's interest to encourage the
                    sharing of ebooks, since it represents a powerful marketing
                    approach that will drive new sales. The copyright world's
                    obsessions with control at any cost means that they are
                    failing to enjoy these opportunities, and that authors are
                    losing revenue as a result.

                    That's an incredible data set to work with."

                    The researchers still needed to answer at least one more
                    question: Where were the proto-galaxy's stars headed? The
                    answer came from another type of measurement newly available
                    in the Gaia DR3 release — the speed at which the stars are
                    moving along our line of sight. Knowing this velocity made
                    it possible to uncover each star's orbit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What emerged was a portrait of a halo-shaped proto-galaxy,
                    as anticipated by some theorists. The population of elderly,
                    metal-poor stars orbited in a small, tight sphere with a
                    radius of 9,000 light-years, which the team dubbed the "poor
                    old heart" of the Milky Way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, the findings suggest that the proto-galaxy didn't
                    steal stars from other galaxies. If it had, their stellar
                    orbits would be headed toward regions beyond the Milky Way.

                    An industry shift toward multi-die design could be part of
                    the solution to these challenges. Instead of a single
                    monolithic chip ("system on chip"), multi-die designs
                    consist of a collection of chips (chiplets or dies) linked
                    in a sophisticated package ("systems of chips"), which can
                    include stacking blocks in a 3D configuration for greater
                    density. Multi-die system designs are capable of supporting
                    the rollout of AI/ML at scale, and they can improve silicon
                    yields, reducing waste during chip manufacturing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When it comes to the business use cases for multi-die
                    systems, Patrick Moorhead, founder, CEO, and chief analyst
                    at global technology consulting firm Moor Insights &amp;
                    Strategy, notes that these custom designs may soon be a key
                    differentiator for companies looking to stand out among
                    competitors. "As more people are looking at more custom
                    silicon as a way to differentiate what they bring to the
                    table, that's what businesspeople should be looking at," he
                    says. "Chiplets enable smaller companies with smaller
                    pocketbooks to use semiconductors for unique competitive
                    advantage."

                Hackers have been exploiting a critical vulnerability in a
                popular WordPress plugin called 'Loginizer' that allows them to
                take full control of affected sites. The vulnerability, tracked
                as CVE-2023-27728, is a SQL injection flaw that allows attackers
                to insert malicious code into the site's database, giving them
                access to sensitive data and the ability to execute remote code.
                Loginizer is installed on millions of WordPress sites, and the
                vulnerability affects all versions up to and including 1.6.5.
                The plugin is designed to provide security features such as
                two-factor authentication and brute-force protection.
              </p>
              <p>
                Security researchers have identified multiple hacking groups
                actively exploiting the vulnerability in recent weeks. The
                attackers are scanning the internet for WordPress sites that
                have the vulnerable plugin installed and are using automated
                tools to inject malicious code into the site's database. Once a
                site is compromised, the attackers can use it for various
                malicious purposes, such as stealing user data or distributing
                malware.
              </p>
              <p>
                The plugin's developers have released a patch for the
                vulnerability, and WordPress site owners are advised to update
                their installations immediately. However, given the widespread
                use of the plugin, it is likely that many sites remain
                vulnerable to exploitation. Loginizer is just one of many
                WordPress plugins that have been found to have security flaws in
                recent years, highlighting the importance of regular security
                updates and monitoring for site owners.

                    Before being tapped to lead Crescent, Landon was Lockheed
                    Martin's VP and GM for lunar infrastructure services. Being

                    time. We asked Lockheed Martin if it or Crescent had been in
                    talks with NASA to make a parsec into more than just a
                    measure of space smuggling efficiency, and a Lockheed Martin
                    spokesperson told us the company isn't under contract right

                    We're all familiar with the elements of the periodic table,
                    but have you ever wondered what hydrogen or zinc, for
                    example, might sound like? W. Walker Smith, now a graduate
                    student at Indiana University, combined his twin passions of
                    chemistry and music to create what he calls a new
                    audio-visual instrument to communicate the concepts of
                    chemical spectroscopy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Smith presented his data
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonification"
                      >sonification project</a
                    >—which essentially transforms the visible spectra of the
                    elements of the periodic table into sound—at a meeting of
                    the American Chemical Society being held this week in
                    Indianapolis, Indiana. Smith even featured audio clips of
                    some of the elements, along with "compositions" featuring
                    larger molecules, during a performance of his "The Sound of
                    Molecules" show.

                    built a library of the "sounds" of a top quark jet and the
                    Higgs boson, among others. The project hoped to develop
                    sonification as a technique for analyzing the data from
                    particle collisions so that physicists could "detect"
                    subatomic particles by ear.

                    telecommunications firm Dwango. The three parties, the
                    document said, were in talks to acquire 4chan. In December,

                    When asked about Good Smile's involvement in 4chan last

                    hate speech, it's a move that could hit them particularly
                    hard. But any action against 4chan requires, or is at least
                    enormously helped by, knowing who actually owns and runs the
                    site. Now that 4chan's ownership and funding is in the
                    public record, the temperature may start to increase on
                    Nishimura.

                    "I think Mr. Kawakami's description of Mr. Nishimura is fair
                    and quite accurate," Sei says. "Kawakami described Nishimura
                    as a child who tears the legs off from a bug. And that he
                    enjoys that."

                is somewhat comparable to the Cabinet. Headed by the Prime
                Minister and consisting of the heads of the various Ministries
                (Defense, Commerce, Education, Agriculture and Rural Affairs,
                Justice, Civil Affairs, State Security, Public Security and so
                on), it handles the day-to-day running of the country while

              <p>
                Its operational procedures are described in a document,
                conveniently titled "Working Procedures for the State Council".
                On March 18, an updated version of that document was published,

                  situations"</i

                to the Central Committee <i>"in a timely manner."</i> Previous

                <i
                  >"administration according to law, seeking truth from facts,

                  actions"</i
                >, or to <i>"guide and supervise"</i> the bureaucracy. In other
                words, its wings have been seriously clipped.

                Secondly, any and all references to Marxism/Leninism, Mao Zedong
                Thought, the thought of Deng Xiaoping and the ideologies of
                former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao are now
                <i>verboten</i>. Only references to Xi Jinping Thought are
