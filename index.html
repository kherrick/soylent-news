                    While adding a little water is popularly thought to "open
                    up" the flavor of whisky, a Washington State University-led
                    study indicates there's a point at which it becomes too
                    much: about 20%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers chemically analyzed how volatile compounds in a
                    set of 25 whiskies responded to the addition of water,
                    including bourbons, ryes, Irish whiskeys and both single
                    malt and blended Scotches. They also had a trained sensory
                    panel assess six of those whiskies, three Scotches and three
                    bourbons.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Both tests found that adding a little water could change how
                    the whiskies smelled, but after 20%, they may start to have
                    the same aroma. Since smell and taste are often closely
                    linked, this likely affected the spirit's flavor as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Whisky is a mix of compounds that run the scale from
                    hydrophilic to hydrophobic, in other words, ones that are
                    attracted to water and others that are repelled by it. The
                    addition of water sends the whisky's hydrophobic compounds
                    into that headspace and leaves the hydrophilic ones behind,
                    changing the aroma of the liquid.

                    A series of chemical experiments show how solar particles,
                    colliding with gases in Earth's early atmosphere, can form
                    amino acids and carboxylic acids, the basic building blocks
                    of proteins and organic life. The findings were published in
                    the journal
                    <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/13/5/1103">Life</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To understand the origins of life, many scientists try to
                    explain how amino acids, the raw materials from which
                    proteins and all cellular life, were formed. The best-known
                    proposal originated in the late 1800s as scientists
                    speculated that life might have begun in a "warm little
                    pond": A soup of chemicals, energized by lightning, heat,
                    and other energy sources, that could mix together in
                    concentrated amounts to form organic molecules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1953, Stanley Miller of the University of Chicago tried
                    to recreate these primordial conditions in the lab. Miller
                    filled a closed chamber with methane, ammonia, water, and
                    molecular hydrogen – gases thought to be prevalent in
                    Earth's early atmosphere – and repeatedly ignited an
                    electrical spark to simulate lightning. A week later, Miller
                    and his graduate advisor Harold Urey analyzed the chamber's
                    contents and found that 20 different amino acids had formed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But the last 70 years have complicated this
                    interpretation. Scientists now believe ammonia (NH3) and
                    methane (CH4) were far less abundant; instead, Earth's air
                    was filled with carbon dioxide (CO2) and molecular nitrogen
                    (N2), which require more energy to break down. These gases
                    can still yield amino acids, but in greatly reduced
                    quantities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "During cold conditions you never have lightning, and
                    early Earth was under a pretty faint Sun," Airapetian said.
                    "That's not saying that it couldn't have come from
                    lightning, but lightning seems less likely now, and solar
                    particles seems more likely."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These experiments suggest our active young Sun could have
                    catalyzed the precursors of life more easily, and perhaps
                    earlier, than previously assumed.

                    New York has already been suffering subsidence since the end
                    of last ice age. Relieved of the weight of ice sheets, some
                    land on the Eastern Seaboard is expanding, while other parts
                    of the coastal landmass, including the chunk on which New
                    York City lies,
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate1597"
                      >seem to be settling down</a
                    >. "That relaxation causes subsidence," says Tom Parsons, a
                    research geophysicist at the
                    <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc"

                    of the USGS in Moffett Field, California and one of the four
                    authors of the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the enormous weight of the city's built environment
                    worsens this subsidence, Parsons says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And this is a global phenomenon. New York City, says
                    Parsons, "can be seen as a proxy for other coastal cities in
                    the US and the world that have growing populations from
                    people migrating to them, that have associated urbanisation,
                    and that face rising seas".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is a wide range of reasons for why coastal cities are
                    sinking, but the mass of human infrastructure pressing down
                    on the land is playing a role. The scale of this
                    infrastructure is vast: in 2020

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Can anything be done to halt these cities – which
                    between them have hundreds of millions of residents – from
                    sinking into the sea?

                    Recent advancements in the field of electronics have enabled
                    the creation of smaller and increasingly sophisticated
                    devices, including wearable technologies, biosensors,
                    medical implants, and soft robots. Most of these
                    technologies are based on stretchy materials with electronic
                    properties.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While material scientists have already introduced a wide
                    range of flexible materials that could be used to create
                    electronics, many of these materials are fragile and can be
                    easily damaged. As damage to materials can result in their
                    failure, while also compromising the overall functioning of
                    the system they are integrated in, several existing soft and
                    conductive materials can end up being unreliable and
                    unsuitable for large-scale implementations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at Harbin University of Science and Technology
                    in China recently developed a new conductive and
                    self-healing hydrogel that could be used to create flexible
                    sensors for wearables, robots or other devices. This
                    material and its composition was outlined in the
                    <i>Journal of Science: Advanced Materials and Devices</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the future, the hydrogel created by this team of
                    researchers could be used to develop a wide range of other
                    sensors and wearable electronics, such as sensors that can
                    detect human motion or medical devices that monitor specific
                    biological signals. In addition, their work could pave the
                    way for the development of similar flexible and conductive
                    hydrogels with self-healing properties.

                    The test correctly revealed two out of every three cancers
                    among 5,000 people who had visited their GP with suspected
                    symptoms, in England or Wales.

                    [...] "The test was 85% accurate in detecting the source of
                    the cancer - and that can be really helpful because so many
                    times it is not immediately obvious when you have got the

                former GM Lordstown OH factory (similar to Tesla, which took
                over the former GM/Toyota NUMMI plant). Their initial product is
                a slick looking pickup truck.

                However, as production has started, the EPA has done their
                official testing and:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    The most notable number is the total estimated range: 174
                    miles. That puts it way at the bottom of the range scale,
                    with more in common with the baffling Mazda MX-30 (rated at
                    100 miles) than the least-legged versions of EV pickup
                    trucks, like the F-150 Lightning, that can manage 230 miles
                    per the EPA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And it's not a problem of overall battery capacity, either.
                    The Endurance has a full 109 kWh of juice onboard. So the
                    issue likely comes down to the Endurance's lackluster
                    efficiency. Indeed, the mpge numbers tell the tale: 48 mpg
                    combined, 49 city, and 46 highway. Whatever criticism you
                    want to level at the EPA's testing regimen, comparing EPA
                    numbers to numbers at least gives a sense of the relative
                    efficiency of a vehicle (if not real-world figures). And by
                    this measure, the EPA's least efficient pickup (the standard
                    battery F-150 Lightning) manages 68 combined, 76 city, and
                    61 highway mpge—a significant difference.

                It seems that designing an efficient BEV takes more system
                engineering than just some fancy styling.

                    Deep in an open coal mine in southern Greece, researchers
                    have discovered the antiquities-rich country's oldest
                    archaeological site, which dates to 700,000 years ago and is
                    associated with modern humans' hominin ancestors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The find announced Thursday would drag the dawn of Greek
                    archaeology back by as much as a quarter of a million years,
                    although older hominin sites have been discovered elsewhere
                    in Europe. The oldest, in Spain, dates to more than a
                    million years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It was found to contain rough stone tools from the
                    Lower Palaeolithic period—about 3.3 million to 300,000 years
                    ago—and the remains of an extinct species of giant deer,
                    elephants, hippopotamus, rhinoceros and a macaque monkey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The artifacts are "simple tools, like sharp stone
                    flakes, belonging to the Lower Paleolithic stone tool
                    industry," the co-directors said in comments e-mailed to The
                    Associated Press.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They said it's possible the items were produced by Homo
                    antecessor, the hominin species dating from that period in
                    other parts of Europe. Homo antecessor is believed to have
                    been the last common ancestor of modern humans and their
                    extinct Neanderthal cousins, who diverged about 800,000
                    years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "However, we will not be able to be sure until hominin
                    fossil remains are recovered," the project directorss said.
                    "(The site) is the oldest currently known hominin presence
                    in Greece, and it pushes back the known archaeological
                    record in the country by up to 250,000 years."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The area has long been known as a source of fossils,
                    and in ancient times huge prehistoric bones dug up there
                    were linked with the Greek myths of a long-vanished race of
                    giants that fought the gods of Olympus. Some ancient writers
                    cited Megalopolis as the site of a major battle in that
                    supernatural war.

              <p>
                CUPERTINO, California, June 5 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O)
                unveiled an augmented-reality headset called the Apple Vision
                Pro at its annual software developer conference on Monday, its
                first big move into a new product category since the
                introduction of the Apple Watch nine years ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                CEO Tim Cook described it as "spatial computing" with the device
                controlled by your eyes, hands and voice.
              </p>
              <p>
                "It's the first Apple product you look through, not at," Cook
                said.
              </p>
              <p>
                Apple's human interface chief Alan Dye said that users will
                select content inside the goggles with their eyes, tap their
                fingers together to click and gently flick to scroll.
              </p>
              <p>
                The device also has an exterior display that shows the user's
                eyes to people on the outside world. The exterior screen goes
                dark when a user is fully immersed in a virtual world. When a
                person approaches a user who is in full virtual mode, the
                headset will show both the user and the outside person to each
                other. "You're never isolated from people around you," Dye said.
                "You can see them, and they can see you."
              </p>
              <p>
                For work uses, Apple showed how the headset can be used with a
                trackpad and keyboard to work like a traditional computer with
                multiple displays.

                    Inhaling low concentrations of ethanol vapor can disable the
                    influenza A virus in mice, without harmful side effects,
                    says a new study by scientists at the Okinawa Institute of
                    Science and Technology (OIST). The scientists believe it may
                    also treat similar viruses such as the one that causes
                    Covid-19.
                  </p>

                    [...] "Ethanol is an effective disinfectant for body
                    surfaces, so we wanted to know whether ethanol could also be
                    effective inside the body," said Dr. Miho Tamai, a scientist
                    in Prof. Ishikawa's lab.

                    Using a humidifier to produce ethanol vapor in a small
                    container, they found that when mice infected with influenza
                    A inhale the vapor for ten minutes, the virus is
                    inactivated. The study is published in
                    <a

                    Influenza A viruses accumulate in a thin fluid layer
                    covering lung cells that protect the surface of the airway.
                    The scientists think that the ethanol vapor must increase
                    ethanol concentrations in the fluid to 20% to successfully
                    treat the infection. This concentration is not toxic to lung
                    cells the scientists created in the lab to mimic human
                    cells. At body temperature, 20% ethanol can not only
                    inactivate the influenza A virus outside of the cells in one
                    minute, but also stop the virus from replicating inside
                    these cells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Influenza A is a virus that has an outer membrane,
                    called an envelope. "Ethanol vapor may also inactivate other
                    enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2," Prof. Ishikawa said,
                    and so far, all viruses that have caused pandemics have been
                    enveloped. "Once the next pandemic happens, maybe we can
                    quickly apply the ethanol vapor inhalation therapy to
                    prevent or cure the disease," he explained.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers believe that ethanol vapor inhalation
                    treatment has great potential as a versatile and
                    cost-effective new therapy against various respiratory
                    infectious diseases. But Prof. Ishikawa cautioned that
                    people should not try using ethanol as a therapy on their
                    own. "That may lead to serious side-effects or explosion
                    risks," he said. "The efficacy and safety of this new
                    treatment on humans and other mammals should be carefully
                    evaluated in the future."

                    Imagine what an airport terminal would be like for a blind
                    person. Unable to see the signs telling you where to go — a
                    great cavernous space full of rushing strangers.

                    suitcases around you echoing off the floor and walls," says
                    Mick Curran, who has been completely blind since he was 15.

                    In a sign of the times in the high-end SSD space, TeamGroup
                    has developed a high-end liquid cooler just for M.2 SSDs.
                    The T-Force Siren GD120S, an all-in-one closed loop liquid
                    cooler with a fairly large M.2 compatible water block and a
                    120mm radiator. This cooling system will be the company's
                    range-topping cooler for solid-state drives that will
                    guarantee that they are going to hit their maximum
                    performance – by giving them nothing less than an overkill
                    amount of cooling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For reference, the M.2 spec tops out at a sustained power
                    draw of 14.85W (3.3v @ 4.5A), with momentary excursions as
                    high as 25W. So even with a high-end SSD like a
                    current-generation E26-based drive, the actual cooling needs
                    are limited. However in keeping with true PC style,
                    sometimes you just want to go big – and in those cases
                    there's the Siren.

                    [...] Physicists are now working to use a laser to set off
                    the energy transition, going from the low-energy state to
                    the higher-energy isomer, in the next step toward creating a
                    nuclear clock. "It is actually something that we in our lab
                    are trying to do," says physicist Ekkehard Peik of the
                    National Metrology Institute of Germany in Braunschweig, who
                    was not involved with the new research. "That's why we are
                    very excited."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Another bonus of going nuclear: The clocks could be
                    made with nuclei inside a solid material, as opposed to
                    atomic clocks, in which atoms must be suspended inside a
                    vacuum chamber. That means a nuclear clock could be more
                    stable and make measurements more quickly, Kraemer says.

                    the creation of the project. Using this Pi-powered digital
                    camera, TankArchives can capture images while retaining the

                    The camera used in this project, the Argust A, isn't a
                    terribly expensive antique to acquire. TankArchives explains
                    that you can find a working model for around $50. That said,
                    it's still a historical relic and being a re-enactment fan,
                    it's no surprise TankArchives wanted to preserve it as much
                    as possible.

                    can also be used and provides a Pythonic means to interact
                    with the camera. According to TankArchives, capturing images
                    is somewhat slow and the unit takes a minute or so to
                    completely boot. Taking a photo requires a couple of seconds
                    to fully capture.

                  <p>
                    Earlier this year, shortly after the excitement of comet
                    C/2022 E3, astronomers found another icy visitor grazing
                    through their images. This comet, C/2023 A3 (
                    Tsuchinan-Atlas), was discovered independently by ATLAS in
                    South Africa and Tsuchinsan Observatory in China - and given
                    their namesake. But will this one be the great naked-eye
                    comet of the decade we've been waiting for?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Currently , C/2023 A3 is very faint as it flies
                    outside Jupiter's orbit, but the fun will peak next year
                    when it skims closely past the Earth and the Sun. Its
                    perigee, or closest approach to Earth, will occur on October
                    13 placing the comet less than 0.5 Earth-Sun distances (AU)
                    from our planet. Perihelion will occur shortly before, on
                    September 24 , 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Interestingly, both of these points in the comet's orbit
                    will position it between the Earth and Sun. This "forward
                    scattering event" may bolster the comet's brightness. In
                    this case, sunlight coming from behind the comet, according
                    to our perspective on Earth , is scattered off of dust
                    particles in the comet's coma towards our eyes . As a
                    result, the comet could appear brighter than we would
                    expect, but there is a caveat – its sandwiching between the
                    Earth and the Sun means the best viewing will occur during
                    the evening or morning instead of the darkness of night.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All in all, it is still too soon for us to know precisely
                    what C/2023 A3 will do. Astronomers are still unsure of the
                    comet's size, which could determine whether it breaks apart
                    during an outburst of sublimation or stays intact. The type
                    of ices and their distribution in the comet's nucleus can
                    also affect how its brightness will change. However, with
                    the help of Unistellar Citizen Astronomers, these unknowns
                    aren't keeping SETI scientists from trying to predict how
                    C/2023 A3 will act.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As long as it survives its trip around the Sun, comet
                    C/2023 A3 is bound to ignite a spark in the new generations
                    on our planet. Even Graykowski's conservative estimates,
                    shown in yellow, place the peak brightness at -0.1, which is
                    still brighter than all but a handful of stars in the sky.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As C/2023 A3 journeys closer to our corner of the
                    solar system, researchers and citizen scientists will
                    continue to gather data and watch it intently. Through the
                    diligent efforts of astronomers and the power of the SETI
                    Institute/Unistellar Network, we have obtained valuable
                    glimpses into the early stages of this comet's trek across
                    the solar system to inform us about its future. Stay tuned
                    for 2024!

                    "Gigantic, severe fires are becoming the new norm in
                    California due to drought, longer burn seasons and dense
                    forests. But birds do really well in landscapes that are
                    'pyrodiverse' – areas where fire results in uneven patches
                    burned at high, medium, and low severity," Stillman said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Black-backed woodpeckers love pyrodiversity. They prefer to
                    build their nest cavities in newly burned areas after high
                    severity fires. But they also like to be adjacent to areas
                    that burned at low intensity, where their young can hide
                    from predators among living trees that still provide cover.
                    Because of the species' unique habitat associations, they
                    are sensitive to the removal of trees after fire, and forest
                    managers use information on the woodpecker to guide their
                    post-fire planning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After a wildfire, forest managers face difficult decisions
                    about how best to protect and restore the burned areas while
                    balancing the needs of people and wildlife. Sometimes there
                    isn't time to survey wildlife in burned areas, making it
                    hard to choose where to invest in wildlife conservation. To
                    address this need, the researchers developed an online tool
                    to predict the potential abundance of black-backed
                    woodpeckers after fire. Incorporating new information on the
                    value of pyrodiversity made the underlying models more
                    accurate.

                    "The tool we've created uses data from 11 years of surveys
                    to predict where woodpeckers could be found in the greatest
                    numbers using data available within months after a fire
                    burns," Stillman said. "The birds move in to take advantage
                    of a boom in juicy beetle larvae in the burned trees."

                    ash. The trees are black. But as you start walking around,
                    you find that the place is alive. It's not dead, just
                    changed."

              <b>Roadmap Moving Forward</b>
              <p>
                We talked about the state of things to come for over an hour,
                and then I had one on one calls with Matt and kolie. The
                conversation was fairly high-level, and mostly consisted of a
                recap of the last few weeks, current progress, as well as what
                actually rebuilding the site is going to look like. Right now,
                we have a commitment to finishing the infrastructure overhaul,
                and upgrade it as is practical.
              </p>
              <p>
                That would basically bring us to the "ok for now" status quo ...
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the status quo does not address the dwindling signal to
                noise ratios or shrinking community. It does not address the
                lack of moderation or content standards. It does not address our
                problems relating to SEO or anything resembling modern human
                interface guidelines. It also does not resolve the long standing
                problems that lead to here.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also had a fairly long conversation on the circumstances that
                lead to here and how we avoid a repeat of ending back on the
                brink.
              </p>
              <p>
                We still have the question of what we will do in the immediate
                future.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have no illusion that staff are happy to work with me, but I
                am hoping we can at least define some sort of formal truce in
                the name of the future of the site. However, members of the
                staff have been demanding for me to step down and simply get
                out.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have been given the impression that if I was to step down,
                they would simply continue the site as is. I am unaware of any
                defined plan relating to fixing any of the problems plaguing the
                site, both as it is now, and those that have persisted long
                before this point.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have also been given the impression that if I do not simply
                GTFO soon, they're simply going to quit.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's fair and understandable given everything that has
                happened.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, I am not the only stakeholder, as currently, Matt as
                co-owner, and kolie, as an interested outside party who is
                actively helping to fix the site, have both indicated that they
                want me to stay involved at this time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, dealing with the deferred maintenance is going to
                take priority. Given everything, I don't see how I can have a
                revised plan for SoylentNews any earlier than July, and
                realistically I expect it to take longer to have a solid
                agreement hashed out by all stakeholders.
              </p>
              <p>
                The staff should be a part of this discussion. However, at this
                point, they have at this point only made demands, and have made
                no attempts that I am aware of to negotiate anything. Unilateral
                demands is not a negotiation.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is part of a larger problem that, at the end of the day,
                the staff had no true stake if the site succeeded or failed.
                This is compounded by the fact that no one has been willing to
                put themselves forward to join as a member of the board of the
                directors since mrcoolbp disappeared, and since none are
                apparently willing to work with me, the person who is both
                president and 50% owner, well, it leaves us at an impasse.
              </p>
              <p>
                The easiest thing to do is to allow them to present their case
                as to why I shouldn't be involved and show to everyone that they
                can lay out a realistic plan to deal with the issues that have
                long plagued this website. After all, if they're so insistent
                that I shouldn't be involved, then as a matter of due diligence,
                I need them to show a plan that involves fixing the site, and
                actual work being doing towards it.
              </p>
              <p>
                For my part, I will do the same in the form of a new business
                plan for the PBC that will specifically explain why we are
                taking money in, how we will use it, how we are going to deal
                with raising capital in the future, and everything else that is
                involved in keeping SN going for another decade. Such a plan is
                going to require both kolie and I to discuss the specifics of
                what replacing rehash is going to require.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of the day, regardless of who was responsible, SN
                decayed to the point that the database was suffering from
                corrupted tables. That has to be addressed, and ultimately,
                until some else steps up to the plate, and presents a workable
                plan, that falls to me
              </p>
              <p><b>Infrastructure Rebuild</b></p>
              <p>
                Of course, talk is cheap, so here's what I have actually done in
                the last two weeks with help from kolie.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have been making slow but steady progress on this. The plan
                is to convert the entire site to an ansible playbook, which now
                exists. We have successfully started deploying site services on
                a fresh set of Linode accounts. So far, kolie has got the public
                wiki rendering, bringing it from MediaWiki 1.18 to a currently
                supported version.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meanwhile, I've been digging deeper into rehash. In any scenario
                that involves the site continuing, we are going to need to be
                able to deploy code changes. Fortunately, when I did the work to
                get the site running on Apache 2, I left myself a lot of good
                notes on how it all works, as well as the "make
                build-production-environment" target which handles a lot of the
                worst parts of how to deal with the mountain of legacy Perl.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is slowly coming together in building a
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/SoylentNews/rehash/blob/master/Dockerfile"
                  >Dockerfile</a
                >
                that's on the public
                <a href="https://github.com/soylentnews/rehash">rehash repo</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                As of writing, I have gotten it to the point it can successfully
                run the install target. I wrote some rather hacky code that
                handles shoving connection database information into the system
                DBIx::Password module, because that's what rehash requires, and
                I was reminded again why this is the codebase from hell.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have also had a longer discussion towards implementing new
                services like status monitoring. A member of the community
                submitted a long and detailed plan to implement Prometheus for
                service monitoring. We're not quite ready for that, but we also
                need to talk about specifically access to the backend.
              </p>
              <p><b>Infrastructure Access</b></p>
              <p>
                When I formally announced the shutdown for SoylentNews PBC, I
                locked out all shell accounts to the backend as well as limited
                access to the Linode panel. This was done both to protect the
                site and as a matter of liability. When the circumstances
                changed, access to the backend was not restored. Access to
                rehash's administration panel however remained available, which
                is how janirirok and the other editors have been posting
                articles. The #chillax channel remains up, although I'm no
                longer in it.
              </p>
              <p>
                I didn't restore access after the situation changed. There are
                quite a few reasons I could give, but given the sheer amount of
                hostility I have received from certain individual members of the
                staff, I could not and cannot rule out the possibility that
                someone would simply "rm -rf /" the production environment out
                of sheer spite. Also, these machines are going away. There isn't
                going to be shell access beyond this point aside from a control
                node.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now, the current plan is to simply get the site back to
                the level of functionality it had back in November, with as many
                parts of infrastructure being fully up to date as-is possible.
                This includes going through the configs, removing obsolete bits,
                and basically reviewing every aspect of the underlying nuts and
                bolts.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am going to be taking a solid look at getting rehash ported to
                the current versions of Apache 2.4 and mod_perl. It mostly
                depends how much of the stack can be built on mod_perl 2.4
                easily. At least with the site on deployable infrastructure, it
                drastically simplifies what it will take to move forward.
              </p>
              <p><b>Timeline Moving Forward</b></p>
              <p>
                Fixing SN is going to require people to be involved and
                dedicated to rebuilding and essentially relaunching the site as
                well as fixing many of the problems that have led to here.
              </p>
              <p>
                To ask that without providing some sort of compensation is folly
                but without a defined plan, well, we end up in a catch-22
                situation.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, here's what I'm going to do and what I am going to ask of
                anyone who stays involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will have the site migrated to less broken infrastructure by
                the end of June at the latest, and likely well before that
                point.
              </p>
              <p>
                After that migration is complete, kolie and I are going to
                negotiate a contract that will handle either overhauling or
                outright replacement of rehash. This agreement is going to
                define any new functionality that will be built into what will
                essentially be version 2 of this website.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also need to define what specifically is the role of various
                volunteers in the upkeep of this site, as well as defining our
                options in case we ever end in another situation like this five
                or ten years down the road.
              </p>
              <p>
                If there's one thing I have surmised, no one is happy with this
                situation, but a big part of moving forward is having an
                agreement on how it will be maintained and have some flexibility
                going forward.
              </p>
              <p>
                A major point of this is growing SoylentNews's cash flow to the
                point that it can reasonably afford to have at least one paid
                staff member and provide some actual incentives to keep people
                involved in its upkeep and overall maintenance.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have quite a few ideas on how to approach this, but I rather
                have a chance to write them out in-depth and explore them.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of this, I also want to deal with raising the overall
                signal to noise ratio, increasing the number of comments per
                article, and hopefully bringing in new blood to the site. It's
                very hard to have any idea as of the state of the health of the
                community as we don't have any analytics, and have historically
                only ever run PiWik for a short period of time.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think we need to consider doing that again, if only to have an
                idea of where we are in terms of actual readership and
                engagement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, there needs to be a reason why someone might post
                inbound links to SoylentNews, and once someone clicks on them,
                sticks around longer than a few seconds. That also makes finding
                such content easier for both humans and search engines.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are just some ideas off the top of my head. Realistically,
                I'm going to need to sit with a pen and paper, sound out which
                ones are practical with kolie and Matt, and then start taking
                steps to implement them, with whomever is willing to join us
                going forward.

                    the company's policy to have workers return to the office
                    for at least three days a week, telling stories about how
                    the remote work kicked off by the COVID pandemic bought them
                    precious hours at home with their family and saved them from

                    work allowed more families to become one-car households.

                    What would the Earth look like to an alien civilization
                    located light years away? A team of researchers from
                    Mauritius and Manchester University has used crowd-sourced
                    data to simulate radio leakage from mobile towers and
                    predict what an alien civilization might detect from various
                    nearby stars, including Barnard's star, six light years away
                    from Earth. Ramiro Saide, currently an intern at the SETI
                    Institute's Hat Creek Radio Observatory and M.Phils. student
                    at the University of Mauritius, generated models displaying
                    the radio power that these civilizations would receive as
                    the Earth rotates and the towers rise and set. Saide
                    believes that unless an alien civilization is much more
                    advanced than ours, they would have difficulty detecting the
                    current levels of mobile tower radio leakage from Earth.
                    However, the team suggests that some technical civilizations
                    are likely to have much more sensitive receiving systems
                    than we do, and the detectability of our mobile systems will
                    increase substantially as we move to much more powerful
                    broadband systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team is eager to extend their research to include
                    other contributors to the Earth's radio leakage signature.
                    The next step is to include powerful civilian and military
                    radars, new digital broadcast systems, Wi-Fi networks,
                    individual mobile handsets and the swarm of satellite
                    constellations now being launched into low Earth orbit, such
                    as Elon Musk's Starlink system. According to Garrett,
                    "Current estimates suggest we will have more than one
                    hundred thousand satellites in low Earth orbit and beyond
                    before the end of the decade. The Earth is already
                    anomalously bright in the radio part of the spectrum; if the
                    trend continues, we could become readily detectable by any
                    advanced civilization with the right technology."

                    On Call Welcome once again, dear reader, to On Call,
                    <i>The Register</i>'s weekly reader-contributed tales of
                    tortuous tech support traumas and triumphs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as "Leif" who, back
                    in the day, was given quite a challenge: a vendor's European
                    office expanded into an adjacent office building, but the
                    move would take months – and the network in both buildings
                    needed to be connected throughout, and keep working within
                    the buildings they served.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Leif and his fellow techies therefore hatched a plan.
                    The buildings were so close together – with trees between
                    the two facilities – surely it would not be hard to just
                    throw an ethernet cable from one to the other?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While this solution was crude, and risky, two factors made
                    it seem feasible: spring was imminent, and green Ethernet
                    cable was available. Leif and his colleagues thought they
                    could string the cable through the trees, and nature would
                    take its course to provide camouflage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their rickety fix would therefore do the job and nobody
                    outside IT would ever notice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And the plan worked. Long before the leaves fell later
                    in the year, the office move was complete, and the
                    camouflaged cable was coiled and stowed without anyone being
                    the wiser about trees having made the migration possible.

                    With the help of NIRISS, the researchers mapped the
                    temperature gradients on the planet's dayside. They found
                    that the planet is much cooler near the terminator line:
                    about 1,000 degrees cooler than the hottest point of the
                    planet directly facing the star. That shows that winds are
                    unable to spread heat efficiently to the planet's nightside.
                    What's stopping that from happening?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The lack of winds moving the atmosphere around and
                    regulating the temperature is surprising, and atmospheric
                    drag has something to do with it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The brightness map of WASP-18 b shows a lack of east-west
                    winds that is best matched by models with atmospheric drag,"
                    said co-author Ryan Challener, a post-doctoral researcher at
                    the University of Michigan. "One possible explanation is
                    that this planet has a strong magnetic field, which would be
                    an exciting discovery!"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers were also able to measure the
                    atmosphere's temperature at different depths. Temperatures
                    increased with altitude, sometimes by hundreds of degrees.
                    They also found water vapour at different depths.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At 2,700 Celsius, the heat should tear most water molecules
                    apart. The fact that the JWST was able to spot the remaining
                    water speaks to its sensitivity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Because the water features in this spectrum are so subtle,
                    they were difficult to identify in previous observations.
                    That made it really exciting to finally see water features
                    with these JWST observations," said Anjali Piette, a
                    postdoctoral fellow at the Carnegie Institution for Science
                    and one of the authors of the new research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the JWST was able to reveal more about the star than
                    just its temperature gradients and its water content. The
                    researchers found that the atmosphere contains Vanadium
                    Oxide, Titanium Oxide, and Hydride, a negative ion of
                    hydrogen. Together, those chemicals could combine to give
                    the atmosphere its opacity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "By analyzing WASP-18 b's spectrum, we not only learn
                    about the various molecules that can be found in its
                    atmosphere but also about the way it formed. We find from
                    our observations that WASP-18 b's composition is very
                    similar to that of its star, meaning it most likely formed
                    from the leftover gas that was present just after the star
                    was born," Coulombe said. "Those results are very valuable
                    to get a clear picture of how strange planets like WASP-18
                    b, which have no counterpart in our Solar System, come to
                    exist."

                    A woman taking a Memorial Day weekend stroll on a California
                    beach found something unusual sticking out of the sand: a
                    tooth from an ancient mastodon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jennifer Schuh found the foot-long (.30-meter) tooth
                    sticking out of the sand on Friday at the mouth of Aptos
                    Creek on Rio Del Mar State Beach, located off Monterey Bay
                    in Santa Cruz County on California's central coast.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Schuh wasn't sure what she had found. So she snapped
                    some photos and posted them on Facebook, asking for help.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The answer came from Wayne Thompson, paleontology
                    collections advisor for the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural
                    History.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thompson determined that the object was a worn molar from an
                    adult Pacific mastodon, an extinct elephant-like species.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is an extremely important find," Thompson wrote, and
                    he urged Schuh to call him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But when they went back to the beach, the tooth was gone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] On Tuesday, Jim Smith of nearby Aptos called the
                    museum.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I was so excited to get that call," said Liz Broughton, the
                    museum's visitor experience manager. "Jim told us that he
                    had stumbled upon it during one of his regular jogs along
                    the beach, but wasn't sure of what he had found until he saw
                    a picture of the tooth on the news."

                    Instead, NASA should focus on encouraging public collection
                    of data in a more systematic way, and reduce the stigma of
                    reporting UAP: if you see something odd, you're not a loon
                    for letting Uncle Sam know. He even suggested that the
                    agency could develop a mobile app that allows people to
                    submit and share sightings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The current existing data and eyewitness reports alone are
                    insufficient to provide conclusive evidence about the nature
                    and origin of every UAP event," he concluded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "They're often uninformative due to lack of quality control,
                    and data curation. To understand UAP, better targeted data
                    collection, thorough data curation, and robust analyses are
                    needed. Such an approach will help to discern unexplained
                    gap sightings, but even then there's no guarantee that all
                    sightings can be explained."

                    The firm has been tracking Void Rabisu since mid-2022 and
                    believes the gang has added evasion techniques to make it
                    more difficult for security tools to detect the malware. The
                    gang has also used fake websites that appear to promote real
                    or fake software – including ChatGPT, Go To Meeting,
                    AstraChat, KeePass, and Veeam – to entice victims into
                    downloading malicious code.

                    the Ukrainian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA),
                    and Google, "a clear picture emerges of the RomCom
                    backdoor's targets: select Ukrainian targets and allies of
                    Ukraine," the researchers wrote.

                  <p>
                    The report details a February 2023 campaign against targets
                    in Eastern Europe during which miscreants embedded the
                    latest version of RomCom – 3.0 – in an installation package
                    of the AstraChat instant messaging software.

                  <p>
                    While RomCom receives upgrades, its modular architecture
                    remains. Three components - a loader, a network component to
                    communicate with the command-and-control (C2) server, and a
                    worker component that runs the actions on the victim's
                    system - do its dirty work.

                    alignment of the campaigns of threat actors who reside in
                    the same geographic region," the researchers wrote. "This
                    will lead to new challenges for defenders, as attacks can
                    then come from many different angles, and it will be less
                    clear who is the actor responsible for them."

                    Mathematicians from Yorkshire University, the University of
                    Cambridge, the University of Waterloo and the University of
                    Arkansas have one-upped themselves by finding a close
                    relative of "the hat," a unique geometric shape that does
                    not repeat itself when tiled, that is a true chiral
                    aperiodic monotile
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Just three months ago, the same four mathematicians
                    announced what has come to be known in the field as the
                    "einstein" shape—a single shape that could be used for
                    aperiodic tiling all by itself. They called it "the hat."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But others in the field pointed out that the shape
                    described by the team was not, technically, a single
                    aperiodic tile—it and its mirror image are two unique tiles
                    and both are needed to create the shape described by the
                    team. Apparently agreeing with the assessment of their
                    colleagues, the four mathematicians took another look at
                    their shape and found that by slightly modifying it, the
                    need for its mirror would no longer exist and it indeed
                    represented the true einstein shape

                    [...] Unfortunately, while logic circuits continue to shrink
                    with every major step forward in process node technology,
                    analog circuits have barely changed and SRAM is starting to
                    reach a limit too.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While logic still forms the largest portion of the die, the
                    amount of SRAM in today's CPUs and GPUs has significantly
                    grown in recent years. For example, AMD's Vega 20 chip used
                    in its
                    <a

                    graphics card has a combined total of 5 MB of L1 and L2
                    cache. Just two GPU generations later, the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2151-nvidia-ampere-vs-amd-rdna2/"

                    >
                    has over 130 MB of assorted cache – a remarkable 25 times
                    more than Vega 20.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We can expect these levels to continue to increase as new
                    generations of processors are developed, but with memory not
                    scaling down as well as the logic, it will become
                    increasingly less cost-effective to manufacture all of the
                    circuitry on the same process node.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an ideal world, one would design a die where analog
                    sections are fabricated on the largest and cheapest node,
                    SRAM parts on a much smaller one, and logic reserved for the
                    absolute cutting-edge technology. Unfortunately, this is not
                    practically achievable. However, there exists an alternative
                    approach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Back in 1995, Intel launched a successor to its original P5
                    processor, the Pentium II. What set it apart from the usual
                    fare at that time, was that beneath the plastic shield sat a
                    circuit board housing two chips: the main chip, containing
                    all the processing logic and analog systems, and one or two
                    separate SRAM modules serving as Level 2 cache.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Intel manufactured the primary chip, but the cache was
                    sourced from other firms. This would become fairly standard
                    for desktop PCs in the mid-to-late 1990s, until
                    semiconductor fabrication techniques improved to the point
                    where logic, memory, and analog could all be integrated into
                    the same die.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Intel continued to dabble with multiple chips in the
                    same package, it largely stuck with the so-called
                    <em>monolithic</em> approach for processors – i.e., one chip
                    for everything. For most processors, there was no need for
                    more than one die, as manufacturing techniques were
                    proficient (and affordable) enough to keep it
                    straightforward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For a technology vendor, using heterogeneous
                    integration for a niche product is one thing, but employing
                    it for the majority of their portfolio is another. This is
                    precisely what AMD did with its range of processors. In
                    2017, the semiconductor giant
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techspot.com/review/1345-amd-ryzen-7-1800x-1700x/"
                      >released its Zen architecture</a
                    >
                    in the form of the single-die Ryzen desktop CPU. Several
                    months later, two multi-chip product lines, Threadripper and
                    EPYC, debuted, with the latter boasting up to four dies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With the launch of Zen 2 two years later, AMD fully embraced
                    HI, MCM, SiP – call it what you will. They shifted the
                    majority of the analog systems out of the processor and
                    placed them into a separate die. These were manufactured on
                    a simpler, cheaper process node, while a more advanced one
                    was used for the remaining logic and cache.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And so, <em>chiplets</em> became the buzzword of choice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But if this design choice is so advantageous, why
                    isn't Intel doing it? Why aren't we seeing it being used in
                    other processors, like GPUs?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To address the first question, Intel is indeed adopting the
                    full chiplet route, and it's on track to do so with its next
                    consumer CPU architecture, called
                    <a
                      href="https://www.techspot.com/news/95724-intel-wants-achieve-1-trillion-transistors-package-2030.html"
                      >Meteor Lake</a
                    >. Naturally, Intel's approach is somewhat unique, so let's
                    explore how it differs from AMD's approach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using the term <em>tiles</em> instead of chiplets, this
                    generation of processors will split the previously
                    monolithic design into four separate chips:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    High-speed, low-latency connections are present between the
                    SOC and the other three tiles, and all of them are connected
                    to another die, known as an <em>interposer</em>. This
                    interposer delivers power to each chip and contains the
                    traces between them. The interposer and four tiles are then
                    mounted onto an additional board to allow the whole assembly
                    to be packaged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unlike Intel, AMD does not use any special mounting die but
                    has its own unique connection system, known as
                    <a
                      href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/infinity-architecture"
                      >Infinity Fabric</a
                    >, to handle chiplet data transactions. Power delivery runs
                    through a fairly standard package, and AMD also uses fewer
                    chiplets. So why is Intel's design as such?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One challenge with AMD's approach is that it's not very
                    suitable for the ultra-mobile, low-power sector. This is why
                    AMD still uses monolithic CPUs for that segment. Intel's
                    design allows them to mix and match different tiles to fit a
                    specific need. For example, budget models for affordable
                    laptops can use much smaller tiles everywhere, while AMD
                    only has one size chiplet for each purpose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The downside to Intel's system is that it's complex and
                    expensive to produce, although it's too early to predict how
                    this will affect retail prices. Both CPU firms, however, are
                    fully committed to the chiplet concept. Once every part of
                    the manufacturing chain is engineered around it, costs
                    should decrease.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To continue enhancing chip performance, engineers
                    essentially have two avenues – add more logic, with the
                    necessary memory to support it, and increase internal clock
                    speeds. Regarding the latter, the average CPU hasn't
                    significantly altered in this aspect for years.

                    However, what <em>has</em> changed is the amount of
                    circuitry and SRAM. The aforementioned FX-9590 had 8 cores
                    (and 8 threads) and 8 MB of L3 cache, whereas the 7950X3D
                    boasts 16 cores, 32 threads, and 128 MB of L3 cache. Intel's
                    CPUs have similarly expanded in terms of cores and SRAM.

                    Boeing designed the Starliner capsule to float back down to
                    Earth with the help of three parachutes. According to
                    <em>The New York Times</em>, the company discovered that
                    parts of the lines connecting the system to the capsule
                    don't have the ability to tolerate the spacecraft's load in
                    case only two of the three parachutes are deployed
                    correctly. Since the capsule will be carrying human
                    passengers back to our planet, the company has to look at
                    every aspect of its spacecraft to ensure their safety as
                    much as possible. Boeing expects to do another parachute
                    testing before it schedules another launch attempt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to its parachute problem, Boeing is also
                    reassessing the use of a certain tape adhesive to wrap
                    hundreds of feet of wiring. Apparently, the tape could be
                    flammable, so engineers are looking to use another kind of
                    wrapping for areas of the spacecraft with the greatest fire
                    risk.

                    The Crew Flight Test is the last hurdle the company has to
                    overcome to regularly start ferrying astronauts to the ISS.
                    NASA chose Boeing as one of its commercial crew partners

                    it's almost all complete. The combined team is resilient and

                    New houses that rely on dwindling groundwater supplies
                    around one of the United States' biggest cities are to be
                    banned, officials said Thursday, in a sign of the strains
                    that drought and climate change are causing across the US
                    west.

                    Water managers in Arizona say there is a significant
                    shortfall in the Phoenix area, and that any more development
                    in the fast-growing city must rely on other sources of
                    water—such as under-strain rivers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Over a period of 100 years, the Phoenix (area) will
                    experience 4.86 million acre-feet of unmet demand for
                    groundwater supplies," the Arizona Department of Water
                    Resources said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An acre-foot is the amount of water it takes to cover an
                    acre with a foot of water—around 326,000 gallons (1.23
                    million liters)—and is equivalent to around half an
                    Olympic-size swimming pool.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The term 'unmet demand' refers to the amount of groundwater
                    usage that is simulated to remain unfulfilled as a result of
                    wells running dry."

                    The western United States is in the grip of a more-than two-
                    decade drought and a long-term aridification, which
                    scientists say is being exacerbated by human-caused climate
                    change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Major rivers that cross the region, among them the Colorado
                    River, have long been over-exploited, with far more water
                    removed every year than falls as rain or snow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This has led to shrinking reservoirs, including the enormous
                    Lake Mead, which last year dropped to just a quarter of its
                    capacity, threatening "deadpool"—the point where the river
                    downstream dries up and hydroelectric power production
                    ceases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With rivers under pressure, fast-growing population centers
                    have long tapped groundwater to provide water for homes and
                    agriculture, in the form of wells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But this source is easily over-exploited and can in some
                    cases take thousands of years to be replenished.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    State officials said permits already issued for developments
                    in Maricopa County, in which Phoenix sits, will not be
                    rescinded, but developers will have to prove any new
                    applications have a sustainable water source other than
                    groundwater.
                  </p>

                    [...] Scientists say a wet winter in the US West has
                    alleviated some pressure on the system, but this is only a
                    temporary reprieve as human-caused climate change continues
                    to exacerbate a long-term drying trend.

                    A US Air Force colonel "mis-spoke" when describing an
                    experiment in which an AI-enabled drone opted to attack its
                    operator in order to complete its mission, the service has
                    said.

                  <p>
                    Colonel Tucker Hamilton, chief of AI test and operations in
                    the US Air Force, was speaking at a conference organised by
                    the Royal Aeronautical Society.
                  </p>
                  <p>A report about it went viral.</p>
                  <p>The Air Force says no such experiment took place.</p>
                  <p>
                    In his talk, he had described a virtual scenario in which an
                    AI-enabled drone was repeatedly stopped from completing its
                    task of destroying Surface-to-Air Missile sites by its human
                    operator.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said that in the end, despite having been trained not to
                    kill the operator, the drone destroyed the communication
                    tower so that the operator could no longer communicate with
                    it.

                  <p>
                    "We've never run that experiment, nor would we need to in
                    order to realise that this is a plausible outcome," Col
                    Hamilton later clarified in a statement to the Royal
                    Aeronautical Society.

                    [...] During the industry's early years, every self-driving
                    vehicle had a safety driver behind the wheel. If a car
                    encountered a situation it wasn't sure it could negotiate
                    safely, it would signal to the driver to take over.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once cars went fully driverless, this was no longer an
                    option. Instead, when a Waymo or Cruise vehicle encounters a
                    situation it isn't sure how to handle, it will slow down and
                    stop. Sometimes, the situation will resolve itself and the
                    car can move again on its own. Otherwise, the vehicle phones
                    home and asks for remote guidance.

                    both gradually pushed their services into denser and more
                    chaotic areas. Waymo now serves downtown Phoenix. And as
                    we've seen, it serves Sky Train stations near the airport,
                    if not the airport itself.

                    The reason: Projects like Waymo and Cruise are fantastically
                    expensive. GM

                    [...] So far, the strategy of avoiding freeways, downtowns,
                    and airports has made Waymo and Cruise safe but
                    unprofitable. Eventually, I expect their software will
                    improve enough that they can operate in these challenging
                    environments safely and confidently. But there's no
                    guarantee this will happen within the next year or two. So
                    the leaders of these companies may come under pressure to
                    push into these more challenging environments before they're
                    ready.

                  <p>
                    [...] I expect some readers have found this article
                    frustrating because I have barely mentioned Tesla's Full
                    Self Driving software, which Tesla fans view as the industry
                    leader. This is because I view Tesla as operating in a
                    different market from Waymo and Cruise. Tesla is building a
                    driver-assistance system that is designed to be used only
                    with direct human oversight, while Waymo and Cruise are
                    trying to build cars that can drive entirely on their own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I think a big reason Tesla fans have a misperception
                    that FSD is ahead of Waymo and Cruise is that Tesla's FSD
                    operates in more situations, including freeways. But that
                    misunderstands what's going on. Waymo has been testing its
                    technology on freeways for more than a decade; it has just
                    been doing it exclusively with safety drivers. Tesla
                    <em>only</em> tests its vehicles with a driver behind the
                    wheel, so of course FSD is able to go on the freeway, too.
                    But this isn't evidence of Tesla's superior performance on
                    freeways; it just reflects Waymo's more cautious approach
                    and different business model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Tesla also isn't laying the necessary groundwork to
                    operate a driverless taxi service. Taxi companies need to
                    develop relationships with taxi regulators, police and
                    firefighters, and other officials in cities where they
                    operate. They also need teams of drivers and mechanics in
                    each city to respond when a driverless taxi gets stranded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As far as I can tell, Tesla hasn't started doing any of
                    this. And that suggests to me that the company isn't serious
                    about entering the driverless taxi business. Rather, Tesla
                    is building a driver-assistance system similar to (if
                    perhaps more advanced than) those offered by other
                    automakers. There's nothing wrong with that. But it means
                    that Tesla isn't a direct competitor to Waymo and Cruise.

                    Platforms remove graphic videos, often using artificial
                    intelligence - but footage that may help prosecutions can be
                    taken down without being archived. Meta and YouTube say they
                    aim to balance their duties to bear witness and protect
                    users from harmful content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Alan Rusbridger, who sits on Meta's Oversight Board,
                    says the industry has been "overcautious" in its moderation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The platforms say they do have exemptions for graphic
                    material when it is in the public interest - but when the
                    BBC attempted to upload footage documenting attacks on
                    civilians in Ukraine, it was swiftly deleted. Artificial
                    intelligence (AI) can remove harmful and illegal content at
                    scale. When it comes to moderating violent images from wars,
                    however, machines lack the nuance to identify human rights
                    violations.

                    Human rights groups say there is an urgent need for social
                    media companies to prevent this information from vanishing.
                    "You can see why they have developed and train their
                    machines to, the moment they see something that looks
                    difficult or traumatic, to take it down," Mr Rusbridger told
                    the BBC. The Meta Oversight Board that he sits on was set up
                    by Mark Zuckerberg and is known as a kind of independent
                    "supreme court" for the company, which owns Facebook and
                    Instagram.

                    "I think the next question for them is how do we develop the
                    machinery, whether that's human or AI, to then make more
                    reasonable decisions," Mr Rusbridger, a former
                    editor-in-chief of the Guardian, adds.

                    [...] Human rights campaigners say there is an urgent need
                    for a formal system to gather and safely store deleted
                    content. This would include preserving metadata to help
                    verify the content and prove it hasn't been tampered with.

                    Ms Van Schaak, the US Ambassador for Global Criminal

                    information can be preserved for potential future
                    accountability exercises. Social media platforms should be

                    The intention is that Project members will work with
                    existing open source communities on a "robust software
                    ecosystem" to include development tools, virtualization
                    support, language runtimes, Linux distribution integration,
                    and system firmware.

                    RISE Project chair Amber Huffman said interest in the open
                    standard has been increasing. A growing number of chips
                    based on the instruction set have also started to market
                    over the past several years, including some focused on the
                    datacenter, such as those announced by Ventana at the end of
                    last year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, this momentum must be supported by adequate
                    software, providing end users with applications that are
                    reliable and commercial-ready, Huffman said.

                    Hiding malicious programs in a computer's UEFI firmware, the
                    deep-seated code that tells a PC how to load its operating
                    system, has become an insidious trick in the toolkit of
                    stealthy hackers. But when a motherboard manufacturer
                    installs its own hidden backdoor in the firmware of millions
                    of computers—and doesn't even put a proper lock on that
                    hidden back entrance—they're practically doing hackers' work
                    for them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at firmware-focused cybersecurity company
                    Eclypsium revealed today that they've discovered a hidden
                    mechanism in the firmware of motherboards sold by the
                    Taiwanese manufacturer Gigabyte, whose components are
                    commonly used in gaming PCs and other high-performance
                    computers. Whenever a computer with the affected Gigabyte
                    motherboard restarts, Eclypsium found, code within the
                    motherboard's firmware invisibly initiates an updater
                    program that runs on the computer and in turn downloads and
                    executes another piece of software.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Eclypsium says the hidden code is meant to be an
                    innocuous tool to keep the motherboard's firmware updated,
                    researchers found that it's implemented insecurely,
                    potentially allowing the mechanism to be hijacked and used
                    to install malware instead of Gigabyte's intended program.
                    And because the updater program is triggered from the
                    computer's firmware, outside its operating system, it's
                    tough for users to remove or even discover.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If you have one of these machines, you have to worry about
                    the fact that it's basically grabbing something from the
                    Internet and running it without you being involved, and
                    hasn't done any of this securely," says John Loucaides, who
                    leads strategy and research at Eclypsium. "The concept of
                    going underneath the end user and taking over their machine
                    doesn't sit well with most people."

                    researchers say are affected. Loucaides adds that users who
                    want to see which motherboard their computer uses can check
                    by going to "Start" in Windows and then "System

                    The system of methylation includes enzymes which modify
                    another protein by adding a small molecule, in this case a
                    methyl group, and 'tagging' it. The addition of methyl
                    groups can affect how some molecules act in the body and
                    changes to the methylation patterns of genes or proteins can
                    influence a person's risk of developing certain diseases,
                    including cancer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is the space that we've been working in experimentally
                    for a very long time," says Prof. Wilkins. "I set out to
                    characterize this particular type of cell modification
                    [methylation], but with a focus on working inside yeast, as
                    a model organism for human and animal cells."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In any methylation process, there is a connection
                    between two proteins (the enzyme carrying the methyl group
                    and the protein being methylated), that make up the core
                    unit of this system. "So if there was more to be discovered,
                    there's essentially going to be an interaction between these
                    two proteins that we don't know about," says Dr. Hamey.

                    "We were able to use the knowledge of this connection to
                    catalog the existing evidence and determine whether there
                    are more of these connections that remain unknown—and if so,

                    [...] To keep global warming below 1.5 °C over preindustrial
                    levels and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we
                    need to reach net-zero emissions around 2050. If we're going
                    to hit that goal, according to the IEA, annual investment
                    needs to reach $4.5 trillion in 2030—nearly triple current
                    spending.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some technologies are actually in great shape. Solar
                    spending just needs to keep growing as it has been for that
                    sector to keep pace with the 2050 goal. But there needs to
                    be much more spending in other areas, especially
                    technologies like energy storage and transmission lines—that
                    will help balance the grid as more solar and other
                    intermittent renewable power sources come online. There's
                    also a huge geographical imbalance, and poorer countries
                    will need a significant boost to help build up their
                    electrical grids and establish new technologies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Investments are broadly on the right track, and I'm excited
                    to see what next year's report will hold. But there's still
                    definitely a long road ahead and a lot of building left to
                    do.

                    As with conventional plastics, though, bioplastics must
                    still be disposed of correctly. But research has found that
                    the labels and instructions on many biodegradable products
                    are often confusing and misleading. In a

                    This could lead to biodegradable and non-biodegradable
                    plastics being disposed of incorrectly. Plastic that is
                    released into the environment may not decompose, and will
                    instead break down into small pieces of microplastic.

                    As the world uses more biodegradable plastic, we need to
                    make sure this material's environmental footprint is
                    minimized. With that in mind, improving labeling and
                    disposal instructions and improving access to industrial
                    composting could all help.

                    be called dystopian: Officers were directing the crowd,
                    which included parents with children at the school, across
                    the street as the robot rolled through the cluster of

                    If you take someone with intermediate knowledge of computing
                    in the right areas, and ask them how an x86 machine boots,
                    they'll probably start telling you about how the CPU first
                    comes up in real mode and starts executing code from the
                    8086 reset vector of FFFF:FFF0. This understanding of how an
                    x86 machine boots has remained remarkably persistent, as far
                    as I can tell because this basic narrative about the boot
                    process has been handed down from website to website,
                    generation to generation, largely unchanged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's also a pack of lies and hasn't reflected the true
                    nature of the boot process for some time. It's true the 8086
                    reset vector is still used, but only because it's a standard
                    "ABI" for the CPU to transfer control to the BIOS (whether
                    legacy PC BIOS or UEFI BIOS). In reality an awful lot
                    happens before this reset vector starts executing. Aside
                    from people having vaguely heard about the Intel Management
                    Engine, this modern reality of the boot process remains
                    largely unknown. It doesn't help that neither Intel nor AMD
                    have really gone out of their way to actually document what
                    the modern boot process looks like, and large parts of this
                    process are handled by vendor-supplied mystery firmware
                    blobs, which may as well be boxes with "???" written in
                    them. Mainly we have the substantial assistance of assorted
                    reverse engineers and security researchers to thank for the
                    fact that we even have a decent picture of what the modoern
                    x86 boot process actually looks like for both Intel and AMD.
                    I could write a whole article about that process — but
                    instead, I'd like to focus on something else.

                    "When two black holes merge to produce a bigger black hole,
                    the final black hole rings like a bell," explains Yanbei
                    Chen (Ph.D. '03), a professor of physics at Caltech and a
                    co-author of both studies. "The quality of the ringing, or
                    its timbre, may be different from the predictions of general
                    relativity if certain theories of quantum gravity are
                    correct. Our methods are designed to look for differences in
                    the quality of this ringdown phase, such as the harmonics
                    and overtones, for example."

                    The first paper, led by Caltech graduate student Dongjun Li,
                    reports a new single equation to describe how black holes
                    would ring within the framework of certain quantum gravity
                    theories, or in what scientists refer to as the
                    beyond-general-relativity regime.

                    <i>Physical Review Letters</i>, led by Caltech graduate
                    student Sizheng Ma, describes a new way to apply Li's
                    equation to actual data acquired by LIGO and its partners in
                    their next observational run. This data analysis approach
                    uses a series of filters to remove features of a black
                    hole's ringing predicted by general relativity, so that
                    potentially subtle, beyond-general-relativity signatures can
                    be revealed.

                    But where does the excess energy accumulate? It accumulates
                    under the form of heat in the different components of the
                    climate system (atmosphere, land, hydrosphere, cryosphere,
                    biosphere). And this is what explains why the Earth is
                    warming, or more globally, climate change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such an inventory corresponding to the period 1960-2020 has
                    been provided by a recently published study. This study
                    shows that the Earth system has been accumulating heat since
                    1971. Moreover, the rate of heat accumulation corresponding
                    to the period 2006-2020 is higher than that corresponding to
                    1971-2020. Most of the excess heat is stored in the ocean
                    (89 percent), mainly in the upper ocean (0-700 metres in
                    depth). The rest of the excess heat is stored in the land
                    (six percent) and the atmosphere (one percent), and has led
                    to the melting of the components of the cryosphere—glaciers,
                    ice sheets and sea ice (four percent).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to storing excess heat, the ocean is also an
                    important CO₂ sink, thus playing an essential role in the
                    regulation of the climate. However, the ocean will become
                    less efficient at capturing CO₂ with the increase in the
                    cumulative emissions of this gas. Why? Because of the
                    positive feedback between the ocean warming and the decrease
                    in the capacity of the oceans to absorb CO₂.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunately, the current state of the ocean is concerning.
                    In 2022, the ocean heat content reached a record high, and
                    58 percent of the ocean surface experienced at least one
                    marine heatwave. Since mid-March this year, the mean ocean
                    surface temperature is the highest ever observed since the
                    beginning of the satellite era. Among other negative impacts
                    on the marine ecosystems, marine heatwaves cause coral
                    bleaching events.

                    All new vehicles will be required to have a "more effective"
                    version of automatic emergency braking (AEB) under a new
                    rule proposed today by the US Department of Transportation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Around 90 percent of light-duty vehicles on the road today
                    come standard with AEB. But the Department of Transportation
                    is proposing a rule that would require automakers to adopt a
                    more robust version of the technology that can stop vehicles
                    traveling at higher speeds and detect vulnerable road users,
                    like cyclists and pedestrians, even at night.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "AEB systems are a big step forward for saving lives on our
                    roadways and preventing crashes," US DOT Deputy Secretary
                    Polly Trottenberg said at a press conference Wednesday.
                    "When deployed, AEB systems can potentially bring a vehicle
                    to a complete halt or at least slow them down so that
                    there's significantly less damage on impact."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2015, a majority of automakers made a voluntary
                    commitment to include AEB as standard in all new vehicles.
                    The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimates that
                    AEB, which uses forward-facing cameras and other sensors to
                    automatically apply the brakes when a crash is imminent,
                    would help prevent 28,000 crashes and 12,000 injuries by
                    2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But now, the Department of Transportation and the National
                    Highway Traffic Safety Administration is ready to go beyond
                    voluntary commitments, proposing a rule that would make AEB
                    mandatory in all new vehicles within four years of the rule
                    going into effect.

                    The nation's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requires
                    airlines to estimate the weight of passengers with one of
                    two options. The first option is to weigh in passengers, as
                    Air New Zealand is doing, or accept the standard weight set
                    by the CAA which is 190 pounds for those 13 years of age and
                    older. The standard weight was last reviewed in 2021 but
                    hasn't been increased since 2004 when the aviation authority
                    increased the average weight from 170 pounds to the current
                    estimated weight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Air New Zealand's survey will begin this week and will
                    run through July 2, and Alastair James, a load control
                    improvement specialist for the airline, said in the press
                    release, "We know stepping on the scales can be daunting. We
                    want to reassure our customers there is no visible display
                    anywhere. No one can see your weight – not even us! It's
                    completely anonymous." He added, "By weighing in, you'll be
                    helping us fly safely and efficiently every time."
