                    The study also identified stretches of DNA in the ancient
                    Rapa Nui genomes that have an Indigenous American origin.
                    Their analysis suggests that the mixing of these populations
                    occurred around the 1300s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Our interpretation is that the ancestors of Rapa Nui first
                    peopled the island and shortly after made a return journey
                    to the Americas,” says Moreno-Mayer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Previous studies have also cast doubt on the story of a
                    population collapse.

                    at Binghamton University in New York says it was “terrific”

                    points to the same conclusions his team reached

                    He says the study confirms that the island was populated
                    with people who lived resiliently and successfully until the
                    arrival of Europeans.

                This has forced the band to issue a press release distancing the
                band from Ticketmaster and its practices.

                    The band released a statement on Wednesday evening denying
                    they were behind the dynamic pricing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It needs to be made clear that Oasis leave decisions on
                    ticketing and pricing entirely to their promoters and
                    management, and at no time had any awareness that dynamic
                    pricing was going to be used," said the statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It said that "meetings between promoters, Ticketmaster and
                    the band's management" had resulted in an agreement to use
                    dynamic pricing "to help keep general ticket prices down as
                    well as reduce touting".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, "the execution of the plan failed to meet
                    expectations".

                    The RX 7800M is a powerful mobile GPU for gaming notebooks.

                  <p>
                    AMD has officially debuted its sixth discrete GPU in its
                    mobile RX 7000 lineup, the
                    <a

                      >RX 7800M</a
                    >. The new GPU is AMD's second mobile RDNA 3 GPU to arrive
                    with a chipset-style architecture and is the runner-up to
                    the flagship RX 7900M.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The RX 7800M is armed with 60 RDNA 3 compute units, 96 ROPS,
                    3,840 stream processors, 48MB of Infinity Cache, and a game
                    clock of 2,145MHz. Bus width was not mentioned, but we
                    suspect it is using a 192-bit interface. Memory bandwidth is
                    rated at up to 432GB/s, memory capacity is 12GB, and GDDR6
                    ICs operate at up to 18 Gbps. GPU power consumption is rated
                    at up to 180W.

                    that the RX 7800M performs very similarly to AMD’s desktop

                    memory configuration, and the GPU’s superior core count
                    configuration offsets the 7700 XT’s low power/clock speed.
                    Compared to Nvidia, the RX 7800M performs faster than its
                    RTX 4070 laptop GPU but is slower than its RTX 4080 mobile
                    counterpart. Performance was also a touch behind Nvidia’s

                    the additional 26 trillion MBs used last year is a 36
                    percent increase over 2022 and is the largest single-year
                    increase in wireless data ever. It is also enough data for
                    every household in the country to watch the first season of

                    The continued proliferation of 5G networks is helping to
                    drive growth as well. The CTIA said that by the end of 2023,
                    nearly 40 percent of all wireless connections – including
                    smartphones, IoT devices, and wearables – were 5G and that
                    more than 330 million Americans were covered by at least one
                    5G network. The total number of wireless connections reached
                    558 million, or more than 1.6 connections for each American.

                    is only expected to increase in the coming years as network
                    operators pump even more money into the system. The industry
                    collectively invested $30 billion in 2023 to improve their
                    networks, pushing the total US wireless industry spend to
                    more than $700 billion to date ($190 billion of which has
                    come since 2018). A total of 432,469 cell sites were in
                    operation across the country at the end of 2023, an increase
                    of 24 percent since 2018.

                    Wireless data is also more affordable now than it ever has
                    been. The cost per MB has dropped 50 percent since 2020 and
                    97 percent versus a decade ago, down to just $.002 per MB.

                    And then there is Amazon Linux 2, a Linux operating system
                    from Microsoft's arch-cloud rival AWS, which is provided
                    free of additional charge and described as a
                    "security-focused, stable, and high-performance execution
                    environment to develop and run cloud applications." AWS also

                    from CentOS to Azure Linux. The experience was doubtless a
                    challenge, but, as we noted then: "This can only be good for
                    Azure Linux, and indeed, for Azure in general."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Does the future of Azure Linux lie somewhere other than a
                    relatively obscure way to host containers on AKS? Foley
                    asked Microsoft and was told: "Azure Linux for VM or bare
                    metal use is not available as a commercially supported
                    offering today. Support is limited to AKS as the host OS."
                  </p>
                  <p>Note the word "today" in that response.</p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft is unlikely to make much money directly from Azure
                    Linux going wide. However, it would be a useful driver to
                    the company's Azure cloud platform and soothe concerns over
                    support and maintenance.

                    However, for many administrators, an attitude of "Anything

                    "Even a pure 'transparency' measure, if it compels
                    non-commercial speech, is subject to strict scrutiny," Smith
                    wrote, concluding that X would likely suffer irreparable
                    harm if key parts of the law weren't blocked.<br />[...]<br />Smith
                    ordered the case to be remanded to the district court "with
                    instructions to enter a preliminary injunction consistent
                    with the opinion." The district court will also have to
                    determine if unconstitutional parts of the law "are
                    severable from the remainder of AB 587 and, if so, which, if
                    any, of the remaining challenged provisions should also be
                    enjoined."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is the outcome that the state had asked for if the
                    appeals court sided with X, giving California a fighting
                    chance to preserve some parts of the law. But if the
                    district court decides to strike the entire content
                    moderation report section from the law, AB 587 would be
                    properly gutted—basically only requiring social media
                    companies to post their terms of service on a government
                    website. That's the only part of the law that X did not
                    fight to enjoin on appeal.

                  <p><b>Who is Citrine Sleet?</b></p>
                  <p>
                    The threat actor that Microsoft tracks as Citrine Sleet is
                    based in North Korea and primarily targets financial
                    institutions, particularly organizations and individuals
                    managing cryptocurrency, for financial gain. As part of its
                    social engineering tactics, Citrine Sleet has conducted
                    extensive reconnaissance of the cryptocurrency industry and
                    individuals associated with it. The threat actor creates
                    fake websites masquerading as legitimate cryptocurrency
                    trading platforms and uses them to distribute fake job
                    applications or lure targets into downloading a weaponized
                    cryptocurrency wallet or trading application based on
                    legitimate applications. Citrine Sleet most commonly infects
                    targets with the unique trojan malware it developed,
                    AppleJeus, which collects information necessary to seize
                    control of the targets' cryptocurrency assets. The FudModule
                    rootkit described in this blog has now been tied to Citrine
                    Sleet as shared tooling with Diamond Sleet.

                    The 53-year-old businessman made his predictions on a series
                    of social media posts this weekend. He said the next
                    "Earth-Mars transfer window" opens in two years, which is
                    when the first Starships to the "Red Planet" will launch.
                    Musk said the Starships will be uncrewed at first "to test
                    the reliability of landing intact on Mars."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But if everything goes well and the landings are successful,
                    just two years later the first crewed flights to Mars will
                    start departing from our planet. Musk said once the first
                    crewed flights depart, their rate will "grow exponentially",
                    adding that his company has the goal of "building a
                    self-sustaining city in about 20 years."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Being multiplanetary will vastly increase the
                    probable lifespan of consciousness, as we will no longer
                    have all our eggs, literally and metabolically, on one
                    planet." Many people were excited by Musk's latest claims as
                    one wrote: "This is huge!!" Another added: "What a time to
                    be alive!" One more commented: "The mission to make life
                    multi-planetary really begins."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Founded in 2002, Musk's SpaceX became the first private
                    company to develop a liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit
                    and the first to send a spacecraft and astronauts to the
                    International Space Station. A year earlier, he had
                    announced the development of Mars Oasis - a project bidding
                    to land a greenhouse and grow plants on Mars.

                    The stainless-steel Starship is made up of a first-stage
                    booster called Super Heavy and a 165-foot-tall upper-stage
                    spacecraft known as Starship. The spacecraft is designed to
                    be "a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry
                    both crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and

                    A leak of data from Disney points to the Disney+ streaming
                    service making about $2.4 billion in revenue in its fiscal
                    quarter ending on March 30. Disney doesn't normally share
                    how much revenue its individual streaming services generate,
                    making this figure particularly interesting.

                    that it was investigating the leak of "over a terabyte of
                    data from one of the communication systems" it uses. In a
                    report this week,
                    <a

                      >The Wall Street Journal</a
                    >
                    (WSJ) said it looked over files leaked by a hacking group
                    called Nullbulge that include "a range of financial and
                    strategy information," apparent login credentials for parts
                    of Disney's cloud infrastructure, and more. The leak
                    includes over "44 million messages from Disney's Slack
                    workplace communications tool, upward of 18,800
                    spreadsheets, and at least 13,000 PDFs," WSJ said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We decline to comment on unverified information The Wall
                    Street Journal has purportedly obtained as a result of a bad
                    actor's illegal activity," a Disney spokesperson told WSJ.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to WSJ, financial information came via "documents
                    shared by staffers that detail company operations," adding,
                    "It isn't official data of the sort Disney discloses to Wall
                    Street and might not reflect final financial performance for
                    a given period." That means we should take these figures
                    with a grain of salt.

                  <p>
                    "Internal spreadsheets suggest that Disney+ generated more
                    than $2.4 billion in revenue in the March quarter," WSJ
                    reported, referencing Disney's fiscal Q2 2024. "It
                    underscores how significant a revenue contributor Hulu is,
                    particularly as Disney seeks to buy out Comcast's stake in
                    that streaming service, and as the two sides spar over its
                    value."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The publication noted that the $2.4 billion figure
                    represents "about 43 percent"—42.5 percent to be more
                    precise—of the direct-to-consumer (DTC) revenue that Disney
                    reported that quarter, which totaled $5,642,000,000 [<a
                      href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/q2-fy24-earnings.pdf"
                      >PDF</a
                    >]. In its Q2 report, Disney put Disney+, Hulu, and Disney+
                    Hotstar under its DTC umbrella. DTC revenue in Q2
                    represented a 13 percent increase compared to the same
                    quarter in the prior fiscal year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Further, subscriber counts for Disney+ and Hulu increased
                    year over year in Q2. The leaks didn't specify how much
                    revenue Disney's streaming businesses made in Q3, but Disney
                    reported that DTC revenue increased to $5.8 billion [<a
                      href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/q3-fy24-earnings.pdf"

                  <p>
                    Right before announcing its Q3 numbers, though,
                    Disney announced
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/so-tired-disney-hulu-espn-prices-increase-by-up-to-25-percent-in-october/"

                    >
                    across Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ by as much as 25 percent. As
                    we wrote at the time, the price hike seemed like an attempt
                    to push people toward bundle packages offering a combination
                    of Disney+, Hulu, and/or ESPN+ (bundles are supposed to make
                    subscriber churn less likely). Disney CFO Hugh Johnston
                    tried convincing us that Disney's streaming catalog meant
                    that it had

                    But the recently leaked numbers shed a little more light on
                    the situation.

                    Cloudflare's global network handles a lot of HTTP requests –
                    over 60 million per second on average. That in and of itself
                    is not news, but it is the starting point to an adventure
                    that started a few months ago and ends with the announcement
                    of a new open-source Rust crate that we are using to reduce
                    our CPU utilization, enabling our CDN to handle even more of
                    the world's ever-increasing Web traffic.
                  </p>
                  <p>Motivation</p>
                  <p>
                    Let's start at the beginning. You may recall a few months
                    ago we released Pingora (the heart of our Rust-based proxy
                    services) as an open-source project on GitHub. I work on the
                    team that maintains the Pingora framework, as well as
                    Cloudflare's production services built upon it. One of those
                    services is responsible for the final step in transmitting
                    users' (non-cached) requests to their true destination.
                    Internally, we call the request's destination server its
                    "origin", so our service has the (unimaginative) name of
                    "pingora-origin".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the many responsibilities of pingora-origin is to
                    ensure that when a request leaves our infrastructure, it has
                    been cleaned to remove the internal information we use to
                    route, measure, and optimize traffic for our customers. This
                    has to be done for every request that leaves Cloudflare, and
                    as I mentioned above, it's a lot of requests. At the time of
                    writing, the rate of requests leaving pingora-origin
                    (globally) is 35 million requests per second.

                    It's not every day that a security researcher acquires the
                    ability to generate counterfeit HTTPS certificates, track
                    email activity, and execute code of his choice on thousands
                    of servers—all in a single blow that cost only $20 and a few
                    minutes to land. But that's exactly what happened recently
                    to Benjamin Harris.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Harris, the CEO and founder of security firm watchTowr, did
                    all of this by registering the domain dotmobilregistry.net.
                    The domain was once the official home of the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.icann.org/en/registry-agreements/org/org-registry-agreement--whois-specifications-8-12-2006-en"
                      >authoritative WHOIS</a
                    >
                    server for .mobi<br />[...]<br />Harris noticed that the
                    previous dotmobiregistry.net owners had allowed the domain
                    to expire. He then scooped it up and set up his own .mobi
                    WHOIS server there.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To Harris's surprise, his server received queries from
                    slightly more than 76,000 unique IP addresses within a few
                    hours of setting it up. Over five days, it received roughly
                    2.5 million queries from about 135,000 unique systems. The
                    entities behind the systems querying his deprecated domain
                    included a who's who of Internet heavyweights comprising
                    domain registrars, providers of online security tools,
                    governments from the US and around the world, universities,
                    and certificate authorities, the entities that issue
                    browser-trusted TLS certificates that make HTTPS work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "watchTowr's research has demonstrated that trust placed in
                    this process by governments and authorities worldwide should
                    be considered misplaced at this stage, in [our] opinion,"

                    official host table and published the ARPANET Directory,
                    which acted as a directory of phone numbers and email
                    addresses of all network users.

                      >Eventually</a
                    >, the directory evolved into the WHOIS system, a
                    query-based server that provided a comprehensive list of all
                    Internet host names and the entities that had registered
                    them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite its antiquated look and feel, WHOIS today remains an
                    essential resource with tremendous consequences.<br />[...]<br />Harris
                    populated his WHOIS database with junk data that
                    corresponded to all real .mobi addresses. Administrative
                    email addresses, and most other fields led to the
                    watchtowr.com domain. For humor, he also added ASCII art.<br />[...]<br />The
                    humor aside, the rogue WHOIS server gave him powers he never
                    should have had. One of the greatest was the ability to
                    dictate the email address certificate authority GlobalSign
                    used to determine if a party applying for a TLS certificate
                    was the rightful owner of the domain name the certificate
                    would apply to. Like the vast majority of its competitors,
                    GlobalSign uses an automated process. An application for
                    example.com, for instance, will prompt the certificate
                    authority to send an email to the administrative email
                    address listed in the authoritative WHOIS for that domain.
                    If the party on the other end clicks a link, the certificate
                    is automatically approved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Harris generated a certificate signing request for
                    microsoft.mobi, he promptly received an email from
                    GlobalSign. The email gave him the option of receiving a
                    verification link at whois@watchtowr.com. For ethical
                    reasons, he stopped the experiment at this point.<br />[...]<br />"The
                    purchase of a $20 domain that allowed the passive inference
                    of .gov/.mil communications and the subversion of the
                    Certificate Authority verification system should be a clear
                    demonstration that the integrity of the trust and security
                    processes we as Internet users rely on is, and continues to
                    be, extremely fragile," Harris wrote in an online interview.
                    "The systems and security we all take for granted is, in
                    many places, truly held together in ways that would not pass
                    approval in 2024."

                    [...] One area where V2X could make the largest impact is
                    for autonomous vehicles (AVs). The number and sophistication
                    of sensors in an autonomous vehicle are vast and increase
                    with the level of autonomy. AVs like those in Phoenix or San
                    Francisco currently depend on LiDAR
                    <i>[light detection and ranging]</i>, radar, and cameras for
                    the majority of their perception. Each sensor fulfills
                    important functions and ensures robust and safe operation,
                    but these vehicle sensor systems are limited by
                    line-of-sight. Using either DSRC or C-V2X, autonomous
                    vehicles can transmit information at a dedicated frequency
                    (~5.9GHz), with V2X acting as an extra sensor that works in
                    all weather conditions and can go through walls and
                    obstacles, effectively solving the line-of-sight problem.
                    The main feasible method for achieving this is to use V2X to
                    broadcast the location-related information of each car. A
                    connected vehicle receiving the information can calculate
                    the possibility of collision with the other vehicle using
                    onboard compute. If the risk is high, the driver (or
                    passenger of an autonomous vehicle) will be immediately
                    warned, and the system will adjust accordingly to avoid a
                    collision safely and effectively.

                    Ford Motor Company is seeking a patent for technology that
                    would allow it to tailor in-car advertising by listening to
                    conversations among vehicle occupants, as well as by
                    analyzing a car's historical location and other data,
                    according to a patent application published late last month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In one example, the controller may monitor user dialogue to
                    detect when individuals are in a conversation," the patent
                    application says. "The conversations can be parsed for
                    keywords or phrases that may indicate where the occupants
                    are traveling to."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The tech — labeled as "in-vehicle advertisement
                    presentation" — will determine where a car is located, how
                    fast it is traveling, what type of road it is driving on and
                    whether it is in traffic. It also will predict routes,
                    speeds and destinations to customize ads to drivers, the
                    application said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The system could pull data from "audio signals within the
                    vehicle and/or historical user data, selecting a number of
                    the advertisements to present to the user during the trip,"
                    the patent application said.

                    The three princes of Sarandib—an ancient Persian name for
                    Sri Lanka—get exiled by their father the king. They are good
                    boys, but he wants them to experience the wider world and
                    its peoples and be tested by them before they take over the
                    kingdom. They meet a cameleer who has lost his camel and
                    tell him they've seen it—though they have not—and prove it
                    by describing three noteworthy characteristics of the
                    animal: it is blind in one eye, it has a tooth missing, and
                    it has a lame leg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After some hijinks the camel is found, and the princes are
                    correct. How could they have known? They used their keen
                    observational skills to notice unusual things, and their wit
                    to interpret those observations to reveal a truth that was
                    not immediately apparent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is a very old tale, sometimes involving an elephant or a
                    horse instead of a camel. But this is the version written by
                    Amir Khusrau in Delhi in 1301 in his poem
                    <i>The Eight Tales of Paradise</i>, and this is the version
                    that one Christopher the Armenian clumsily translated into
                    the Venetian novel <i>The Three Princes of Serendip</i>,
                    published in 1557; a publication that, in a roundabout way,
                    brought the word "serendipity" into the English language.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In no version of the story do the princes accidentally
                    stumble across something important they were not looking
                    for, or find something they were looking for but in a
                    roundabout, unanticipated manner, or make a valuable
                    discovery based on a false belief or misapprehension.
                    Chance, luck, and accidents, happy or otherwise, play no
                    role in their tale. Rather, the trio use their astute
                    observations as fodder for their abductive reasoning. Their
                    main talent is their ability to spot surprising, unexpected
                    things and use their observations to formulate hypotheses
                    and conjectures that then allow them to deduce the existence
                    of something they've never before seen.

                    define serendipity in his new book,
                    <i>Serendipity: the Unexpected in Science</i>. It's hardly a
                    mind-bending or world-altering read, but it is a cute and
                    engaging one, especially when his many stories of discovery
                    veer into ruminations on the nature of inquiry and of
                    science itself.

                      >The Travels and Adventures of Three Princes of
                      Serendip</i
                    >, the intellectual Horace Walpole described
                    "<i>Serendipity</i>, a very expressive word," as
                    "discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things which
                    they were not in quest of."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pievani knows a lot, but like a <i>lot</i>, about the
                    history of science, and he puts it on display here. He
                    quickly debunks all of the instances of alleged serendipity
                    that are always trotted out: Fleming the microbiologist had
                    been studying antibiotics and searching for a commercially
                    viable one for years before his moldy plate led him to
                    penicillin. Yes, Röntgen discovered X-rays by a fluke, but
                    it was only because of the training he received in his
                    studies of cathode rays that he recognized he was observing
                    a new form of radiation. Plenty of people over the course of
                    history splashed some volume of water out of the baths they
                    were climbing into and watched apples fall, but only
                    Archimedes—who had recently been tasked by his king to
                    figure out if his crown was made entirely of gold—and
                    Newton—polymathic inventor of calculus—leapt from these
                    (probably apocryphal) mundane occurrences to their famous
                    discoveries of density and gravity, respectively.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After dispensing with these tired old saws, Pievani then
                    suggests some cases of potentially real—or strong, as he
                    deems it—serendipity. George de Mestral's inventing velcro
                    after noticing burrs stuck to his pants while hiking in the
                    Alps; he certainly wasn't searching for anything, and he
                    parlayed his observation into a useful technology. DuPont
                    chemists' developing nylon, Teflon, and Post-it notes while
                    playing with polymers for assorted other purposes. Columbus
                    "discovering" the Americas (for the fourth time) since he
                    thought the Earth was about a third smaller than
                    Eratosthenes of Cyrene had correctly calculated it to be
                    almost two thousand years earlier, forgotten "due to memory
                    loss and Eurocentric prejudices."

                The European Court of Justice has ruled that Apple has gotten an
                unfair tax advantage by the Irish tax authorities over the
                period 1991 to 2014.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this period, Apple only paid taxes in the European Union
                through 2 subsidiaries in Ireland, Apple Sales International and
                Apple Operations Europe. Both companies were granted exemption
                tax rules by the Irish government in 1991 and 2007. As a result
                of the allocation method endorsed in these tax rulings, Apple
                only paid an effective corporate tax rate that declined from 1%
                in 2003 to 0.005% in 2014 on the profits of Apple Sales
                International.
              </p>
              <p>
                This selective tax treatment of Apple in Ireland is illegal
                under EU state aid rules, because it gives Apple a significant
                advantage over other businesses that are subject to the normal
                national taxation rules, according to the European Commission.

                is correct, and Apple needs to pay illegal tax benefits worth
                €13 billion, plus rent, to the Irish authorities.
              </p>
              <p>There is no appeal possible to this decision.</p>

                    Wars of necessity spawn weapons innovation as each side
                    tries to counter the other's tactics and punch through
                    defenses. For instance—as the Russian invasion of Ukraine
                    has made drone warfare real, both sides have developed ways
                    to bring down drones more easily. One recent Ukrainian

                    In the case of the trench warfare that currently dominates
                    the Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainians have

                    (usually aluminum) and metal oxide (in this case, said to be
                    iron). When a thermite mixture is ignited, it undergoes a

                    about the new drones. The Dragon drones' "effectiveness now
                    looks much higher than in the initial videos," the writer
                    says, adding that they are "capable of burning out
                    vegetation (grass, bushes, trees with foliage) in a short
                    period of time. This will open up the enemy's view of
                    camouflaged positions, which will deprive the defending
                    units of property and ammunition, and the assault groups
                    concentrated for the attack of the element of surprise."

                    Researchers have discovered more than 280 malicious apps for
                    Android that use optical character recognition to steal
                    cryptocurrency wallet credentials from infected devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The apps masquerade as official ones from banks, government
                    services, TV streaming services, and utilities. In fact,
                    they scour infected phones for text messages, contacts, and
                    all stored images and surreptitiously send them to remote
                    servers controlled by the app developers. The apps are
                    available from malicious sites and are distributed in
                    phishing messages sent to targets. There's no indication
                    that any of the apps were available through Google Play.

                    The most notable thing about the newly discovered malware
                    campaign is that the threat actors behind it are employing
                    optical character recognition software in an attempt to
                    extract cryptocurrency wallet credentials that are shown in
                    images stored on infected devices. Many wallets allow users
                    to protect their wallets with a series of random words. The
                    mnemonic credentials are easier for most people to remember
                    than the jumble of characters that appear in the private
                    key. Words are also easier for humans to recognize in
                    images.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Optical character recognition is the process of
                    converting images of typed, handwritten, or printed text
                    into machine-encoded text. OCR has existed for years and has
                    grown increasingly common to transform characters captured
                    in images into characters that can be read and manipulated
                    by software.
                  </p>

                    [...] People who are concerned they may have installed one
                    of the malicious apps should check the McAfee post for a
                    list of associated websites and cryptographic hashes.

                    The malware has received multiple updates over time. Whereas

                    WebSockets have the added benefit of being a more versatile
                    channel.

                    Developers have also updated the apps to better obfuscate
                    their malicious functionality. Obfuscation methods include
                    encoding the strings inside the code so they're not easily
                    read by humans, the addition of irrelevant code, and the
                    renaming of functions and variables, all of which confuse
                    analysts and make detection harder. While the malware is
                    mostly restricted to South Korea, it has recently begun to
                    spread within the UK.

                    "This development is significant as it shows that the threat
                    actors are expanding their focus both demographically and
                    geographically," Ryu wrote. "The move into the UK points to
                    a deliberate attempt by the attackers to broaden their
                    operations, likely aiming at new user groups with localized
                    versions of the malware."

                    to work on cutting costs globally in order to keep electric
                    vehicles affordable for the middle class. Electric vehicles,
                    he has said, cost about 40% more than those powered by
                    gasoline. Without cost reductions, EVs will be too expensive
                    for the middle class, shrinking the market and driving costs
                    up more, Tavares has said.

                I've been working on cars for most of my life and my observation
                is Chrysler/Ram are the worst vehicles on the road. I also own
                two Jeeps that are 50+ years old, however Chrysler has ruined
                the Jeep name by what I assume is cutting corners to save money
                because they're poorly designed and flimsy. Interesting the
                powers that be at Stellantis don't seem to be concerned about
                these issues.

                    One issue in getting office buildings networked that you
                    don't typically face at home is concrete—and lots of it.
                    Concrete walls are an average of 8 inches thick inside most
                    commercial real estate.

                    Keeping a network running through them is not merely a
                    matter of running cord. Not everybody has the knowledge or
                    tools to punch through that kind of wall. Even if they do,
                    you can't just put a hole in something that might be
                    load-bearing or part of a fire control system without
                    imaging, permits, and contractors. The bandwidths that can
                    work through these walls, like 3G, are being phased out, and
                    the bandwidths that provide enough throughput for modern
                    systems, like 5G, can't make it through.

                    it can bend around corners, even 90 degrees. Your particular

                  <p>Before FM, There was APEX</p>
                  <p>
                    In the early and mid-1930s, radio communication was confined
                    to the Low [or Long] Waves (100-500 kHz), Medium Waves
                    (500-1500 kHz), and the Short Waves (1,500 to 30,000 kHz).
                    The frequencies above that, referred to as the "ultra-high
                    frequencies", were truly the "Wild West" of radio. It was a
                    place for experimentation and a possible home to future
                    radio services. Commercial broadcasting to the public took
                    place entirely on the standard broadcast band (540-1600
                    kHz), but it was affected by a number of defects that
                    annoyed the public – natural and man-made static, local and
                    skip interference, atmospheric fading, and limited fidelity.
                    Starting about 1932, a number of brave and daring
                    broadcasters sought permission from the FCC to conduct
                    experiments in the Ultra-Short Waves in an attempt to find
                    solutions to these problems. In particular, these
                    experimental stations wanted to transmit wideband, high
                    fidelity audio. Amplitude modulation, the only known method
                    of transmitting audio at the time, was the method utilized
                    on these so-called "Apex" stations. Experimental licenses
                    were being issued for up to 1,000 watts on frequencies at
                    25-26 MHz and 42 MHz. By 1939, these Apex stations were
                    operating in 34 U.S. cities in 22 states They suffered less
                    skip interference than standard AM stations, but static was
                    still a problem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the same time that these Apex broadcasters were gaining a
                    foothold in the upper frontiers of the radio spectrum, an
                    entirely new type of radio service was also being
                    demonstrated - one that was destined to cause Apex AM to
                    become obsolete. That service was called Frequency
                    Modulation, or FM.

                    [...] As Starliner approached the space station in June,
                    five of 28 control thrusters on Starliner's service module
                    failed, forcing Wilmore to take manual control as ground
                    teams sorted out the problem. Eventually, engineers
                    recovered four of the five thrusters, but NASA's decision
                    makers were unable to convince themselves the same problem
                    wouldn't reappear, or get worse, when the spacecraft
                    departed the space station and headed for reentry and
                    landing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Engineers later determined the control jets lost thrust due
                    to overheating, which can cause Teflon seals in valves to
                    swell and deform, starving the thrusters of propellant.
                    Telemetry data beamed back to the mission controllers from
                    Starliner showed higher-than-expected temperatures on two of
                    the service module thrusters during the flight back to Earth
                    Friday night, but they continued working.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The overheating thrusters are located inside four
                    doghouse-shaped propulsion pods around the perimeter of
                    Starliner's service module. It turns out the doghouses
                    retain heat like a thermos—something NASA and Boeing didn't
                    fully appreciate before this mission—and the thrusters don't
                    have time to cool down when the spacecraft fires its control
                    jets in rapid pulses. It might help if Boeing removes some
                    of the insulating thermal blankets from the doghouses, Stich
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The easiest method of resolving the problem of Starliner's
                    overheating thrusters would be to change the rate and
                    duration of thruster firings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What we would like to do is try not to change the thruster.
                    I think that is the best path," Stich said. "There thrusters
                    have shown resilience and have shown that they perform well,
                    as long as we keep their temperatures down and don't fire
                    them in a manner that causes the temperatures to go up."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There's one thing from this summer's test flight that might,
                    counterintuitively, help NASA certify the Starliner
                    spacecraft to begin operational flights with its next
                    mission. Rather than staying at the space station for eight
                    days, Starliner remained docked at the research lab for
                    three months, half of the duration of a full-up crew
                    rotation flight. Despite the setbacks, Stich estimated the
                    test flight achieved about 85 to 90 percent of its
                    objectives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There's a lot of learning that happens in that three months
                    that is invaluable for an increment mission," Stich said.
                    "So, in some ways, the mission overachieved some objectives,
                    in terms of being there for extra time. Not having the crew
                    onboard, obviously, there are some things that we lack in
                    terms of Butch and Suni's test pilot expertise, and how the
                    vehicle performed, what they saw in the cockpit. We won't
                    have that data, but we still have the wealth of data from
                    the spacecraft itself, so that will go toward the mission
                    objectives and the certification."

                    If Chinese satellite broadband services are widely adopted,
                    Page thinks "the world may witness the rise of a new digital
                    Iron Curtain extending from space, dividing the free flow of
                    information and imposing state control on a global scale."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Which sounds terrifying. However, many nations are already
                    wary of satellite broadband, and are attempting to regulate
                    it like any other telco. China's telcos and networking
                    equipment providers have already been banned in many
                    nations, while Beijing's various diplomatic efforts are
                    increasingly regarded with scepticism after they left
                    countries like Sri Lanka and Zambia in deep debt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With US-based satellite broadband providers like Starlink
                    and Amazon's Kuiper likely to offer service that matches the
                    performance of Chinese providers, nations will have an easy
                    way to route around Beijing's network controls. That is, if
                    they are applied to satellite internet – a circumstance
                    about which Page speculates, but which is not certain to
                    eventuate.

                    [...] As for stopping “anxiety,” Paul makes the very
                    important point that there are
                    <em>legitimate and important</em> reasons why kids may feel
                    some anxiety today, and KOSA shouldn’t stop that information
                    from being shared:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] He also points out — as he did in his original letter
                    — that the KOSA requirements to block certain kinds of ads
                    makes no sense in a world in which kids see those same ads
                    elsewhere:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even as I’ve quoted a bunch here, there’s way more in the
                    article. It is, by far, one of the best explanations of the
                    problems of KOSA and many other bills that use false claims
                    of “regulating design” as an attempt to “protect the kids.”
                    He also talks about the harms of age verification, how it
                    will harm youth activism, and how the structure of the bill
                    will create strong incentives for websites to pull down all
                    sorts of controversial content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is evidence that kids face greater mental health
                    challenges today than in the past. Some studies suggest this
                    is more because of society’s openness to discussing and
                    diagnosing mental health challenges. But there remains no
                    compelling evidence that the internet and social media are
                    causing it. Even worse, as Paul’s article makes abundantly
                    clear, there is nothing out there suggesting that censoring
                    the internet will magically fix those problems. Yet, that’s
                    what KOSA and many other bills are designed to do.

                    In previous studies, the researchers generated a few
                    individual colors of visible laser light. Depending on the
                    dimensions of the microresonator, which determine the colors
                    of light that are generated, scientists produced red, orange
                    and yellow wavelengths, as well as a wavelength of 560
                    nanometers, right at the hairy edge between yellow and green
                    light. However, the team could not generate the full
                    complement of yellow and green colors necessary to fill the
                    green gap.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We didn't want to be good at hitting just a couple of
                    wavelengths," said NIST scientist Yi Sun, a collaborator on
                    the new study. "We wanted to access the entire range of
                    wavelengths in the gap."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To fill the gap, the team modified the microresonator in two
                    ways. First, the scientists slightly thickened it. By
                    changing its dimensions, the researchers more easily
                    generated light that penetrated deeper into the green gap,
                    to wavelengths as short as 532 nanometers (billionths of a
                    meter). With this extended range, the researchers covered
                    the entire gap.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition, the team exposed the microresonator to more air
                    by etching away some of the silicon dioxide layer below it.
                    This had the effect of making the output colors less
                    sensitive to the microring dimensions and the infrared pump
                    wavelength. The lower sensitivity gave the researchers more
                    control in generating slightly different green, yellow,
                    orange and red wavelengths from their device.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result, the researchers found they could create more
                    than 150 distinct wavelengths across the green gap and
                    fine-tune them. "Previously, we could make big changes—red
                    to orange to yellow to green—in the laser colors we could
                    generate with OPO, but it was hard to make small adjustments
                    within each of those color bands," Srinivasan noted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The scientists are now working to boost the energy
                    efficiency with which they produce the green-gap laser
                    colors. Currently, the output power is only a few percent of
                    that of the input laser. Better coupling between the input
                    laser and the waveguide that channels the light into the
                    microresonator, along with better methods of extracting the
                    generated light, could significantly improve the efficiency.

                    Stage 0 cancer is a condition where cells in the body look
                    like cancer cells under a microscope but haven't left their
                    original location. It's also known as carcinoma in situ or
                    noninvasive cancer, because it hasn't invaded any of the
                    surrounding tissues. Sometimes it's not even called cancer
                    at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "A lot of people think of these as kind of precancer
                    lesions," says Julie Nangia, an oncologist at Baylor College
                    of Medicine in Houston.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are many different types of Stage 0 cancer, depending
                    on which tissue or organ the cells are from. Some cancers,
                    like sarcomas (cancers of the bones or skin), don't have a
                    Stage 0.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fishel's diagnosis is called ductal carcinoma in situ, or
                    DCIS. This means some cells in the milk ducts in the breast
                    look abnormal, but those cells haven't grown outside the
                    milk ducts and moved into the rest of the breast tissue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The trouble is, they could. If the abnormal cells do break
                    through the milk duct, the severity of the ensuing cancer
                    can range from Stage 1 to the most advanced Stage 4,
                    depending on how big the tumor is and how far the cancer has
                    spread throughout the body.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before
                    <a
                      href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammographys-limits-becoming-clear"

                    >
                    became the norm, DCIS accounted for just 5 percent of breast
                    cancer diagnoses, says breast cancer surgeon Sara Javid of
                    the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle
                    <em>(SN: 6/13/14)</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, DCIS accounts for about 20 percent of newly diagnosed
                    breast cancers. About 50,000 cases are diagnosed in the
                    United States every year, and it turns up in one out of
                    every 1,300 mammograms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, because Stage 0 breast cancer doesn't really have any
                    symptoms, it's possible to have it and never notice. "A lot
                    of women have DCIS and don't know, especially older women,
                    as it's typically a disease of aging," Nangia says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For other Stage 0 cancers, the situation is different. Stage
                    0 cancers in other internal organs are often
                    <a
                      href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/what-is-cancer/stages-of-cancer"
                      >too small to show up on a scan</a
                    >. Widespread screening tests in other organs might be
                    unsafe or take too many resources to run on a whole
                    population.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The main exception is melanoma in situ, or Stage 0 skin
                    cancer, which can be visible on the skin. That diagnosis is
                    even more common than DCIS: Nearly 100,000 cases are
                    expected in the United States in 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is exactly why we want women to have screening
                    mammograms," Nangia says. "We want to catch cancer at its
                    earliest stages where it's incredibly easy to cure."

                    In March 2023, the district court ruled in favor of the
                    publishers. Judge John G. Koeltl

                    arguing that there was "nothing transformative" about its
                    copying and lending. After the initial ruling in
                    <em>Hachette v. Internet Archive</em>, the parties
                    negotiated terms—the details of which have not been
                    disclosed—though the archive still filed an appeal.

                    James Grimmelmann, a professor of digital and internet law
                    at Cornell University, says the verdict is "not terribly
                    surprising" in the context of how courts have recently
                    interpreted fair use.

                    digitization project. That case is still making its way
                    through the courts. The damages could be up to $400 million,
                    an amount that could pose an existential threat to the

                    filed against major AI companies that offer generative AI
                    tools, and many of the defendants in these cases argue that
                    the fair use doctrine shields their usage of copyrighted
                    data in AI training. Any major lawsuit in which judges
                    refute fair use claims are thus

                    It also arrives at a moment when the Internet Archive's
                    outsize importance in digital preservation is keenly felt.
                    The archive's Wayback Machine, which catalogs copies of
                    websites, has become a vital tool for journalists,
                    researchers, lawyers, and anyone with an interest in
                    internet history. While there are other digital preservation
                    projects, including national efforts from the US Library of
                    Congress, there's nothing like it available to the public.

                    Scientists in the UK have found evidence that microplastics
                    are contaminating archaeological soil samples. The discovery
                    has the potential to upend the way historical remains are
                    preserved.

                    were discovered seven metres underground in samples dating
                    from the first or early second century. They were first
                    excavated in the 1980s.

                    "This feels like an important moment, confirming what we
                    should have expected: that what were previously thought to
                    be pristine archaeological deposits, ripe for investigation,
                    are in fact contaminated with plastics, and that this
                    includes deposits sampled and stored in the late 1980s,"
                    says Professor John Schofield from the University of York's
                    Department of Archaeology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We think of microplastics as a very modern phenomenon
                    as we have only really been hearing about them for the last
                    20 years," says David Jennings, chief executive of York
                    Archaeology.

                  <p>
                    But, he adds, research from 2004 revealed that they have
                    been prevalent in our seas since the 1960s due to the
                    post-Second World War boom in plastic pollution.

                  <p>
                    "This new study shows that the particles have infiltrated
                    archaeological deposits and, like the oceans, this is likely
                    to have been happening for a similar period, with particles
                    found in soil samples taken and archived in 1988 at
                    Wellington Row in York," Jenning explains.

                    is whether microplastics compromise the scientific value of
                    preserved remains. Preserving archaeology in the place where
                    it was found has been the preferred approach to conservation
                    for a number of years. But these new findings could change
                    that.

                    "Our best-preserved remains - for example, the Viking finds
                    at Coppergate - were in a consistent anaerobic waterlogged
                    environment for over 1,000 years, which preserved organic
                    materials incredibly well," Jennings says.

                    The team says further research into the impact of
                    microplastics will be a priority for archaeologists given
                    their potential impact on historical sites.

                    "The Versa blog on the topic subtly chastises affected users
                    for failing to implement recommended security guidance,"
                    Britton said. "CISA's whole point in Secure by Default is
                    that vendors need to find ways to guarantee that the out of
                    the box system is as secure as possible, minimizing the
                    possibility that overworked operators make these types of

                  <p>
                    It also highlights the need for vendors to find a way to
                    future-proof their products against unknown flaws, he added.
                    "Commercially available technologies exist that can allow
                    product and software manufacturers the ability to neutralize
                    entire classes of vulns (known and unknown), without
                    devolving into the whack-a-mole game of bug chasing."

                    The Stratocaster also had timing on its side. It came out
                    amid two other transformative innovations: television and
                    rock 'n' roll. Sales picked up once Buddy Holly showcased a
                    Strat on the "Ed Sullivan Show" in 1957. For the American
                    and English kids who came of age in the '60s—Hendrix, Eric
                    Clapton, David Gilmour, the electrified Bob Dylan at the
                    Newport Folk Festival—the guitar's look was as
                    groundbreaking as its sound. "Cool" depends more on
                    appearance than on wiring, and the Strat's double-cut
                    profile (producing two "wings" at the top) and sensuous body
                    lines were mind-blowing. It looked, one early '60s British
                    pop musician recalled, like "the equivalent of a
                    bullet-finned '59 Cadillac."

                  <p>
                    "At this years Debian conference in South Korea I've
                    presented[1] the new feature of the FAIme web service. You
                    can now build your own Debian live media/ISO.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The web interface provides various settings, for e.g. adding
                    a user name and its password, selecting the Debian release
                    (stable or testing), the desktop environment and the
                    language. Additionally you can add your own list of
                    packages, that will be installed into the live environment.
                    It's possible to define a custom script that gets executed
                    during the boot process. For remote access to the live
                    system, you can easily sepcify a github, gitlab or salsa
                    account, whose public ssh key will be used for passwordless
                    root access. If your hardware needs special grub settings,
                    you may also add those. I'm thinking about adding an
                    autologin checkbox, so the live media could be used for a
                    kiosk system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And finally newer hardware is supported with the help of the
                    backports kernel for the Debian stable release (aka
                    bookworm). This combination is not available from the
                    official Debian live images or the netinst media because the
                    later has some complicated dependencies which are not that
                    easy to resolve2[2]. At DebConf24 I've talked to Alper who
                    has some ideas[3] how to improve the Debian installer
                    environment which then may support a backports kernel."

                    On Wednesday, federal prosecutors charged a North Carolina
                    musician with defrauding streaming services of $10 million
                    through an elaborate scheme involving AI, as
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/nc-man-charged-ai-fake-music.html"
                      >reported by</a
                    >
                    The New York Times. Michael Smith, 52, allegedly used AI to
                    create hundreds of thousands of fake songs by nonexistent
                    bands, then streamed them using bots to collect royalties
                    from platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the AI-generated element of this story is novel, Smith
                    allegedly broke the law by setting up an elaborate fake
                    listener scheme. The US Attorney for the Southern District
                    of New York, Damian Williams,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/north-carolina-musician-charged-music-streaming-fraud-aided-artificial-intelligence"
                      >announced the charges</a
                    >, which include wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy.
                    If convicted, Smith could face up to 20 years in prison for
                    each charge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To avoid detection, Smith spread his streaming activity
                    across numerous fake songs, never playing a single track too
                    many times. He also generated unique names for the
                    AI-created artists and songs, trying to blend in with the
                    quirky names of legitimate musical acts. Smith used artist
                    names like "Callous Post" and "Calorie Screams," while their
                    songs included titles such as "Zygotic Washstands" and
                    "Zymotechnical."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Initially, Smith uploaded his own original
                    compositions to streaming platforms but found that his small
                    catalog failed to generate significant income. In an attempt
                    to scale up, he briefly collaborated with other musicians,
                    reportedly offering to play their songs for royalties,
                    though these efforts failed. This led Smith to pivot to
                    AI-generated music in 2018 when he partnered with an
                    as-yet-unnamed AI music company CEO and a music promoter to
                    create a large library of computer-generated songs. The
                    district attorney
                    <a
                      href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/north-carolina-musician-charged-music-streaming-fraud-aided-artificial-intelligence"
                      >announcement</a
                    >
                    did not specify precisely what method Smith used to generate
                    the songs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When confronted by a music distribution company about
                    "multiple reports of streaming abuse" in 2018, The New York
                    Times says that Smith acted shocked and strongly denied any
                    wrongdoing, insisting there was "absolutely no fraud going
                    on whatsoever."

                    A judge in Ohio has issued a temporary restraining order
                    against a security researcher who presented evidence that a
                    recent ransomware attack on the city of Columbus scooped up
                    reams of sensitive personal information, contradicting

                    [....] Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther said on August 13 that
                    a "breakthrough" in the city's forensic investigation of the
                    breach found that the sensitive files Rhysida obtained were

                    researcher David Leroy Ross contacted local news outlets and
                    presented evidence that showed the data Rhysida published
                    was fully intact and contained highly sensitive information
                    regarding city employees and residents.

                    alleged damages for criminal acts, invasion of privacy,
                    negligence, and civil conversion. The lawsuit claimed that
                    downloading documents from a dark web site run by ransomware
                    attackers amounted to him "interacting" with them and
                    required special expertise and tools. The suit went on to
                    challenge Ross alerting reporters to the information, which
                    it claimed would not be easily obtained by others.

                    Thursday, Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein defended his
                    decision to sue Ross and obtain the restraining order.

                    data or disseminating it to reporters, but it has no effect
                    on those who plan to use the data for malicious purposes.

                    "Researchers have peered into the brains and bodies of
                    living animals after discovering that a common food dye can
                    make skin, muscle and connective tissues temporarily
                    transparent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Applying the dye to the belly of a mouse made its liver,
                    intestines and bladder clearly visible through the abdominal
                    skin, while smearing it on the rodent's scalp allowed
                    scientists to see blood vessels in the animal's brain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Treated skin regained its normal colour when the dye was
                    washed off, according to researchers at Stanford University,
                    who believe the procedure opens up a host of applications in
                    humans, from locating injuries and finding veins for drawing
                    blood to monitoring digestive disorders and spotting
                    tumours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Instead of relying on invasive biopsies, doctors might be
                    able to diagnose deep-seated tumours by simply examining a
                    person's tissue without the need for invasive surgical
                    removal," said Dr Guosong Hong, a senior researcher on the
                    project. "This technique could potentially make blood draws
                    less painful by helping phlebotomists easily locate veins
                    under the skin."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The most surprising part of this study is that we
                    usually expect dye molecules to make things less
                    transparent. For example, if you mix blue pen ink in water,
                    the more ink you add, the less light can pass through the
                    water," Hong said. "In our experiment, when we dissolve
                    tartrazine in an opaque material like muscle or skin, which
                    normally scatters light, the more tartrazine we add, the
                    clearer the material becomes. But only in the red part of
                    the light spectrum. This goes against what we typically
                    expect with dyes."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers describe the process as "reversible and
                    repeatable", with skin reverting to its natural colour once
                    the dye is washed away. At the moment, transparency is
                    limited to the depth the dye penetrates, but Hong said
                    microneedle patches or injections could deliver the dye more
                    deeply.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The procedure has not yet been tested on humans and
                    researchers will need to show it is safe to use,
                    particularly if the dye is injected beneath the skin.

                    Volkswagen AG is considering factory closures in Germany for
                    the first time in its 87-year history, parting with
                    tradition and risking a feud with unions in a step that

                    After years of ignoring overcapacity and slumping
                    competitiveness, the German auto giant's moves are likely to
                    kick off a broader reckoning in the industry. The reasons
                    are clear: Europe's efforts to compete with Chinese rivals
                    and Tesla Inc. in electric cars are faltering. (full article

                    It's no secret that government IT can be a huge bummer. The
                    records retention! The security! So government workers
                    occasionally take IT into their own hands with creative but,
                    err, unauthorized solutions.

                    For instance, a former US Ambassador to Kenya in 2015 got in
                    trouble after

                    (!) to access an unsecured network (!!) that let him log in
                    to Gmail (!!!), where he did much of his official
                    business—rules and security policies be damned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the ambassador had nothing on senior enlisted crew
                    members of the littoral combat ship

                    deal with the problem was to secretly bolt a Starlink
                    terminal to the "O-5 level weatherdeck" of a US warship.<br />[...]<br />The

                    to uncover the background of this strange story.<br />[...]<br />the
                    chiefs don't appear to have taken amazing security
                    precautions once everything was installed. For one thing,
                    they called the network "STINKY." For another, they were
                    soon adding more gear around the ship, which was bound to
                    raise further questions. The chiefs found that the Wi-Fi
                    signal coming off the Starlink satellite transceiver
                    couldn't cover the entire ship, so during a stop in Pearl
                    Harbor, they bought "signal repeaters and cable" to extend
                    coverage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sailors on the ship then began finding the STINKY network
                    and asking questions about it.<br />[...]<br />Ship officers
                    heard the scuttlebutt about STINKY, of course, and they
                    began asking questions and doing inspections, but they never
                    found the concealed device. On August 18, though, a civilian
                    worker from the Naval Information Warfare Center was
                    installing an authorized
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starshield"
                      >SpaceX "Starshield" device</a
                    >
                    and came across the unauthorized SpaceX device hidden on the
                    weatherdeck.<br />[...]<br />All of the chiefs who used,
                    paid for, or even knew about the system without disclosing
                    it were given "administrative nonjudicial punishment at
                    commodore's mast," said Navy Times.

                    So there you go, kids: two object lessons in poor
                    decision-making. Whether working from an embassy bathroom or
                    the deck of a littoral combat ship, if you're a government
                    employee, think twice before giving in to the sweet
                    temptation of unsecured, unauthorized wireless Internet
                    access.

                    Well, here's a not-so-fun new twist in the
                    search-and-seizure narrative. Car owners are being deprived
                    of their vehicles just because cops think footage of a crime
                    may have been captured by the car's on-board cameras.

                    [....] But being in the wrong place at the wrong time might
                    mean drivers going without cars because cops have decided
                    the best way to secure this potential evidence is to take
                    cars away from their drivers. Here's Rachel Swan,

                        A Canadian tourist was visiting Oakland recently when he
                        had to talk someone out of taking his Tesla from a hotel
                        parking lot.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This was no thief. It was the Oakland Police Department.
                        Turns out, the Tesla may have witnessed a homicide.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In Oakland and beyond, police called to crime scenes are
                        increasingly looking for more than shell casings and
                        fingerprints. They're scanning for Teslas parked nearby,
                        hoping their unique outward-facing cameras captured key
                        evidence. And, the Chronicle has found, they're even
                        resorting to obtaining warrants to tow the cars to
                        ensure they don't lose the video.
                      </p>

                  <p>
                    [....] At least warrants appear to be involved at this
                    point, which means there's a paper trail documenting law
                    enforcement's seizure of the inanimate "witness."
                    Unfortunately, that's not going to mean much to car owners
                    who may walk out of their houses, businesses, or places of
                    worship to discover their vehicle missing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even though this is handled about as well as it can be at
                    this point in time, this kind of thing is only going to
                    become more common. And, inevitably, some cops are going to
                    decide they don't have time to get a warrant, much less make
                    a good faith effort to secure the recordings from the
                    vehicle's owner before initiating a seizure.

                    Rakić's proposal goes further, providing an alternative
                    resolution to the Fermi paradox that goes beyond the
                    solution that aliens are so intelligent and advanced
                    humanity cannot perceive them. But "that is just a fragment
                    of the solution that is being proposed in this paper," he
                    writes.

                    They don't have to take a new form to avoid human detection;
                    they may have always existed this way. They might exist all
                    around us, even if they don't surpass us in intelligence or
                    have very little intelligence at all.

                    [...] Rakić concludes, "The formulation of the Fermi paradox
                    is actually too narrow. The paradox is indeed why humans
                    have not perceived extraterrestrial life in a universe that
                    is enormous, but the question is much broader: What may
                    exist around humans that humans cannot perceive ('around'
                    meaning both terrestrial, extraterrestrial in our universe,
                    as well as extraterrestrial in other universes)? That is the
                    key question.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The Fermi paradox is only an anthropocentric formulation of
                    one aspect of this question."

                    [...] Astrobotic developed and built the Peregrine lander
                    under contract to NASA, which awarded the company a $108
                    million contract to deliver a suite of government-sponsored
                    science payloads to the lunar surface. Peregrine Mission One
                    was the first mission launched under the umbrella of NASA's
                    Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, which buys
                    transportation from commercial vendors for science payloads
                    heading to the Moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It turns out Astrobotic officials were aware of the risk of
                    a pressure control valve failing on the Peregrine
                    spacecraft. The lander had two of these valves, one
                    controlling the flow of helium into the fuel tank and
                    another into the oxidizer tank. During ground testing before
                    the mission, the pressure control valve on the fuel side
                    started leaking, so engineers swapped it out for a new one.
                    The similar valve on the oxidizer side, which failed in
                    space, showed no problems during ground tests, according to
                    Sharad Bhaskaran, Astrobotic's mission director for
                    Peregrine Mission One.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although the pressure control valve on the oxidizer side was
                    the same design, Astrobotic decided not to replace it
                    because doing so would have required disassembling large
                    portions of the Peregrine lander, further delaying the
                    mission's launch, which was already running several years
                    behind schedule.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tests of a spare pressure control valve that were conducted
                    following the Peregrine mission confirmed it could leak
                    after engineers subjected it to vibrations like those it
                    would experience during a rocket launch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Astrobotic's next lander, named Griffin, is larger and
                    more complex than Peregrine. It will use the redesigned
                    pressure control valves, and Astrobotic will install
                    pressure regulators and so-called latch valves in the helium
                    system on Griffin. These new components would control the
                    flow of helium into the propellant tanks in the event of a
                    similar pressure control valve failure on Astrobotic's next
                    mission, officials said Tuesday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We’ve got increased reliability now in the system to
                    mitigate against that single-point failure," Clarke said.

                    The LUX-ZEPLIN, or LZ, experiment has searched for and ruled
                    out the existence of dark matter particles with a wide swath
                    of properties, researchers report August 26 at two
                    conferences. Dark matter is a substance whose influence can
                    be seen on the scale of galaxies and galaxy clusters, but
                    which has never been directly detected.

                    LZ searches for a hypothetical type of dark matter particle
                    called a weakly interacting massive particle, specifically
                    WIMPs with masses above 9 billion electron volts. (For
                    comparison, a proton has a mass of around 1 billion electron
                    volts). The LZ detector, filled with 10 metric tons of

                    possibilities — or find evidence of it.

                  <p>
                    After an initial euphoric rush to the cloud, administrators
                    are questioning the value and promise of the tech giant's
                    services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to a
                    <a href="https://www.civo.com/cost-of-cloud-report-2024"
                      >report</a
                    >
                    published by UK cloud outfit Civo, more than a third of
                    organizations surveyed reckoned that their move to the cloud
                    had failed to live up to promises of cost-effectiveness.
                    Over half reported a rise in their cloud bill.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although the survey, unsurprisingly, paints Civo in a
                    flattering light, some of its figures may make uncomfortable
                    reading for customers sold on the promises from
                    hyperscalers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the IT world, there is an expectation that bang for
                    buck increases as time goes by, but in this example, prices
                    are rising faster than the
                    <a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/"
                      >rate of inflation</a
                    >, and what customers receive for their money remains
                    unchanged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The giddy enthusiasm might have waned in favor of some
                    hard-nosed ROI calculations, and some workloads might jump
                    away from cloud vendors, "but this will not constitute a
                    change in direction – just a ripple in the stream of dollars
                    flowing to the cloud."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, are prices increasing? The answer has to be yes. How
                    much of those rises are down to the major vendors
                    opportunistically adding of a few percentage points versus
                    an increase in fixed costs, such as electricity, is pretty
                    much irrelevant. The advice remains the same: the cloud is
                    here to stay although its luster has dulled over time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Time, then, to wheel out the ROI calculator and ensure
                    there's been no stealthy vendor lock-in. All clouds and all
                    workloads are, after all, not created equal.

                    In a pitch deck to prospective customers, one of Facebook's
                    alleged marketing partners explained how it listens to
                    users' smartphone microphones and advertises to them
                    accordingly.

                    >, the TV and radio news giant Cox Media Group (CMG) claims
                    that its so-called "Active Listening" software uses
                    artificial intelligence (AI) to "capture real-time intent
                    data by listening to our conversations."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Advertisers can pair this voice-data with behavioral data
                    to target in-market consumers," the deck continues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the same slideshow, CMG counted Facebook, Google, and
                    Amazon as clients of its "Active Listening" service. After
                    <em>404</em> reached out to Google about its partnership,
                    the tech giant removed the media group from the site for its
                    "<a
                      href="https://ads.google.com/intl/en_us/home/partners/become-a-partner/"
                      >Partners Program</a
                    >," which prompted Meta, the owner of Facebook, to admit
                    that it is reviewing CMG to see if it violates any of its
                    terms of service.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An Amazon spokesperson, meanwhile, told <em>404</em> that
                    its Ads arm "has never worked with CMG on this program and
                    has no plans to do so. The spox added, confusingly, that if
                    one of its marketing partners violates its rules, the
                    company will take action.

                    This latest leak marks the third time in a year that
                    <em>404</em> has reported on CMG's shady voice targeting
                    service. Last December, the independent news site not only

                    The main differences are that the Central Offices are
                    typically smaller, and the cable distances are much greater.

                      cold war hardened shelter which generated a reasonable
                      discussion. This is another one of those submissions which
                      show how regular everyday systems are actually put
                      together and maintained; in this case part of the standard
                      telephone system. It is informative and I discovered
                      several things about a standard US telephone cabling that
                      I did not know before e.g. some cable is pressurized with
                      air to help prevent water ingress, but it provides
                      additional benefits to the engineers who have to maintain
                      the system.</em

                    A pioneering study titled "Causal effect of video gaming on
                    mental well-being in Japan 2020-2022," published in
                    <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>, has conducted the most
                    comprehensive investigation to date on the causal
                    relationship between video gaming and mental well-being.
                    This research, the first to demonstrate this relationship
                    using real-life data, challenges commonly held views about
                    the effects of gaming.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study found substantial improvements in mental
                    well-being: owning a Nintendo Switch improved mental health
                    by 0.60 standard deviations, while owning a PlayStation 5
                    improved it by 0.12 standard deviations. Additionally,
                    PlayStation 5 ownership increased life satisfaction by 0.23
                    standard deviations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our findings challenge common stereotypes about gaming
                    being harmful or merely providing temporary euphoria," said
                    lead author Hiroyuki Egami, PhD., Assistant Professor at
                    Nihon University. "We've shown that gaming can improve
                    mental health and life satisfaction across a broad spectrum
                    of individuals."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Egami further explained, "Many earlier studies drew
                    conclusions from correlational analysis with observational
                    data, which can't distinguish between cause and effect. Our
                    natural experimental design allows us to confidently say
                    that gaming actually leads to improved well-being, rather
                    than just being associated with it."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Notably, the study found that while the PlayStation 5
                    offered relatively smaller psychological benefits for
                    children, the Nintendo Switch provided larger psychological
                    benefits. These findings question the stereotype that games
                    are universally harmful to children and emphasize the
                    importance of considering the multifaceted nature of gaming,
                    including platforms, genres, and playing styles, in research
                    and policymaking.

                    The Linux kernel is not a place to work if you're not ready
                    for some, shall we say, spirited argument. Still, one key
                    developer in the project to expand Rust's place inside the
                    largely C-based kernel feels the "nontechnical nonsense" is
                    too much, so he's retiring.

                    "Here's the thing: you're not going to force all of us to
                    learn Rust." In the context of Filho's request that Linux's
                    file system implement Rust bindings, Ts'o says that while he
                    knows he must fix all the C code for any change he makes, he
                    cannot or will not fix the Rust bindings that may be

                    about Rust's attempts to find a place inside the Kernel. In
                    theory the kernel should welcome enthusiastic input from
                    motivated newcomers. "In practice, the Linux community is
                    the wild wild west, and sweeping changes are infamously
                    difficult to achieve consensus on, and this is by far the
                    broadest sweeping change ever proposed for the project,"
                    DeVault writes.<br />[...]<br />Rather than test their
                    patience with the kernel's politics, DeVault suggests Rust
                    developers build a Linux-compatible kernel from scratch.
                    "Freeing yourselves of the [Linux Kernel Mailing List]
                    political battles would probably be a big win for the
                    ambitions of bringing Rust into kernel space," DeVault
                    writes.<br />[...]<br />Linus Torvalds [...] took

                  <p>
                    "I was expecting [Rust] updates to be faster, but part of
                    the problem is that old-time kernel developers are used to C
                    and don't know Rust," Torvalds said. "They're not exactly
                    excited about having to learn a new language that is, in
                    some respects, very different. So there's been some pushback
                    on Rust." Torvalds added, however, that "another reason has
                    been the Rust infrastructure itself has not been super
                    stable."

                    his deportation from New Zealand to the U.S. on charges of
                    copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to New Zealand's Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith,
                    the date for the extradition was not set, and Goldsmith said
                    Dotcom would be allowed "a short period of time to consider
                    and take advice" on the decision. "Don't worry I have a
                    plan," Dotcom posted on X this week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The saga stretches to the 2012 arrest of Dotcom in a
                    dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion, along with other
                    company officers. Prosecutors said Megaupload raked in at
                    least $175 million — mainly from people who used the site to
                    illegally download songs, television shows and movies —
                    before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dotcom has fought the order for years — lambasting the
                    investigation and arrests — but in 2021 New Zealand's
                    Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be
                    extradited. It remained up to the country's Justice Minister
                    to decide if the extradition should proceed.

                    Participants demonstrated a high degree of confidence in
                    their answers, suggesting that participants thought they had
                    a good understanding of the people in their out-group,
                    despite this not being the case. In comparison, participants
                    could consistently make accurate predictions about those in
                    their in-group with less information.

                    "Our study shows that people have a good understanding of
                    people who are similar to themselves and their confidence in
                    their understanding is well-placed. However, our
                    understanding of people with different views to our own is
                    demonstrably poor. The more confident we are that we can
                    understand them, the more likely it is that we are wrong.
                    People have poor awareness of their inability to understand
                    people that differ from themselves," says Dr. Bryony Payne.

                  <p>
                    [...] Dr. Caroline Catmur, Reader in Cognitive Psychology at
                    King's IoPPN and the study's senior author, said, "We live
                    in an increasingly polarized society and many people are
                    very confident in their understanding of those who don't
                    share their beliefs. However, our research shows that people
                    are willing to reconsider once they are made aware of their
                    mistakes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "While there is no quick fix in a real-world setting, if
                    everyone interacted with a more diverse group of people,
                    talked directly to them and got to know them, it's likely we
                    would understand each other better. Conversations with
                    people who hold different beliefs could help challenge our
                    incorrect assumptions about each other."

                    were speeding down a Russian road in Kursk with a Ukrainian
                    attack drone on your tail. That's the reality facing some
                    Russians living near the front lines after Ukraine's
                    surprise seizure of Russian territory in Kursk Oblast. And
                    they're complaining about it on Telegram.

                    people are receiving speeding fines when trying to outrun
                    FPVs [first-person-view attack drones]. Some have resorted
                    to covering their license plates but the traffic police
                    force them to remove them."

                    Volunteers and military volunteers who arrived in the Kursk
                    region are asking the traffic police not to fine them for
                    speeding when they are escaping from the drones of the
                    Ukrainian Armed Forces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Several people who are near the combat zone told Mash about
                    this. Cameras are still recording violations in the border
                    area, and when people try to escape from the drones, they
                    receive letters of happiness [tickets]. One of the
                    well-known military activists was charged 9k [rubles,
                    apparently—about US$100] in just one day. He accelerated on
                    a highway that is attacked almost every hour by enemy FPV
                    drones. Some cover their license plates, but the traffic
                    police stop them and demand that they remove the stickers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mash claims that the traffic police are sympathetic and that
                    given the drone situation, "speeding can be considered as
                    committed in a state of extreme necessity." But those who
                    receive a speeding ticket will have to challenge it in court
                    on these grounds.
