                MEP Patrick Breyer (Germany, Pirate Party), one of the few

                    The experts made clear that an "increase in the number of
                    reported contents does not necessarily lead to a
                    corresponding increase in investigations and prosecutions
                    leading to better protection of children. As long as the
                    capacity of law enforcement agencies is limited to its
                    current size, an increase in reports will make effective
                    prosecution of depictions of abuse more difficult."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition, the study finds: "It is undisputed that
                    children need to be protected from becoming victims of child
                    abuse and depictions of abuse online... but they also need
                    to be able to enjoy the protection of fundamental rights as
                    a basis for their development and transition into
                    adulthood." It warns: „With regards to adult users with no
                    malicious intentions, chilling effects are likely to occur."

                    The Kodi Foundation has disclosed a data breach after
                    hackers stole the organization's MyBB forum database
                    containing user data and private messages and attempted to
                    sell it online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kodi is a cross-platform open-source media player,
                    organizer, and streaming suite, that supports a vast array
                    of third-party add-ons enabling the users to access content
                    from various sources or customize their experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The now-shut down Kodi forum has roughly 401,000 members who
                    used it to discuss media streaming, exchange tips, offer
                    support, share new add-ons, and more in 3 million posts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to an announcement published by the platform on
                    Saturday, hackers stole the forum database by logging into
                    the Admin console using an inactive staff member's
                    credentials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once they gained access to the admin panel, they created and
                    downloaded
                    <a href="https://docs.mybb.com/1.8/administration/backups/"
                      >database backups</a
                    >
                    multiple times in 2023.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "MyBB admin logs show the account of a trusted but currently
                    inactive member of the forum admin team was used to access
                    the web-based MyBB admin console twice: on 16 February and
                    again on 21 February," explains Kodi in a message to its
                    users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The account was used to create database backups which were
                    then downloaded and deleted. It also downloaded existing
                    nightly full-backups of the database."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Kodi team confirmed that the actual account owner did
                    not perform these actions on the admin console, indicating
                    that the staff member's credentials were likely stolen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If you have used the same username and password on any
                    other site, you should follow the password reset/change
                    procedure for that site."

                So Soylentils, do (or, in the case of the forum, did) you use
                Kodi or, more importantly, their forum?
              </p>
              <p>
                If so, will this breach affect how/whether or not you (continue)

                    The law requires social media companies that earn more than
                    $100 million in annual revenue to work with third-party
                    services to verify new account holders' personal
                    information. This is done using "any commercially reasonable
                    age verification method" or government-issued IDs such as
                    photo IDs or driver's licenses. Current account holders
                    won't be affected.

                    The law states that social media companies are defined as
                    any online forum that lets users create public profiles and
                    interact with each other through digital content.

                    that in the final days of negotiations over the bill,
                    Arkansas lawmakers approved an amendment that appears to
                    exempt some of the world's biggest social media companies.
                    Given all the concern over TikTok's influence and its links
                    with China, it's surprising to see that social media
                    platforms that permit users to "generate short video clips
                    of dancing, voice overs, or other acts of entertainment in
                    which the primary purpose is not educational or informative"
                    are exempt. That would also seem to cover Facebook,
                    Instagram, Snapchat, as well as TikTok - but apparently not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Other exemptions include social media companies that
                    "exclusively" offer subscription content, and those focused
                    on "professional networking" and "career development" (i.e.,
                    LinkedIn). Companies that "exclusively offer" video
                    gaming-focused social networking features aren't covered,
                    either, which could include Twitch despite it not really
                    being a social media platform.

                    Transitioning from the traditional five-day, 40-hour work
                    week to a four-day week has the potential to reduce burnout
                    and boost performance among workers without negatively
                    affecting employer productivity, according to Cutler. "They
                    could also bring a competitive edge for employers who are
                    able to attract and retain talent," he said.

                  <p>
                    Gartner is seeing "a high amount of interest" in four-day
                    workweeks from its clients, according to Emily Rose McRae, a
                    senior director with the research firm's HR practice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Many organizations, and their HR leaders, see a four-day
                    workweek as the next step in their flexibility offerings for
                    employees — offering flexibility on when and how much people
                    work, in addition to where," she said. "For organizations
                    that haven't been able to successfully implement remote or
                    hybrid work, or that fundamentally can't for at least part
                    of their workforce, a four-day workweek offers an
                    opportunity to remain competitive in a still very tight
                    talent market by offering a different kind of flexibility."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In general, four-day work week pilots have shown that
                    productivity increases with reduced hours, so reducing pay
                    may not be necessary — but it is an option for organizations
                    that have regulatory or legal limits on reducing hours
                    without reducing pay, McRae said.

                    work schedule because the benefits are so clear.

                      71% of employees had reduced levels of burnout by the end
                      of the trial.

                      37% of employees saw improvements in physical health.

                    While both men and women benefit from the UK's four-day
                    week, women's experience is generally better, the study
                    said.

                    mental health, and reduced commuting time," Dale Whelehan,
                    Ph.D., a behavioral scientist and CEO of 4 Day Week Global,
                    said in an earlier interview. "Encouragingly, the burden of
                    non-work duties appears to be balancing out, with more men
                    taking on a greater share of housework and childcare."

                    [...] "Through our research and our models, we contrast
                    three varieties of retailers, relevant when consumers are
                    initially uncertain as to which is the best fit," says
                    Bar-Isaac. "The first is a retailer that offers more choice
                    through a deeper selection. The second is the retailer that
                    offers less choice, or a more shallow selection.
                    Alternatively, an online channel may provide little
                    opportunity to assess fit, even if there is a deep
                    selection."

                    The researchers found that the first type of retailers,
                    those with deeper selections, tend to hold to higher prices
                    because they know that once a consumer enters the store,
                    they will likely find the best fit and make a purchase.

                  <p>
                    This means that the one consumer most likely to actually
                    influence price is the not-so-choosy consumer who starts off
                    by visiting a shallow store and expect that they will make a
                    purchase once they get there, as long as they can find a
                    sufficient fit. If they don't find an acceptable fit, they
                    will move on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This group of consumers is the only one in the economy that
                    compares prices," adds Bar-Isaac. "The size of this group is
                    large enough that it plays a key role in price
                    determination."

                    [...] "Still, most consumers are not as likely to search
                    more than one store to look for the perfect match and a

                    we have dubbed 'shallow' are more likely to sell a higher
                    volume of a given product at a more competitive price, while
                    stores we've dubbed 'deep' are more likely to sell their
                    products at a higher price, oftentimes to more selective
                    consumers."

                    Elon Musk gave a rare interview to an actual reporter late
                    on Tuesday, speaking to BBC reporter James Clayton on
                    Twitter Spaces. During the
                    <a
                      href="https://twitter.com/TexasLindsay_/status/1646006232484913153"
                      >interview</a
                    >, Clayton pressed Musk on whether his purchase of Twitter
                    was, in the end, something he went through with willingly,
                    or whether it was something he did because the active court
                    case at the time in which Twitter was trying to force him to
                    go through with the sale was going badly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The answer (which we all suspected anyway) was that Musk did
                    indeed only do the deal because he believed legally, he was
                    going to be forced to do so anyway. Here's the relevant
                    transcript from the Twitter Spaces audio:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        Clayton: So then you change your mind again, and decided
                        to buy it – did you do that? Did you do that?
                      </p>
                      <p>Musk: Well, I kind of had to.</p>
                      <p>
                        Clayton: Right. Did you do that, because you thought
                        that a court would make you do that?
                      </p>
                      <p>Musk: Yes.</p>
                      <p>Clayton: Right.</p>
                      <p>Musk: Yes, that is the reason.</p>
                      <p>
                        Clayton: So you were still trying to get out of it. And
                        then you just were advised by lawyers, "Look, you're
                        going to buy this?"
                      </p>
                      <p>Musk: Yes.</p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    In case you don't recall (it was all the way back in
                    September/October last year which is basically an eternity
                    ago in current Twitter time), Twitter took Musk to trial to
                    force him to honor his signed obligation to acquire the
                    company for the agreed-upon price of $44 billion, or $54.20
                    per share. Musk was contending that his obligation was void
                    because Twitter had, he claimed, inflated its real user
                    numbers and understated the number of bots on the platform.
                  </p>

                      company</a
                    >, a move most agreed at the time was made because his legal
                    case was weak and the trial was clearly not going his way.

                    PassGAN is a shortened combination of the words "Password"
                    and "generative adversarial networks." PassGAN is an
                    approach that
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.00440"
                      >debuted in 2017</a
                    >. It uses machine learning algorithms running on a neural
                    network in place of conventional methods devised by humans.
                    These GANs generate password guesses after autonomously
                    learning the distribution of passwords by processing the
                    spoils of previous real-world breaches. These guesses are
                    used in offline attacks made possible when a database of

                    [...] It's true that with the sources that are currently
                    available, human interpretation is needed to provide
                    context, says Kaplan, though he thinks this could change
                    once a sufficient number of historical documents are made
                    machine readable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But he imagines an application of machine learning that's
                    more transformational—and potentially more problematic.
                    Generative AI could be used to make predictions that flesh
                    out blank spots in the historical record—for instance, about
                    the number of apprentices in a Venetian artisan's
                    workshop—based not on individual records, which could be
                    inaccurate or incomplete, but on aggregated data. This may
                    bring more non-elite perspectives into the picture but runs
                    counter to standard historical practice, in which
                    conclusions are based on available evidence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, a more immediate concern is posed by neural networks
                    that create false records.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In other words, there's a risk that artificial
                    intelligence, from historical chatbots to models that make
                    predictions based on historical records, will get things
                    very wrong. Some of these mistakes are benign anachronisms:
                    a query to Aristotle on the chatbot Character.ai about his
                    views on women (whom he saw as inferior) returned an answer
                    that they should "have no social media." But others could be
                    more consequential—especially when they're mixed into a
                    collection of documents too large for a historian to be
                    checking individually, or if they're circulated by someone
                    with an interest in a particular interpretation of history.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even if there's no deliberate deception, some scholars have
                    concerns that historians may use tools they're not trained
                    to understand. "I think there's great risk in it, because we
                    as humanists or historians are effectively outsourcing
                    analysis to another field, or perhaps a machine," says
                    Abraham Gibson, a history professor at the University of
                    Texas at San Antonio. Gibson says until very recently,
                    fellow historians he spoke to didn't see the relevance of
                    artificial intelligence to their work, but they're
                    increasingly waking up to the possibility that they could
                    eventually yield some of the interpretation of history to a
                    black box.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While skepticism toward such new technology persists,
                    the field is gradually embracing it, and Valleriani thinks
                    that in time, the number of historians who reject
                    computational methods will dwindle. Scholars' concerns about
                    the ethics of AI are less a reason not to use machine
                    learning, he says, than an opportunity for the humanities to
                    contribute to its development.

                    killed at least four of the animals.

                  <p>
                    "We wanted to get the word out. We're seeing something we
                    haven't seen before, we want people to know about it and we
                    want people working on marine mammals to be aware of these
                    weird findings," said Miller, a wildlife veterinarian
                    specialist with the California Department of Fish and

                  <p>
                    In March, a study from the DFW and the University of
                    California, Davis, revealed that a rare strain of the
                    parasite, never before reported in aquatic animals, was tied
                    to the deaths of four sea otters. The strain, first seen in
                    Canadian mountain lions in 1995, had not been previously
                    detected on the California coast."This was a complete
                    surprise," Karen Shapiro, with the UC Davis School of
                    Veterinary Medicine, said in a

                      >statement</a
                    >. "The COUG [toxoplasma strain] genotype has never before
                    been described in sea otters, nor anywhere in the California
                    coastal environment or in any other aquatic mammal or bird."

                  <p>
                    [...] Toxoplasma is often found in cat feces. Otters, which
                    live along the shoreline, can be exposed to the parasite in
                    rainwater runoff—all four cases scientists studied came in
                    during the heavy rainfall season.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Toxoplasmosis infection is common in sea otters—which have a
                    roughly 60 percent chance of being infected in their
                    lifetimes, Miller said—and can be fatal, but this strain is
                    of particular concern.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, Miller warned against unfairly demonizing cats.

                  <p>
                    "I don't want this to be a war on cats," she said. "I have
                    two cats. What I try to do is practice what I preach and
                    what I know as a scientist: I keep my cats indoors all the
                    time and I make sure to dispose of their litter into
                    something that will not leak into the environment."

                    implications, safety, and wisdom of allowing that to happen
                    have not yet fully been explored.

                      Aviation Administration license. A launch attempt this

                    SpaceX's own spaceport. Eventually, the company will launch
                    the rocket from a site under construction in the outer

                Many people believe that any and all opposition to the Covid
                vaccine comes from "far-right" Republican conspiracy theorists
                in the flyover states. I guess the Swiss government will now be
                branded with those labels as their Federal Office of Public
                Health is now recommending that a Covid vaccination is
                <b>not needed</b>, even for people at especially high risk. They
                list pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems
                as an exception. They further state that those who wish to
                receive a Covid vaccine must pay for it out of their own
                pockets.

                    In principle, no COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for
                    spring/summer 2023. Nearly everyone in Switzerland has been
                    vaccinated and/or contracted and recovered from COVID-19.
                    Their immune system has therefore been exposed to the
                    coronavirus. In spring/summer 2023, the virus will likely
                    circulate less. The current virus variants also cause rather
                    mild illness. For autumn 2023, the vaccination
                    recommendation will be evaluated again and adjusted
                    accordingly.

                    Gaming hardware manufacturer MSI confirmed today that it was
                    the victim of a cyberattack. In a
                    <a

                      >brief statement on its website</a
                    >, the company said that the attack hit "part of its
                    information systems," which have since returned to regular
                    operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company advises its customers only to get BIOS and
                    firmware updates from the MSI website and no other sources.
                    It's light on details, saying that after "detecting network
                    anomalies," MSI implemented "defense mechanisms and carried
                    out recovery measures," and then informed the the government
                    and law enforcement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The post doesn't mention if customer data was stolen
                    or affected. Tom's Hardware reached out to MSI but did not
                    hear back in time for publication. In addition, emails to
                    official spokesperson addresses listed on the company's
                    website bounced.

                    This kind of self-correction is a bedrock principle of the
                    scientific method. But the reality is that admitting errors
                    is hard for scientists to do, and it doesn't happen often.

                    [...] Correcting the fossil record puts the age of the rocks
                    back into contention. Because the rock formation doesn't
                    have any fossils from a known time period, dating it can be

                    business unit is partnering with the British chip design
                    firm <a href="https://www.arm.com/">Arm Ltd.</a> to enable
                    semiconductor designers to build low-power systems-on-chip
                    on its cutting-edge manufacturing process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The companies will initially focus on mobile SoC designs
                    before expanding the deal to cover chips for automotive,
                    internet of things, data center, aerospace and government
                    applications. Under the agreement, customers that use Arm's
                    designs as the basis of their chips will be able to use
                    Intel's 18A process technology to manufacture their
                    products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The deal is said to be a big boon for customers, since Intel
                    18A is a more advanced process with capacity in both the
                    U.S. and Europe. It will allow customers to design chips
                    using electronic design automation software from third-party
                    suppliers. EDA software is used by semiconductor engineers
                    to create processor blueprints. The result will be more
                    powerful processors with greater energy efficiency, Intel
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under the initiative, IFS and Arm will work together on
                    design technology co-optimization, wherein chip design and
                    process manufacturing are optimized to improve the power,
                    performance and cost of Arm-based cores using the Intel 18A
                    technology. Intel 18A is said to leverage two new
                    technologies, including PowerVia for optimal power delivery
                    and RibbonFET "gate all around" transistor architecture,
                    which ensures optimal performance and power.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As part of this cooperation, IFS and Arm plan to develop a
                    mobile reference design to demonstrate the technology to
                    customers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The deal is another key milestone for IFS, following its

                    with the Taiwanese semiconductor firm MediaTek Inc. that was
                    announced last July. Intel set up the foundry business in
                    2021 to manufacture chips for other companies based on their
                    own custom designs.

                    >. Like CDNs, DNS platforms are crucial services that ensure
                    that the Internet can function smoothly; they are not
                    involved with any of the sites that may be accessed as a
                    result of their services. In particular, they have no

                  <blockquote>

                      <p>
                        The court argues with the German law principle of
                        "interferer liability" the so-called "Stoererhaftung",
                        which allows holding uninvolved third parties liable for
                        an infringement if they have in some way adequately and
                        causally contributed to the infringement of a protected
                        legal interest. If DNS resolvers can be held liable as
                        interferers, this would set a dangerous precedent for
                        all services used in retrieving web pages. Providers of
                        browsers, operating systems or antivirus software could
                        be held liable as interferers on the same grounds if
                        they do not prevent the accessibility of
                        copyright-infringing websites.

                    That's unfortunate, since taken with the German court
                    rulings it is likely to encourage the copyright industry to
                    widen its attack on the Internet's plumbing, regardless of

                    Open source also paves the way for anyone, regardless of
                    their scientific background, to pitch in and help push
                    science forward. Many of these projects can benefit from
                    experienced software engineers, as software engineering
                    isn't always a strength for scientific researchers. "The
                    scientific community is trying to learn best software
                    development practices, but there's a lot to learn from
                    professional developers," says MIT's Peterson. "There are
                    lots of opportunities for experienced developers to help
                    build CI/CD pipelines, write unit tests, and generally help
                    create higher-quality codebases."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Contributing to a project's upstream dependencies is another
                    way to help out, LLNL's Peterson says. Merlin, for example,
                    relies heavily on the Python-based distributed task queue
                    <a href="https://github.com/celery/celery">Celery</a>. And,
                    like practically all open source projects, these need help
                    with documentation and bug reports. "We can never get enough
                    documentation, and not all of it needs to be written by
                    specialists," Gaston says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Opening repositories to specialists and non-specialists
                    alike for collaboration is a far cry from the
                    cloak-and-dagger image that the nuclear physics field
                    cultivated over the decades. But it's a big part of what
                    pushes science forward as creators gain valuable
                    contributions from outside their own organizations. "We have
                    hundreds of contributors at this point," says Permann, the
                    manager of the MOOSE project. "It's not just the National
                    Labs and universities either. Private companies are a little
                    more cautious about what they contribute to open source, but
                    they help out as well and there's a mutual benefit."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It also encourages the teams to write better code in the
                    first place. "We treat every pull request like it's a
                    submission to an academic journal," Kolev says. "When you
                    know your code is going to be scrutinized by other people,
                    it sets a higher bar."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Though secrecy still has its place, it takes openness to
                    keep moving forward.

                    [...] In Rondo's system, electricity travels through a
                    heating element, where it's transformed into heat. It's the
                    same mechanism that a toaster uses, O'Donnell says—just a
                    lot bigger and hotter. The heat then radiates through the
                    stack of bricks, warming them up to temperatures that can
                    reach over 1,500 °C (2,700 °F).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The insulated steel container housing the bricks can keep
                    them hot for hours or even days. When it's time to use the
                    trapped heat, fans blow air through the bricks. The air can
                    reach temperatures of up to 1,000 °C (1,800 °F) as it
                    travels through the gaps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    How the final heat then is used will depend on the
                    commercial process, O'Donnell says, though many facilities
                    will probably use it to turn water into high-pressure steam.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Rondo isn't alone in its quest to deploy heat
                    batteries in industry.
                    <a href="https://antoraenergy.com/">Antora Energy</a>, based
                    in California, is also building heat storage systems, using
                    carbon. "It's super simple—it's literally just solid
                    blocks," says cofounder and COO Justin Briggs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead of using a separate heating element (like Rondo's
                    "toaster coil") to turn electricity into heat, Antora's
                    system will use carbon blocks as a resistive heater, so
                    they'll both generate and store heat. This could cut down on
                    costs and complexity, Briggs explains. But the choice will
                    also mean the system needs to be carefully enclosed, since
                    graphite and other forms of carbon can degrade at high
                    temperatures in the air.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Even using commercially available materials, it'll
                    take a while for heat storage to prove its role to
                    manufacturers and make a meaningful dent in industrial
                    emissions. But the technology could be one building block of
                    a new, climate-friendly industrial sector. "We have all the
                    tools we need to transform to a zero-carbon economy,"
                    O'Donnell says. Now it's time to build them.

                    [...] Companies like OpenAI attempt to prevent their models
                    from doing bad things. But with the release of each new LLM,
                    social media sites buzz with new AI jailbreaks that evade
                    the new restrictions put in place by the AI's designers.
                    ChatGPT, and then Bing Chat, and then GPT-4 were all
                    jailbroken within minutes of their release, and in dozens of
                    different ways. Most protections against bad uses and
                    harmful output are only skin-deep, easily evaded by
                    determined users. Once a jailbreak is discovered, it usually
                    can be generalized, and the community of users pulls the LLM
                    open through the chinks in its armor. And the technology is
                    advancing too fast for anyone to fully understand how they
                    work, even the designers.

                    like a vast bendy straw. The finding suggests a new way for
                    galaxies to grow in the early universe, researchers report
                    in the March 31 <em>Science</em>.

                  <p>
                    Computer simulations predicted that streams of gas should
                    connect galaxies to the

                    (<em>SN: 3/6/23</em>). But astronomers expected that gas to
                    be warm, making it unsuitable for star-forming fuel and
                    galaxy growth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So astronomer Bjorn Emonts and his colleagues were surprised
                    to see a stream of cold, star-forming gas leading into the
                    Anthill Galaxy, a massive galaxy whose light takes 12
                    billion years to reach Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "People didn't think that these streams could get so
                    cold," says Emonts, of the National Radio Astronomy
                    Observatory in Charlottesville, Va.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But there, in the data, a frigid stream stretched at least
                    325,000 light-years away from the galaxy. The stream carries
                    the mass of 70 billion suns and deposits the equivalent of
                    about 450 suns in cold gas onto the galaxy every year, the
                    team calculated. That's enough to double the galaxy's mass
                    within a billion years.

                  <p>
                    [...] If other galaxies are fed by similar structures, it
                    could mean that early galaxies grew mostly by drinking
                    directly from the cosmic streams, rather than by the leading
                    hypothesis —

                    The Raspberry Pi Code editor isn't the only online Python
                    editor around by any stretch of the imagination as you can
                    also use a service such as
                    <a href="https://trinket.io/">Trinket.io</a>, which will let
                    you write Python code in one pane while previewing it in
                    another. However, what's interesting about Raspberry Pi's
                    tool is that the organization has a few Python tutorials
                    that are designed to be used with it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Raspberry Pi Foundation already had a nice set of Python
                    tutorials on its site, but it has adapted some of them to
                    open sample code directly in the online editor. For example,
                    when I tried the
                    <a
                      href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/hello-world-editor/1"
                      >"Say hello" lesson</a
                    >, the first link on the page opens the working set of code
                    in the editor in a new tab in my browser. When I revisited
                    the page and clicked the link a few minutes later, it took
                    me back to the same code I had edited before, because it
                    saved the lesson as a project that was associated with my
                    account.

                    The draft version contained data that showed that getting
                    COVID-19 posed a far greater risk of cardiac-related deaths
                    than that from mRNA vaccines. Specifically, the incidence of
                    cardiac-related deaths from infection was more than 10 times
                    higher than from the vaccine in people ages 18 to 24 and
                    more than five times higher for people 25 to 39. This data
                    is in line with

                    but was omitted entirely from the final analysis announced
                    by Ladapo.

                  <p>
                    Also omitted was a sensitivity analysis that showed that the
                    risk of cardiac-related deaths in young men was not
                    significant. The final version drew flak for not including a
                    sensitivity analysis, with the core conclusion of risk in
                    young men hinging on just 20 deaths. A sensitivity analysis
                    is a means to essentially evaluate the robustness of a
                    finding, and it was present in three versions of the draft
                    analysis but not in the final one.

                    [...] Overall, the draft versions of the analysis written by
                    state epidemiologists <em>supported</em> the use of mRNA.
                    "The risk associated with COVID-19 infection clearly
                    outweighs any potential risks associated with mRNA
                    vaccination," one version states.

                    Matt Hitchings, an infectious disease epidemiologist and
                    professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, who
                    also reviewed the drafts for the Times, told the outlet that
                    the excluded data was akin to academic dishonesty. "You can
                    call it a lie by omission," he said.

                    The core of the challenge here is that the paradigm has
                    changed. When you look at the first year of Ingenuity's
                    extended operations, we were still in the Three Forks area,
                    where the ground was flat. We could get line of sight from
                    the helicopter to the rover from hundreds and hundreds of
                    meters away. Our longest link that we established was 1.2
                    kilometers—a massive distance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And then we started to realize that the rover was going to
                    enter the river delta in like six months. It's going to
                    start climbing up through dozens and dozens of meters of
                    elevation change and passing through ravines, and that's
                    going to start presenting a telecom issue for us. We knew
                    that it couldn't be business as usual anymore—if we still
                    wanted to keep this helicopter mission going, not only did
                    we need to change the way we were operating, but we also had
                    to change the helicopter itself.

                    The records obtained by WIRED are more focused. They follow
                    a previously unreported directive to staff of the San
                    Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency handed down last
                    October to improve record keeping of incidents involving
                    autonomous vehicles. Muni, as the agency is known,
                    standardized the term "driverless car" when staff report
                    "near-misses, collisions or other incidents resulting in
                    transit delay," according to the directive. Agency logs show
                    12 "driverless" reports from September 2022 through March 8,
                    2023, though Muni video was provided for only eight of these
                    cases. Overall, the incidents resulted in at least 83
                    minutes of direct delays for Muni riders, records show.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That data likely doesn't reflect the true scale of the
                    problem. Muni staff don't follow every directive to the
                    letter, and a single delay can slow other lines, worsening
                    the blow. Buses and trains cannot weave around blockages as
                    easily as pedestrians, other motorists, and cyclists,
                    saddling transit-dependent travelers with some of the
                    biggest headaches caused by errant driverless cars,
                    according to transit advocates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That left the Muni driver in a bind. "I can't move the bus,"
                    the driver said to one of two riders on board. "The car is
                    automatic driving." The driver radioed managers and doffed
                    their cap: "Whoosh ... Half hour, one hour. I don't know.
                    Nothing to do." Thirty-eight stops and about five miles
                    remained ahead for the 54. The driver, looking out at the
                    Waymo, expressed disappointment: "This one not smart yet.
                    Not smart. Not good."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Waymo's Karp says one of the company's roadside assistance
                    crews arrived within 11 minutes of being dispatched to drive
                    the SUV, clearing the blockage about 15 minutes after it
                    began. Karp declined to elaborate on why the remote
                    responder's guidance failed but said engineers have since
                    introduced an unspecified change that allows addressing
                    "these rare situations faster and with more flexibility."
                  </p>

                      >Transport Workers Union</a
                    >, which represents Muni train and bus drivers, deferred
                    comment for this story to Muni. The agency declined to make
                    drivers described in this story available for comment. But
                    Tumlin, the Muni director, says San Francisco's transit
                    workers are frustrated. "When you encounter a vehicle with
                    no human on board, it is dispiriting and disempowering," he
                    says. "There's no one there to communicate with at all."

                    The processor supports 2P and 4P configurations; therefore,
                    Loongson has launched the 7A2000 bridge chip to manage the
                    communication between the processors and other components.
                    As per the chip designer, the 7A2000 is up to 400% faster
                    than the previous generation. Furthermore, with the help of
                    the 7A2000, there's a possibility to scale up to 128 cores
                    per motherboard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Loongson's provided numbers, the 3D5000 scores
                    over 425 points in SPEC CPU 2006, a depreciated benchmark
                    replaced with the newer SPEC CPU 2017 version. The 3D5000
                    also delivers over 1 TFLOPs of FP64 performance, up to 4X
                    higher than regular Arm cores. Meanwhile, the processor's
                    stream performance with eight channels of DDR4-3200 memory
                    crosses the 50GB mark.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While performance isn't the 3D5000's strong suit, security
                    is. The 32-core processor allegedly has a custom-made
                    mechanism to defend against vulnerabilities such as
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-performance-meltdown-spectre-intel-amd,5457-2.html"
                      >Meltdown or Spectre</a
                    >. The chip also has its Trusted Platform Module (TPM), so
                    it doesn't rely on an external solution. In addition,
                    according to MyDrivers' report, the 3D5000 also supports a
                    secret national algorithm with an embedded security module
                    that seemingly delivers excellent encryption and decryption
                    efficiency higher than 5 Gbps.

                    But many bitcoiners dispute the characterization of the
                    network as energy-guzzling and carbon intensive, saying that
                    mining is increasingly powered by renewable energy. And,
                    they say, PoS is inferior to PoW—prone to centralization
                    (crypto's great nemesis), concentrating influence and wealth
                    in the hands of the wealthy, without any mitigating forces,
                    like energy costs, pulling in the opposite direction. All of
                    this makes Shanghai a proxy battle over the future of
                    crypto.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to de Vries, it would be perfectly possible,
                    from a technical perspective, for Bitcoin to follow in the
                    footsteps of the Ethereum network. "Bitcoin could move to
                    PoS, no problem," he says. "But it's a social challenge."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The impasse is worsened by the ideological opposition
                    to PoS among bitcoiners, separate from the environmental
                    considerations. Some find unthinkable the idea of tampering
                    with Satoshi Nakamoto's original invention, and others, like
                    Bendiksen and Pritzker, believe PoS introduces greater risk
                    of centralization and censorship—and therefore represents a
                    threat to crypto's founding principles. "PoS is essentially
                    the fiat system," says Pritzker, "because whoever has the
                    gold makes the rules." For this reason, explains Bendiksen,
                    bitcoiners will "never agree" to a shift.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Any attack on bitcoin is an attack on their morality,
                    values, and often their net worth. This makes everything
                    feel personal," Von Wong told WIRED. "Because most people
                    don't see themselves as intrinsically bad, they feel
                    misjudged and misunderstood, which is a terrible place to
                    start a conversation."

                    When the team looked at data obtained shortly after the 2021
                    storm outbreak, they noticed a signal in northeastern
                    Arkansas. The feature was consistent with a roughly
                    60-kilometer-long track of wet soil. Tornadoes had been
                    previously reported in that area — outside the city of
                    Osceola — so it's likely that this feature was created by a
                    powerful storm, the team concluded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That makes sense, Kingfield says, and observations like
                    these can reveal tornado signatures that might otherwise be
                    missed. However, it's important to acknowledge that this new
                    technique works best in places where soils are capable of
                    retaining water, he says. "You need to have clay-rich
                    soils."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even so, these results hold promise for analyzing other
                    tornadoes, Kingfield says. It's always useful to have a new
                    tool for estimating the strength, path and structure of a
                    storm, but many storms go relatively unexamined simply
                    because of where and when they occur, he says. "Now we have
                    this new ground truth."

                    Of course, for the main intended purpose, 100baseT isn't
                    exactly a limitation here. Typical uses of the RUT-240
                    involve connecting it to an existing wired internet
                    connection via the WAN socket and passing that through to
                    another device connected to the LAN side, with the
                    possibility of routing traffic via 4G LTE if the wired WAN
                    connectivity fails. In these cases, even if the connection
                    between the existing devices was syncing at 1000baseT, (or
                    beyond), then unless our actual internet connection can
                    provide bandwidth in excess of 100 mbit then we don't really
                    lose anything in terms of raw speed. Technically, latency
                    might be worse, but the difference will be so small as to be
                    lost in the noise compared to the extra latency created by
                    the packet processing of the RUT-240.

                    The atmosphere thickened enough that it affected the newly
                    launched Starlink stations. They started to experience
                    atmospheric drag, which caused them to deorbit and burn up
                    on the way down. It was an expensive lesson in space weather
                    and provided people on Earth with a great view of what
                    happens when satellites fall back to Earth. It was also that
                    could have been avoided if they'd delayed their launch to
                    account for the ongoing threat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The loss of the Starlink satellites cost the company
                    millions of dollars. The company elected to launch, even
                    though the space weather community warned about the effects
                    of a geomagnetic storm. For years now, solar physicists have
                    been warning about the effects of space weather. Most
                    satellite companies pay attention to reports from such
                    places as the Space Weather Prediction Center. If they get
                    enough warning ahead of time, they can take steps to protect
                    their equipment. Astronauts on the ISS can take shelter
                    until the storm passes. And, power companies and others can
                    follow forecasts of such storms so they can take whatever
                    action is needed in the event of a strong event.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Solar physicists continue to study these solar outbursts in
                    hopes of coming up with a foolproof prediction system. At
                    the moment, when something erupts from the Sun, we get
                    notifications from a fleet of satellites. Those give us
                    minutes to hours of "heads-up" time to prepare for the
                    worst. NASA and other agencies continue to improve solar
                    studies and prediction methods so that companies launching
                    satellites to low-Earth orbit can take steps to protect
                    their investments.

                secretary-general and executive director Christophe Deloire and
                the others with him were denied entry. No other non-governmental
                agency has been able to meet with Assange in the last four years
                either.

                  <p>
                    <b>CHRISTOPHE DELOIRE</b>: So, what happened is that in the
                    past years we requested to be able to visit Julian in his
                    jail. We got an approval recently, which was confirmed on
                    March 21st with a number, an official number, for myself and
                    my colleague, Rebecca Vincent, and we were invited to come
                    to the prison.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And when we just arrived, the guy at the desk, when he saw
                    my passport, he suddenly was very stressed, and that taking
                    a paper on his office — on his desk, and that read it,
                    saying, "According to Article" — I do not remember the
                    number of the article, but according to this article, "you
                    are not allowed to visit Julian Assange. This is a decision
                    that has been made by the governor of the Belmarsh prison,
                    based on intelligence that we had" — I quote him — "that you
                    are journalists."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And it doesn't make sense at all, first, because,
                    personally, I've been a journalist since 1996, and we were
                    vetted, so it was never a mystery that I was a journalist,
                    never a secret. Second, my colleague wasn't a journalist
                    herself. And we came here not as journalists, but as
                    representatives of an international NGO with a constitutive
                    status in many international organizations. So it was really
                    as Reporters Without Borders representatives, not as
                    reporters covering the case. So, it doesn't make sense for
                    this second reason. And there is a third reason for which it
                    doesn't make sense, is that already two journalists, at
                    least, have been able to visit him in jail in the past four
                    years. So —

                    Attendees also wanted to know whether the sensors could
                    track how often they came into their offices and at what
                    time. "I'm in office [X]," Widder said. "The Mite knows that
                    it's recording something from office [X], and therefore
                    identifies me as an occupant of the office." Agarwal
                    responded that none of the analysis on the raw data would
                    attempt to match that data with specific people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At one point, Agarwal also mentioned that he had gotten
                    buy-in on the idea of using Mites sensors to monitor
                    cleaning staff—which some people in the audience interpreted
                    as facilitating algorithmic surveillance or, at the very
                    least, clearly demonstrating the unequal power dynamics at
                    play.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A sensor system that could be used to surveil workers
                    concerned Jay Aronson, a professor of science, technology,
                    and society in the history department and the founder of the
                    Center for Human Rights Science, who became aware of Mites
                    after Widder brought the project to his attention.
                    University staff like administrative and facilities workers
                    are more likely to be negatively impacted and less likely to
                    reap any benefits, said Aronson. "The harms and the benefits
                    are not equally distributed," he added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similarly, students and nontenured faculty seemingly had
                    very little to directly gain from the Mites project and
                    faced potential repercussions both from the data collection
                    itself and, they feared, from speaking up against it. We
                    spoke with five students in addition to Widder who felt
                    uncomfortable both with the research project and with
                    voicing their concerns.

                    [...] Because structural color can blanket an entire surface
                    with just a thin, ultralight layer, Chanda thinks this will
                    be a game changer—for airlines. A Boeing 747 needs about 500
                    kilograms of paint. He estimates that his paint could cover
                    the same area with 1.3 kilograms. That's more than 1,000
                    pounds shaved off each plane, which would reduce how much
                    fuel is needed per journey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Structural paint may also last longer. (Some airlines
                    repaint planes <a
                      href="https://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_05/textonly/fo01txt.html"
                      >every four years</a
                    >.) Pigment molecules break down in sunlight but structural
                    color doesn't—so it doesn't fade. "We have all these ways of
                    trying to fix pigment, to try to prevent it from oxidizing
                    and losing its color. Or it fades and we throw it in the
                    landfill," says Baumeister, who is also a cofounder of
                    consultancy <a href="https://biomimicry.net/who-we-are/"
                      >Biomimicry 3.8</a
                    >. "But when you need color to last forever—for the life of
                    the organism—structural color is preferred."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chanda's team also realized that, unlike conventional paint,
                    structural paint doesn't absorb infrared radiation, so it
                    doesn't trap heat. ("That's the reason your car gets hot in
                    the hot sun," he says.) The new paint is inherently <em
                      >cooling</em
                    >
                    in comparison: Based on the lab's preliminary experiments,
                    it can keep surfaces 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than
                    conventional paint.

                    The most surprising finding that emerged from the data was
                    the wide range of germline mutation rates. When the
                    researchers measured how often the mutations occurred per
                    generation, the species varied by only about fortyfold,
                    which Bergeron said seemed quite small compared to the
                    differences in body size, longevity and other traits. But
                    when they looked at the mutation rates per year rather than
                    per generation, the range increased to about 120-fold, which
                    was larger than previous studies had suggested.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study authors found that the higher the average
                    effective population size for a species, the lower its
                    mutation rate. That provided good evidence for the "<a
                      href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2010.05.003"
                      >drift-barrier hypothesis</a
                    >," which Lynch devised a little over a decade ago.
                    "Selection is relentlessly trying to reduce the mutation
                    rate because most mutations are deleterious," Lynch
                    explained. But in species with smaller effective population
                    sizes, natural selection gets weaker because genetic drift —
                    the effect of pure chance on the spread of a mutation — gets
                    stronger. That allows the mutation rate to rise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings also support another idea in the scientific
                    literature, the
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0959-437x(02)00354-4"
                      >male-driven evolution hypothesis</a
                    >, which proposes that males may contribute more mutations
                    to the evolution of some species than females do. Bergeron
                    and her colleagues found that germline mutation rates tended
                    to be higher for males than for females — at least in
                    mammals and birds, though not in reptiles and fish.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The authors noted a possible reason for those differences:
                    Because males in all species copy their DNA constantly to
                    make sperm, they face endless opportunities for mutations to
                    occur. Female fish and reptiles make eggs throughout their
                    lifetimes too, so they run a similar risk of genetic error.
                    But female mammals and birds are essentially born with all
                    the egg cells they will ever produce, so their germlines are
                    more protected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Harris commended the findings as an exciting start to
                    answering some of these big questions about what factors are
                    the most important determiners of mutation rate and thus
                    evolution. Beyond that, the study hints at just how much
                    biodiversity exists in nature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The diversity of life isn't just what animals look like,"
                    she said. There are "all these traits that you can't see,
                    and being able to observe it in studies like this just makes
                    biodiversity even more exciting."

                    from Meta, SAM is an image segmentation model that can
                    respond to text prompts or user clicks to isolate specific
                    objects within an image. Image segmentation is a process in
                    computer vision that involves dividing an image into
                    multiple segments or regions, each representing a specific
                    object or area of interest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The purpose of image segmentation is to make an image easier
                    to analyze or process. Meta also sees the technology as
                    being useful for understanding webpage content, augmented
                    reality applications, image editing, and aiding scientific
                    study by automatically localizing animals or objects to
                    track on video.

                    people are still suffering from long Covid, the mysterious
                    cocktail of symptoms that persist in some patients more than
                    12 weeks after an initial infection. Researchers are still
                    working to understand this illness, but it's been slow
                    progress so far.

                  <p>
                    This is because long Covid is not just a medical
                    problem—it's also a data problem, says Indra Joshi, director
                    of health, research, and artificial intelligence at
                    Palantir, which specializes in analyzing big data.

                  <p>
                    Before the pandemic, US hospitals kept their data to
                    themselves, Joshi told WIRED Health this March, making it
                    difficult for policymakers and researchers to identify
                    patterns of disease occurring across the country. That's why
                    Palantir worked with the US medical research agency, the
                    National Institutes of Health, to create what Joshi
                    describes as one of the <a

                    The National COVID Cohort Collaborative, <a

                      >aka N3C</a
                    >, is essentially a giant, collaborative database, enabling
                    clinicians and researchers to study the deidentified data of
                    people suffering from Covid-19 or related conditions. "If
                    you're diagnosed with Covid now, your data goes into this
                    enclave," says Joshi, explaining that N3C now includes 2.1
                    billion clinical observations. The data enclave also
                    encourages clinicians to enter data in a standardized
                    format, making it easy for their insights to be compared
                    with data collected from other US hospitals.

                  <p>
                    By harmonizing all this data, the N3C acts as a collective
                    pool of information that researchers can dip into to try to
                    find consensus on the ongoing mysteries of long Covid: What
                    exactly are the symptoms? What treatments are people
                    receiving? And how are they responding to those treatments?

                    While programmers today take division for granted, most
                    microprocessors in the 1970s could only add and subtract —
                    division required a slow and tedious loop implemented in
                    assembly code. One of the nice features of the Intel 8086
                    processor (1978) was that it provided machine instructions
                    for integer multiplication and division. Internally, the
                    8086 still performed a loop, but the loop was implemented in
                    microcode: faster and transparent to the programmer. Even
                    so, division was a slow operation, about 50 times slower
                    than addition.

                  <p>
                    I recently examined multiplication in the 8086, and now it's
                    time to look at the division microcode.1 (There's a lot of
                    overlap with the multiplication post so apologies for any
                    deja vu.)

                    TEMPO is not the first spacecraft to look at air quality.
                    NASA and NOAA already have multiple instruments in orbit
                    that gather pollution-related measurements. The difference
                    though, according to multiple NASA-affiliated researchers,
                    is that these other tools are trapped in low Earth orbit,
                    where they're limited. At LEO, other devices like the
                    <a href="https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/omi.html"
                      >Ozone Monitoring Instrument</a

                    can only capture one air quality reading per day per
                    location—and those readings come at a fixed time, which is a
                    big deficiency. Air quality fluctuates a lot throughout the
                    day (just think of the difference in polluting emissions
                    being pumped out during morning rush hour on a major highway
                    versus the early afternoon). Plus, these other devices tend
                    to capture their readings at a lower resolution, about 100
                    square miles, said

                    following commissioning, but Daugherty noted it could have a
                    much longer lifetime as its host satellite is expected to
                    last for 15 or more years. Plus, TEMPO was built for the

                    Assuming all goes well with this week's launch, the

                    June and begin its commissioning process after the
                    commercial satellite is set up. NASA expects it to begin
                    transmitting usable data beginning in October, which will be
                    verified and made publicly available starting about April

                    of bacteria. And there are countries where doctors have been
                    using them for decades. After World War I and a decade
                    before the first recognition of antibiotics, a self-taught
                    microbiologist named Félix d'Hérelle harnessed phages'
                    natural killing ability to cure dysentery in several
                    children in Paris. By the 1930s, he had found a research
                    home in what's now the Republic of Georgia. After Stalinism
                    closed the USSR off from Western Europe and the US, phage
                    research quietly flourished there.

                    It wasn't until the USSR collapsed in 1991 that phage

                    [...] In many ways, phages look like the solution to
                    problems that beset antibiotics. They each kill only one
                    type of bacteria, so they are less likely to disrupt
                    microbiomes. They penetrate complex matrices that defeat
                    antibiotics—not just the thick mucus caused by cystic

                    Australia's top spy agency has added to growing concerns
                    about a popular social media app, and its collection of
                    users' personal data. State governments across the nation
                    are issuing TikTok bans on official work devices as concerns
                    about data safety increase worldwide.

                  <p>
                    The app's Australian general manager Lee Hunter recently
                    told The Project that users should feel "safe" on TikTok,
                    and claimed China had no way of accessing data – despite the
                    site's parent company operating out of China.

                  <p>
                    However, national intelligence organisation Australian
                    Signals Directorate (ASD) recently released advice about the
                    app, warning the general public not to use it on a device
                    that can access other information.

                    information, for example, any workplace communication (email
                    clients, MS Teams)," the ASD warned in advice shared by the
                    Tasmanian government.

                    are the new way to gain unauthorized access to a vehicle.
                    Now, however, it seems that attackers have found a new way
                    to entirely bypass the electronic security on modern cars: A
                    method called CAN injection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The attack relies on a vehicle's CAN bus, the internal
                    computer network that keeps everything running. If you've
                    ever wondered how your car's engine, body control module,
                    and all the little controllers scattered around the car all
                    communicate, CAN bus is the answer. The system is universal
                    in modern cars, and even aftermarket ECU manufacturers now

                  <p>
                    The attack method Tindell lays out relies on physical access
                    to the car's CAN bus, meaning an attacker needs to get to
                    the data wires that run through your car. By tapping into
                    these wires, a thief can inject malicious commands into the
                    network — allowing the thief to wake up the car's computer
                    controllers, falsify the presence of the car key, and drive
                    off. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This attack isn't the easiest to pull off, given that
                    it requires a thief to partially disassemble the target car,
                    but it's powerful when done correctly — entirely bypassing
                    the car's key, unlike relay attacks that simply extend the
                    key's radio range.

                    A team of physicists has recreated a classic experiment in
                    particle physics with a dimensional twist, by performing it
                    in time instead of just space. In the process, they
                    showcased the utility of a unique material for future
                    experiments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers redesigned the double-slit experiment, which
                    was first performed in 1801 and demonstrated a curious trait
                    of light: that it can behave both as a particle and a wave.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The original experiment tested how light moved through
                    space; the recent rendition tested how light would travel if
                    it was only allowed to at specific times. Details of the
                    team's work are
                    <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41567-023-01993-w"
                      >published</a
                    >
                    today in <em>Nature Physics</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the traditional experiment, a beam of light is
                    projected at a barrier, behind which is a photosensitive
                    detector. The barrier has two parallel slits. If you threw
                    ordinary matter at the barrier, they would roughly form the
                    same shape as the slits on the detector. But when light is
                    cast on the slits, it splits into two waves that pass
                    through the barrier and intersect on the other side.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the new work, the researchers made one big change:
                    They swapped out an ordinary screen with two slits for an
                    indium-tin-oxide film—the same material that is used in
                    modern phone screens. (It's actually a metamaterial, or a
                    material not found in nature, that is
                    <a
                      href="https://gizmodo.com/new-noise-blocking-material-could-make-jets-and-drones-1833229326"
                      >engineered to behave a certain way</a
                    >.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers changed the reflectance of the screen using
                    ultrafast lasers, which only allowed light through at
                    specific times, quadrillionths of a second apart. Basically,
                    they built a quantum tollbooth, using the lasers to create
                    time-dependent slits in the barrier. Even when they only
                    allowed one photon through the screen, the light produced an
                    interference pattern.

                    Samsung Electronics Co. said it's cutting memory chip
                    production after reporting its slimmest profit since the
                    2009 financial crisis, a significant step toward ending a
                    supply glut that had cratered prices across the industry.

                  <p>
                    [...] Operating profit at the world's largest maker of
                    memory chips plunged more than 95% to 600 billion won ($450
                    million) for the three months ended March, missing the
                    average analyst estimate of 1.4 trillion won. Sales fell 19%
                    to 63 trillion won.

                  <p>
                    [...] South Korea's largest company had resisted pulling
                    back despite the downturn, in part to grab market share from
                    rivals SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology Inc., which have
                    been forced to cut output.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Samsung's shares rose as much as 4.7% in the highest
                    intraday jump in three months. Hynix shares surged as much
                    as 6.7%. [...] The company had warned that earnings would
                    fall in the first quarter on slowing sales. But memory
                    prices tumbled more than anticipated because of sluggish
                    demand for a wide range of electronics from smartphones to
                    PCs, as consumers and companies navigated recession risks.
                    Despite its post-Covid re-opening, China's market has also
                    not bounced back as quickly as some anticipated. Samsung is
                    estimated to have lost about $3 billion in its memory chip
                    division.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Prices of DRAM - a type of memory used to process data
                    - are expected to fall in the current quarter by around 10%,
                    according to Yuanta's Baik. That follows a roughly 20% slide
                    in the previous three months and a more than 30% drop in the
                    fourth quarter of last year. [...] Inventory at Samsung had
                    swelled to 52.2 trillion won at the end of last year after
                    the company maintained production despite a collapse in
                    demand. The existing high inventory will take time to
                    digest, said TrendForce Senior Vice President Avril Wu.
                    "Slower-than-expected demand in the second half of 2023 will
                    prolong the time required for inventory to get back to
                    normal levels."
