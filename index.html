                <div>
                  <p>
                    Reddit said Wednesday that the platform is revamping its
                    privacy settings with an aim to make ad personalization and
                    account visibility toggles consistent. Most notably though,
                    it is removing the ability to opt out of ad personalization
                    based on Reddit activity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company said that it will still have opt-out controls in
                    "select countries" without specifying which ones. It
                    mentioned in a blog post that users won't see more ads but
                    they will see better-targeted ads following this change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Reddit requires very little personal information, and we
                    like it that way. Our advertisers instead rely on
                    on-platform activity—what communities you join, leave,
                    upvotes, downvotes, and other signals—to get an idea of what
                    you might be interested in," Reddit
                    <a
                      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/16tqihd/settings_updateschanges_to_ad_personalization/"

                  <p>
                    The company is essentially removing the option to not track
                    you based on whatever you do on Reddit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The company noted that ad-limiting controls will
                    possibly show you fewer ads from mentioned categories if the
                    toggles are turned off, but won't possibly filter out all
                    ads. Reddit justified this by saying it uses manual tagging
                    and machine learning to label ads, so there is a chance that
                    it is not 100% accurate.

                    Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella warned on Monday of a

                    is allowed to continue, a situation, he said, that starts
                    with searches on desktop and mobile but extends to the
                    emerging battleground of artificial intelligence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nadella testified on Monday as part of the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/12/tech/google-antitrust-lawsuit-government-trial-duplicate-2/index.html"
                      >US government's sweeping antitrust trial</a
                    >
                    against Google, now into its 14th day. He is the most senior
                    tech executive yet to testify during the trial that focuses
                    on the power of Google as the default search engine on
                    mobile devices and browsers around the globe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] even more worrisome, Nadella argued, is that the
                    enormous amount of search data that is provided to Google
                    through its default agreements can help Google train its AI
                    models to be better than anyone else's — threatening to give
                    Google an unassailable advantage in generative AI that would
                    further entrench its power.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In addition to training its models on search queries,
                    Google has also been moving to secure agreements with
                    content publishers to ensure that it has exclusive access to
                    their material for AI training purposes, according the
                    Microsoft CEO. In Nadella's own meetings with publishers, he
                    said that he now hears that Google "wants ... to write this
                    check and we want you to match it." (Google didn't
                    immediately respond to questions about those deals.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The requests highlight concerns that "what is publicly
                    available today [may not be] publicly available tomorrow"
                    for AI training, according to the testimony.

                    Another problem is the semantic difference that occurs when
                    developers install open source outside of distros and
                    package databases. Modern security scanners all rely on this
                    metadata, so security vulnerabilities go undetected for open
                    source that is installed outside of the distro or package
                    database.

                    [...] We’ve seen great progress the past few years in better
                    establishing the security of open source projects. From the
                    previously mentioned SSDF framework, to Sigstore and SLSA,
                    multiple complementary projects have created developer
                    toolchains for establishing where open source comes from,
                    whether it has been tampered with, and other more reliable
                    trust signals. This range of concerns is frequently referred
                    to as “provenance,” and these open source projects have been
                    aggressively baked into the major programming language
                    registries such as npm, Maven and PyPi, as well as
                    Kubernetes itself supporting software signing with Sigstore.

                      >Wolfi</a
                    >, an open source distro created and maintained by
                    Chainguard, whose founders were cocreators of Sigstore and
                    SLSA. Wolfi strips down the distro to its most essential
                    components and introduces a novel rolling-release cadence so
                    that only updated packages are available for download, and
                    developers no longer need to download open source software
                    outside of the distro.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This distro seeks to clear out all the nonessential packages
                    so that when you see a CVE or CVSS score, you know it is a
                    real vulnerability and don’t miss out on false negatives.
                    With less code, fewer bugs, and fewer vulnerabilities, this
                    slim-down of the distro also lets Wolfi give its users more
                    severity-level data CVSS scores, plus support for new
                    versions of open source software packages. On its one-year
                    anniversary, Wolfi supports 1,300 package configurations and
                    has gained the support of scanners from the major container
                    security players such as Docker Scout, Grype, Snyk, Trivy,
                    Wiz, and Prisma Cloud.

                    “Open source used to mean that you get a free copy of that
                    source code forever,” says Lorenc. “Software doesn’t work
                    like that anymore. You need a plan to constantly update
                    every piece of software because of the rate of
                    vulnerabilities being found. Software expires, and this is
                    no longer a static problem, it’s dynamic.”

              <p>
                Just like you could previously modify your robots.txt file to
                not be included in Googles webcrawling you are now supposed to
                be able to opt out of being used as language model fodder for
                their AI. So adding those two lines should apparently do the
                trick. No word on if other models will adhere to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                No word on if they will remove content already gathered, don't
                bet on it, or how this will be punished in the future. The
                current claim is that it will not effect ranking in the search
                engine. But that could always change.
              </p>
              <p>
                I like how they phrase it as you "help these AI models" and by
                then opting out of that you are not being helpful or nice. You
                help and they reap all the rewards of your work, that sounds
                like a good deal .. right!?

                    In a time of income inequality and ruthless politics, people
                    with outsized power or an unrelenting willingness to
                    browbeat others often seem to come out ahead.

                  <p>
                    New research from Dartmouth, however, shows that being
                    uncooperative can help people on the weaker side of a power
                    dynamic achieve a more equal outcome—and even inflict some
                    loss on their abusive counterpart.

                    theory as "zero-determinant strategies" developed by
                    renowned scientists William Press, now at the University of
                    Texas at Austin, and the late Freeman Dyson at the Institute

                  <p>
                    Zero-determinant strategies dictate that "extortionists"
                    control situations to their advantage by becoming less and
                    less cooperative—though just cooperative enough to keep the
                    other party engaged—and by never being the first to concede
                    when there's a stalemate. Theoretically, they will always
                    outperform their opponent by demanding and receiving a
                    larger share of what's at stake.

                  <p>
                    [...] "Unbending players who choose not to be extorted can
                    resist by refusing to fully cooperate. They also give up
                    part of their own payoff, but the extortioner loses even
                    more," says Chen, who is now an assistant professor at the
                    Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our work shows that when an extortioner is faced with an
                    unbending player, their best response is to offer a fair
                    split, thereby guaranteeing an equal payoff for both
                    parties," she says. "In other words, fairness and
                    cooperation can be cultivated and enforced by unbending
                    players."

                    [...] "The empirical evidence to date suggests that people
                    do engage in these extortionate behaviors, especially in
                    asymmetric situations, and that the extorted party often
                    tries to resist it, which is then costly to both parties,"

                <div>
                  <p>
                    [...] Well before Quesst, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works—its
                    legendary advanced aerospace design group—had already been
                    working on what would eventually become the X-59. Back in
                    2013, the plane was known as C100, and it looked a little
                    bit like a shorter version of the Concorde with the engine
                    right on its back, splitting a V-shaped tail.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Through all of these iterations, Richardson and his
                    team learned a few important lessons about designing for
                    supersonic boom. First, the heavy, bulky parts of the plane
                    needed to be as far back as possible. "We really put nothing
                    out in the front, but we want to have that long, fine
                    ratio," he says. This resulted in an extremely fine nose and
                    body, with no surface interruptions that can produce noise
                    when the plane breaks the sound barrier. "You want to be
                    able to stretch out and manage the different shocks across
                    the length of the airplane," he adds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They also learned that anything that causes discontinuity in
                    the airplane's shape—for instance a windshield or canopy—can
                    add to the boom effect. This led them to get rid of the
                    windshield altogether. Instead, the X-59 uses an external
                    vision system, which is the only advanced technology in the
                    plane, according to Richardson. The pilot navigates using a
                    camera, viewing the outside through a large display. This
                    system had to undergo rigorous certification by the Federal
                    Aviation Administration for use in the national airspace.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite their best efforts to create a streamlined body, the
                    team found that bulges were inevitable. Richardson describes
                    how the inlet for the engine was placed on top of the plane
                    so the shock that's generated goes up into space rather than
                    down to the ground. (This is what happened with the
                    Concorde's engines, which were under its wings.) The same
                    thing goes for any actuators, whose position on top will
                    send shocks up instead of down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The X-59 has been designed to manage and distribute
                    shockwaves differently from the very start while also flying
                    at slower speeds than the Concorde (the Concorde's cruising
                    speed was 1,350 mph, while the X-59 will cruise at around
                    925 mph). "I think most people look at the airplane and they
                    say, 'Wait, something's wrong,'" Richardson says. "[They
                    think]
                    <em
                      >it's too long. The landing gear is too far in the back.
                      And why is the nose so long?</em
                    >"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "I think the biggest challenge that anybody who would
                    go and develop one of these airliners would have is finding
                    an engine that would fly at Mach 1.8 without an afterburner
                    and be large enough for an airplane of this size,"
                    Richardson says, but noting that it is doable.

                    <em>Kerbal Space Program</em> is aggregated for all reviews
                    as "Overwhelmingly Positive," while KSP2 is "Mixed" for all
                    reviews, and "Mostly Negative" for 342 recent reviews, as of
                    this writing. We will see whether this kind of feedback
                    helps shape the game for its final release.

                    TechCrunch has confirmed in our own tests that an option on

                    appears for users with an IP address located in the US,
                    Australia, Brazil or Spain — which were some of the earliest
                    markets to get the ability to report political
                    misinformation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead users who click on the "report post" option in the
                    drop-down menu attached to each post (i.e. tweet) are
                    presented with options to make reports for the following
                    reasons: Hate; abuse &amp; harassment; violent speech; child
                    safety; privacy; spam; suicide or self harm; sensitive or

                    on account impersonation, including of brands, so looks
                    ill-suited to reporting other types of political

                    The WEA test will play out on consumer cellular phones that
                    are turned on, within range of an active tower, and whose
                    provider participates in WEA testing. The test text message
                    will read, "THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless
                    Emergency Alert System. No action is needed."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A translated version of the text message will be displayed
                    on devices with Spanish set as their primary language and
                    will state the following: "ESTA ES UNA PRUEBA del Sistema
                    Nacional de Alerta de Emergencia. No se necesita acción."
                    The message will be broadcast for approximately 30 minutes,
                    we are told.

                  <p>
                    WEA messages are free and do not count against texting
                    limits on metered plans. There is no way to opt out of the
                    test, and you will apparently receive an audible alert even
                    if your device is on silent mode.

                    WEA alerts are accompanied by a unique tone and vibration as
                    to ensure they are accessible to the entire public,
                    including those with disabilities. They are reserved for
                    federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal governments
                    and are sent to participating wireless providers, who pass
                    them along to devices in geo-targeted regions.

                    The ESA test, meanwhile, will run for approximately one
                    minute and be conducted in cooperation with television and
                    radio broadcasters as well as over cable systems, weather
                    radios, and via satellite radio. The message seen on these
                    platforms will resemble familiar monthly ESA test messages,
                    and will be be served as a common alerting protocol (CAP)
                    message via the Integrated Public Alert and Warning

                    The public tests can be a minor inconvenience but are a
                    necessary evil to ensure that emergency alert services are
                    operating as intended in the event of a true emergency. A
                    backup date of October 11 is also in place should widespread
                    severe weather or other significant events occur on October
                    4.

                    Nissan will accelerate plans towards electrification by
                    committing that all vehicles sold in Europe will be electric
                    by 2030.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The announcement comes despite the UK postponing its 2030
                    ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2035.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nissan's boss said the firm's move was "the right thing to
                    do".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Car trade body the SMMT has voiced concerns that the
                    postponement of the ban would see consumers delay the switch
                    to electric vehicles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nissan will also introduce new battery technology by the end
                    of the decade that it said will reduce both the charging
                    time and cost of electric vehicles (EVs).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Nissan will make the switch to full electric by 2030 in
                    Europe. We believe it is the right thing to do for our
                    business, our customers and for the planet," said Nissan's
                    chief executive Makoto Uchida.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an interview with the BBC, Mr Uchida said the company was
                    aiming to bring down the cost of electric vehicles for
                    customers, so that they were no more expensive than petrol
                    and diesel cars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It may take a bit of time, but we are looking at the next
                    few years," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are looking at it from the point of view of the
                    technology, from the point of view of cooperating with
                    suppliers, and of course working with the government on how
                    we can deliver that kind of cost competitiveness to the
                    consumer," Mr Uchida added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Will that price parity happen by 2030? "That's what we're
                    aiming for," confirmed Mr Uchida.

                    crossed the U.S. Southwest on May 20, 2012, this one will be

                    During an annular solar eclipse, the moon appears slightly
                    smaller than the sun, so it can't block the entire disk. The
                    result is a beautiful "ring of fire." Here's everything you

                disappeared off our screens. We are looking into the cause but I

                    The rise of virtual artificial intelligence (AI) girlfriends
                    is enabling the silent epidemic of loneliness in an entire
                    generation of young men. It is also having severe

              <p>
                Interesting how this becomes a man problem, and not a woman
                problem. The blame here is entirely shifted towards the male of
                the species. While women are somehow innocent victims, as per
                usual. Are there no AI boyfriends, there are. They just don't
                seem to be problematic. Which is odd.

                    COVID-19 finally burst this 40-year bubble. During pandemic
                    lockdowns, many people worked from home and became
                    comfortable with virtual meetings. Telecommuting grew as
                    conventional commuting declined. Workers with the resources

                    Like many U.S. cities, Portland, Oregon, is losing downtown
                    businesses. This is cutting into urban revenues and creating

                    There are significant knock-on effects. A range of

                    services, rely on downtown office workers.

                    form of the United States, with people and money flowing to
                    Main Street stores through the 1960s, then to suburban malls
                    in the 1970s and 80s, then

                    The diversity of yeast species in Japan reflects the
                    latitudinal range of the Japanese archipelago. Shiga
                    prefecture's diverse biomes—hydrosphere, forests, and arable
                    land—and highly variable climate encourage this diversity.
                    Tanimura promotes continuing efforts to search for new
                    microbial resources in unexplored areas.

                    [...] At publication, approximately 160 species were
                    reported as oleaginous yeast, producing more than 20% of
                    their dry cell weight as lipids.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    Trilobites first appear early in the Cambrian and are one of
                    the earliest examples of arthropods, the group that includes
                    all insects. They flourished for over 100 million years,
                    leaving fossils that are seemingly ubiquitous—we've
                    described over 20,000 different trilobite species. That's
                    over three times the number of mammalian species we're aware
                    of.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite all those fossils, however, we've never found one
                    with a meal inside it. We've been able to infer what some of
                    them were likely to have been dining on based on their
                    appearance and the ecosystems they were found in, but we
                    haven't been able to establish what they ate with certainty.
                    But today, researchers are describing an exquisitely
                    preserved sample that includes several of the animal's last
                    meals, which suggests that this particular animal was a bit
                    like an aquatic vacuum cleaner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The one caution the researchers raise about this find
                    is that the feeding behavior of the trilobite may not be
                    entirely normal. There's a discontinuity in the animal's
                    shell between two of its segments, which can be an
                    indication that it's getting ready to molt. If that's the
                    case, the animal may have been overeating to generate
                    additional pressure to help it break out of its old shell.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, after tens of thousands of trilobite fossils, we finally
                    have one with food inside of it. Yet it seems to be from a
                    species that had a bizarre feeding pattern, and this
                    particular individual may have been sucking down more food
                    than usual. So, we'll probably need to find a few more of
                    these to get a better picture of what trilobites ate.

                    The exosuit could prove a useful tool for athletes looking
                    to speed up during training. "Although this is a preliminary
                    study, we can say the exosuit can augment the human ability
                    to run," says Giuk Lee, an associate professor at Chung-Ang
                    University in Seoul, South Korea, who led the research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lee and his team built a lightweight exosuit with steel
                    cables powered by electrical motors attached to the runner's
                    thighs. The motors pull the cables, mimicking the
                    contraction of muscles. The exosuit helps people run faster
                    by assisting their hip extension—the powerful motion that
                    propels a runner forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The exosuit tracks the wearer's lower-body movements in real
                    time through sensors on both thighs. This data feeds into an
                    algorithm designed to monitor gait, which works in tandem
                    with other algorithms to track each runner's individual
                    running style and speed.

                    Hackers backed by the Chinese government are planting
                    malware into routers that provides long-lasting and
                    undetectable backdoor access to the networks of
                    multinational companies in the US and Japan, governments in
                    both countries said Wednesday.

                    The hacking group, tracked under names including BlackTech,
                    Palmerworm, Temp.Overboard, Circuit Panda, and Radio Panda,
                    has been operating since at least 2010, a joint advisory
                    published by government entities in the US and Japan
                    reported. The group has a history of targeting public
                    organizations and private companies in the US and East Asia.
                    The threat actor is somehow gaining administrator
                    credentials to network devices used by subsidiaries and
                    using that control to install malicious firmware that can be
                    triggered with "magic packets" to perform specific tasks.

                  <p>
                    The hackers then use control of those devices to infiltrate
                    networks of companies that have trusted relationships with
                    the breached subsidiaries.

                    target network and gaining administrator access to network
                    edge devices, BlackTech cyber actors often modify the
                    firmware to hide their activity across the edge devices to
                    further maintain persistence in the network," officials
                    wrote in Wednesday's advisory. "To extend their foothold
                    across an organization, BlackTech actors target branch
                    routers—typically smaller appliances used at remote branch
                    offices to connect to a corporate headquarters—and then
                    abuse the trusted relationship of the branch routers within
                    the corporate network being targeted. BlackTech actors then
                    use the compromised public-facing branch routers as part of
                    their infrastructure for proxying traffic, blending in with
                    corporate network traffic, and pivoting to other victims on
                    the same corporate network."

                    [...] To install their modified bootloader, the US and
                    Japanese advisory said, the threat actors install an older
                    version of the legitimate firmware and then modify it as it
                    runs in memory. The technique overrides signature checks in
                    the Cisco ROM monitor signature validation functions,
                    specifically functions of Cisco's IOS Image Load test and
                    the Field Upgradeable ROMMON Integrity test. The modified
                    firmware, which consists of a Cisco IOS loader that installs
                    an embedded IOS image, allows the compromised routers to
                    make connections over SSH without being recorded in event
                    logs.

                    big players in the dairy industry are again putting the

                A lot of academic research is funded from government grants from
                agencies like NSF. For grants that have already been approved,
                universities can continue to conduct research. However, the
                shutdown will halt the review and approval of new grants. The
                same article from <i>Nature</i> reports:
              </p>
              <p>
                The US National Science Foundation (NSF), expects to halt work
                for 1,487 out of its 1,946 employees, once short-term funding
                runs out, for example. Scientists can continue to submit
                applications for funding to the agency, which pays for about
                one-quarter of the taxpayer-supported basic research in the
                United States, but no new projects will be approved. The
                Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the US
                National Institutes of Health, a significant funder of
                biomedical research, plans to furlough some 37,325 people — 42%
                of its staff — by the second day of a shutdown. 'Essential'
                staff working at its clinical centre or on public-safety
                missions such as monitoring for viral outbreaks will continue to
                report to work.

                  >article in <i>Science</i></a
                >
                states that many clinical trials supported by the National
                Institutes of Health (NIH) will be affected:

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    NIH was mostly spared in the last shutdown because its
                    budget had already been approved by Congress, but this time
                    it will feel the impact. A subset of its nearly 19,800
                    employees—just 4427, or 22%—will remain on duty to care for
                    patients at the NIH Clinical Center and maintain research
                    animals and cell lines for labs in the agency's intramural
                    research program. No new patients will be enrolled in trials
                    unless their illness is life threatening. The agency also
                    expects to keep open PubMed, which holds biomedical research
                    abstracts needed for health care, and the ClinicalTrials.gov
                    registry, where reporting of clinical studies is a legal
                    requirement.

              <p>
                However, the <i>Science</i> article notes that some astronomy
                research will continue to be conducted during the shutdown due
                to leftover funds from the current fiscal year or other external
                funding:

                    As for research infrastructure that NSF supports, a small
                    number of employees deemed essential will continue to
                    provide support for research programs in the Arctic and
                    Antarctic. And many NSF-funded telescopes should be able to
                    remain open for an extended period thanks to extra funding
                    the agency provided this year to tide them over in case of a
                    shutdown. Most of the optical telescopes are managed for NSF
                    by a nongovernmental organization, the Association of
                    Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). It has
                    "sufficient financial resources to maintain our functional
                    and research activities for a reasonable length of time," an
                    AURA spokesperson told ScienceInsider.

                    university coalition, "We are doing exactly nothing special
                    to prepare for the shutdown," Director Tony Beasley says.
                    That contrasts with the government shutdown of 2013, when
                    NRAO was forced to switch off its U.S.-based facilities
                    after just a few days.

                Other agencies will continue to provide services that are deemed
                essential but will cease other operations. For example,
                <a
                  href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/home/article/shutdown-nws-forecasts-impact-18395688.php"

                  and warnings</a
                >
                but research to improve weather forecasts will be halted during
                a shutdown. As in the 2019 government shutdown,
                <a
                  href="https://www.npr.org/2019/01/18/686451007/how-the-government-shutdown-is-affecting-weather-forecasts"

                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                In summary, the looming government shutdown will not halt
                science-related activities that are deemed necessary to
                imminently protecting life and property, such as issuing weather
                warnings. However, the employees who provide those services will
                not get paid until after the government shutdown ends. For
                agencies that do not have supplemental funds available,
                scientific research will generally be halted.

                  <p>Bing Chat responses infiltrated by ads pushing malware</p>
                  <p>
                    Malicious advertisements are now being injected into
                    Microsoft's AI-powered Bing Chat responses, promoting fake
                    download sites that distribute malware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bing Chat, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 engine, was introduced
                    by Microsoft in February 2023 to challenge Google's
                    dominance in the search industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By offering users an interactive chat-based experience
                    instead of the traditional search query and result format,
                    Bing Chat aimed to make online searches more intuitive and
                    user-friendly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In March, Microsoft began injecting ads into Bing Chat
                    conversations to generate revenue from this new platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, incorporating ads into Bing Chat has opened the
                    door to threat actors, who
                    <a
                      href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-access-brokers-use-google-ads-to-breach-your-network/"

                      href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-abuse-google-ads-to-spread-malware-in-legit-software/"

                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, conversing with AI-powered chat tools can
                    instill unwarranted trust, potentially convincing users to
                    click on ads, which isn't the case when skimming through
                    impersonal search results.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This conversation-like interaction can imbue AI-provided
                    URLs with a misplaced sense of authority and
                    trustworthiness, so the existing problem of malvertizing in
                    search platforms is amplified by the introduction of AI
                    assistants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fact that these ads are labeled as promoted results when
                    the user hovers over a link in Bing Chat conversations is
                    likely too weak of a measure to mitigate the risk.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The display of malvertising within Bing Chat
                    conversations highlights the expanding frontier of cyber
                    threats and makes it crucial for users to be wary of chatbot
                    results and always double-check URLs before downloading
                    anything.

                    Starting on November 1st, Disney Plus will begin restricting
                    password sharing. In Canada.

                    The company announced the change in an email sent to
                    Canadian subscribers. Disney has not provided many details
                    on how it plans to enforce this policy — its email merely
                    states that "we're implementing restrictions on your ability
                    to share your account or login credentials outside of your
                    household." The announcement reads more like a strong finger
                    wag than anything else. "You may not share your subscription
                    outside of your household," reads the company's updated Help
                    Center.

                    lead to account limits or termination.

                    exploring" ways to address shared accounts. Iger said that a
                    "significant" number of people are currently sharing
                    passwords across Disney's services and added that Disney has
                    the "technical capability" to monitor sign-ins.

                    Disney Plus is just the latest streaming service to attempt
                    to tackle password sharing. Netflix has been testing such

                      >May 2023</a
                    >. Netflix accounts are restricted based on a user's IP
                    address; subscribers, depending on the plan they select,
                    have the option of adding additional members to their
                    accounts for an additional fee. The company said in its Q2
                    earnings call that its policy has driven more subscribers to
                    the service.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But hey, if it's any consolation: Canadian users now have
                    access to the cheaper ad-supported tier. This next turn in
                    the streaming wars is going to get pricey.

                    A similar gap was identified in the 'Allowlist Cloudflare IP

                    connections originating from outside Cloudflare's IP ranges,

                    "An attacker can establish a custom domain with Cloudflare,

                    they disable all protection features for that custom domain
                    and route their attack(s) through Cloudflare's

                    Certitude says it reported the issues through Cloudflare's

                    even as she insisted she remained a robust public servant,
                    despite her hospitalizations, reports of episodes of
                    confusion and other issues.

                    In announcing earlier this year that she planned to retire
                    at the end of her latest term, in 2025, Feinstein said:
                    "Each of us was sent here to solve problems. That's what
                    I've done for the last 30 years, and that's what I plan to
                    do for the next two years. My thanks to the people of
                    California for allowing me to serve them."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fellow Democrat, will now
                    appoint someone to serve out the remainder of Feinstein's
                    term, ahead of the 2024 race to succeed her. He has
                    committed to naming a Black woman -- who would then be only
                    the third such senator in history -- but has also said he
                    will not pick any of the candidates in the current
                    Democratic primary race, which includes Rep. Barbara Lee.

                    On Monday, OpenAI
                    <a
                      href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak"

                    a significant update to ChatGPT that enables its GPT-3.5 and
                    GPT-4 AI models to analyze images and react to them as part
                    of a text conversation. Also, the ChatGPT mobile app will
                    add speech synthesis options that, when paired with its
                    existing speech recognition features, will enable fully
                    verbal conversations with the AI assistant, OpenAI says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    OpenAI is planning to roll out these features in ChatGPT to
                    Plus and Enterprise subscribers "over the next two weeks."
                    It also notes that speech synthesis is coming to iOS and
                    Android only, and image recognition will be available on
                    both the web interface and the mobile apps.<br />[...]<br />Despite
                    their drawbacks, in marketing materials, OpenAI is billing
                    these new features as giving ChatGPT the ability to "see,
                    hear, and speak." Not everyone is happy about the
                    anthropomorphism and potential hype language involved. On X,
                    Hugging Face AI researcher Dr. Sasha Luccioni
                    <a
                      href="https://x.com/SashaMTL/status/1706302354528555283?s=20"
                      >posted</a
                    >, "The always and forever PSA: stop treating AI models like
                    humans. No, ChatGPT cannot 'see, hear and speak.' It can be
                    integrated with sensors that will feed it information in
                    different modalities."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While ChatGPT and its associated AI models are clearly not
                    human—and hype is a very real thing in marketing—if the
                    updates perform as shown, they potentially represent a
                    significant expansion in capabilities for OpenAI's computer
                    assistant.

                    At CERN, an experiment investigated how gravity acts on
                    antimatter. General relativity predicts that all matter
                    follows gravitational attraction. However, recent decades in
                    cosmology raised enough questions about our understanding of
                    gravity. So, investigating the behavior of exotic matter is
                    necessary to confirm predictions from general relativity.
                    Antimatter has been available for quite a while; the first
                    positrons were created in 1932. Yet, measuring the effect of
                    gravity on charged particles is very difficult.
                    Gravitational force is much weaker than electromagnetic
                    force. The research team used anti-hydrogen (electrically
                    neutral) to observe the effect of gravity. And yes,
                    antihydrogen falls down.

                Amazon is limiting the number of books that authors can
                self-publish on its site to three a day, after an influx of
                suspected AI-generated material was listed for sale in recent
                months.
              </p>

                <div>
                  <p>
                    The post stated that Amazon is "actively monitoring the
                    rapid evolution of generative AI and the impact it is having
                    on reading, writing, and publishing" and that "very few"
                    publishers will be affected by the change. Authors and
                    publishers will also have the option to seek an exception to
                    the rule.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rule change will "probably not" be a "gamechanger for
                    managing the influx of AI-written content on Amazon's
                    platform," said Dr Miriam Johnson, senior lecturer in
                    publishing at Oxford Brookes University. "It will dent the
                    numbers a bit, but for those who are making money by
                    flooding the market with AI-generated books and publishing
                    more than three a day, they will find a work-around."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The new sets of rules come after Amazon removed
                    suspected AI-generated books that were falsely listed as
                    being written by the author Jane Friedman. Earlier this
                    month, books about mushroom foraging listed on Amazon were
                    reported as likely to have been AI-generated and therefore
                    containing potentially dangerous advice. AI-generated travel
                    books have also flooded the site.
                  </p>

                    The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has closed the
                    investigation into a mishap that occurred last September
                    during a launch of Blue Origin's New Shepard vehicle, with
                    the regulator saying that Blue must implement 21 corrective
                    actions before it can fly New Shepard again.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    >
                    about a minute after liftoff. The vehicle's capsule, which
                    was not filled with people, had to conduct an emergency
                    parachute landing to clear the booster. It landed safely
                    while the propulsion module was destroyed on impact with the
                    ground. There were no injuries to Blue Origin personnel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an emailed statement, a representative for the FAA said
                    the anomaly was caused by a "structural failure of an engine
                    nozzle caused by higher than expected engine operating
                    temperatures." Among the 21 corrective actions includes
                    redesigning the engine and nozzle components as well as
                    "organizational changes."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In response to TechCrunch's inquiries into the corrective
                    actions, a Blue Origin spokesperson simply said,
                    "We've received the FAA's letter and plan to fly soon."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The closure of the mishap investigation does not mean that
                    Blue Origin can immediately start flying New Shepard. The
                    company must implement all the corrective actions and
                    receive a launch license modification from the FAA first,
                    the FAA spokesperson said.

                    "structural relief" that would be "necessary to redress and

                    In the last days of the 1400s, a terrible epidemic swept
                    through Europe. Men and women spiked sudden fevers. Their
                    joints ached, and they broke out in rashes that ripened into
                    bursting boils. Ulcers ate away at their faces, collapsing
                    their noses and jaws, working down their throats and
                    airways, making it impossible to eat or drink. Survivors
                    were grossly disfigured. Unluckier victims died.

                    of a politically fractured landscape, from France into
                    Italy, on to Switzerland and Germany, and north to the
                    British Isles, Scandinavia, and Russia. The Holy Roman
                    Emperor declared it a punishment from God. “Nothing could be
                    more serious than this curse, this barbarian poison,” an
                    Italian historian wrote in 1495.

                    It seemed plausible that the great pox, later called
                    syphilis, might have journeyed with Spanish mercenaries, who
                    represented much of the army of Naples when France attacked
                    that kingdom in 1495. And it might have arrived in Spain
                    with the crews of Christopher Columbus, who returned there
                    in 1493 from the first of his exploratory voyages.

                    For most of the centuries since, a significant historical
                    narrative has blamed Columbus and his sailors for bringing
                    syphilis to Europe. It arrived as a ravaging plague and then
                    adapted to become a long-simmering disease that, before the
                    discovery of penicillin, could cripple people and drive them
                    mad. Investigating what’s called the “<a

                    >” has proved challenging: The symptoms related in old
                    accounts could describe several diseases, and the bacterium
                    that causes it, <i>Treponema pallidum</i>, was not
                    identified until 1905.

                    Provence in the 7th or 8th century. It’s the best evidence
                    yet that syphilis—or something related to it—was infecting
                    Europeans centuries before Columbus sailed.

                    syphilis were circulating in the European population before
                    Columbus,” says Michel Drancourt, a physician and professor
                    of microbiology at Aix-Marseille University, who led the
                    work published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. “So
                    far, this was a hypothesis in science and the medical

                    GPUs from all six of the major suppliers are vulnerable to a
                    newly discovered attack that allows malicious websites to
                    read the usernames, passwords, and other sensitive visual
                    data displayed by other websites, researchers have

                    The cross-origin attack allows a malicious website from one
                    domain—say, example.com—to effectively read the pixels
                    displayed by a website from example.org, or another
                    different domain. Attackers can then reconstruct them in a
                    way that allows them to view the words or images displayed
                    by the latter site. This leakage violates a critical
                    security principle that forms one of the most fundamental

                    them. We knew the reaction would be resoundingly negative,

                    [...] For their first generation of LPCAMM modules, Samsung
                    is looking as capacities of 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB, with data
                    rates up to LPDDR5X-7500. Samsung doesn’t currently have any
                    256Gbit LPDDR5X memory modules in their
                    <a
                      href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/dram/lpddr/lpddr5x/"
                      >catalog</a
                    >, so either the company has a way to fit 8 modules on to an
                    LPCAMM, or more likely they intend to introduce larger
                    memory modules by the time LPCAMMs ship next year. Otherwise
                    the data rate is a tier below Samsung’s best memory modules
                    (8533 MT/sec), but I wouldn’t be surprised to eventually
                    find out that it’s the trade-off for having modular LPDDR
                    memory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Samsung, they’ve already verified their LPCAMMs
                    with an unnamed Intel platform – almost certainly Raptor
                    Lake mobile, given the timing of the announcement. Though
                    nothing about LPCAMMs is vendor-specific, and if the form
                    factor is successful, I wouldn’t be surprised to see laptop
                    manufacturers also pick it up for AMD designs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For the moment, Samsung isn’t saying how LPCAMM
                    compares to soldered LPDDR5X memory with regards to size or
                    performance – it bigger and almost certainly a bit more
                    power hungry due to trace lengths. Otherwise, as a
                    replacement for SO-DIMMs, Samsung says that LPDDR5X LPCAMMs
                    only occupy 40% of the space of a DDR5 SO-DIMM, and improve
                    power efficiency by up to 70%, roughly in line with the
                    general benefit of LPDDR5X over LPDDR5.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But even with this newfound flexibility, don’t expect to see
                    LPCAMMs replace soldered LPDDR memory – at least not
                    wholesale. Besides the higher qualified speeds for a
                    soldered solution, LPCAMMs can’t match the smaller footprint
                    of a soldered solution, especially as vendors are starting
                    to put LPDDR memory directly on chip packages (i.e. Apple).
                    Depending on the cost of implementation, LPCAMMs may
                    displace soldered-on-motherboard memory, while ultraportable
                    devices will increasingly embrace soldered-on-package memory
                    to maximize space and efficiency.

                    Scientists said on Tuesday they have found the "missing
                    ingredient" for pink diamonds, some of the world's most
                    expensive stones due their rarity and beauty, and the
                    discovery could help find more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More than 90 percent of all the pink diamonds ever found
                    were discovered at the recently closed Argyle mine in the
                    remote northwest of Australia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But exactly why Argyle—which unlike most other diamond mines
                    does not sit in the middle of a continent but on the edge of
                    one—produced so many pink gems has remained a mystery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new study published in the journal
                    <i>Nature Communications</i>, a team of Australia-based
                    researchers said the pink diamonds were brought to the
                    Earth's surface by the break up of the first supercontinent
                    around 1.3 billion years ago.

                    state of Western Australia and the study's lead author, told
                    AFP that two of the three ingredients for forming pink
                    diamonds had already been known.

                Microsoft wants to become a nuclear power. Their need for power
                to power their AI and other things is now so great that they
                want to run their own nuclear reactors.

                    Nuclear energy doesn't create greenhouse gas emissions. Even
                    so, it could also open up a whole new can of worms when it
                    comes to handling radioactive waste and building up a
                    uranium supply chain. The role nuclear energy ought to play
                    in combatting climate change is still hotly debated, but
                    Microsoft co-founder, Bill Gates, has long been a big fan of
                    the technology.

                    Based on the new job listing, it looks like Microsoft is
                    betting on advanced nuclear reactors to be the answer. The
                    job posting says it's hiring someone to "lead project
                    initiatives for all aspects of nuclear energy infrastructure
                    for global growth."

              <p>
                Most of our light pollution comes from sources on the ground,
                but satellites don't just spoil deep-space astronomical
                observations when they cross a telescope's field of view; they
                also scatter and reflect sunlight from their solar arrays. The
                abundance of satellites is causing the overall brightness of the
                sky to increase all around the globe. Some researchers have
                estimated that, on average, our darkest night skies, located in
                the most remote regions of the world, are 10% brighter than they
                were a half century ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                Humans are ineffably impacted. How can someone who has never
                seen a clear night sky know what they are missing? It's like
                someone without gonads or genital nerves trying to understand
                orgasm.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many animal species are suffering as well. What good are
                night-adapted senses in nocturnal species if the night sky isn't
                much darker than the daytime sky? Researchers have identified
                several species whose circadian rhythms are getting thrown off,
                making them vulnerable to predation (or, the reverse: the
                inability to effectively locate prey).

                    Amazon announced today that Prime Video users in the US,
                    Canada, Germany, and the UK will automatically start seeing
                    advertisements "in early 2024." Subscribers will receive a
                    notification email "several weeks" in advance, at which
                    point they can opt to pay $2.99 extra for ad-free Prime
                    Video, Amazon said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That takes the price of ad-free Prime Video from $8.99/month
                    alone to $11.98/month and from $14.99/month with Prime to
                    $17.98/month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Prime Video subscribers who don't pay the extra $2.99
                    (and don't just cancel their subscription altogether) are
                    promised "meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other
                    streaming TV providers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] With current prices starting at $9.99 per month, Prime
                    Video was one of the cheapest ways to get streaming TV
                    without ads. While the changes put pricing for ad-free Prime
                    Video more on par with its competitors, it may still
                    disappoint budget-minded cord-cutters.

                    influx in services, changes in pricing, confusing bundles,
                    and scattered content have proven, we haven't gotten that

                    The dreaded rat lungworm—a parasite with a penchant for rats
                    and slugs that occasionally finds itself rambling and
                    writhing in human brains—has firmly established itself in
                    the Southeast US and will likely continue its rapid
                    invasion,
                    <a
                      href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/10/23-0706_article"

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study involved small-scale surveillance of dead rats in
                    the Atlanta zoo. Between 2019 and 2022, researchers
                    continually turned up evidence of the worm. In all, the
                    study identified seven out of 33 collected rats (21 percent)
                    with evidence of a rat lungworm infection. The infected
                    animals were spread throughout the study's time frame, all
                    in different months, with one in 2019, three in 2021, and
                    three in 2022, indicating sustained transmission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although small, the study "suggests that the zoonotic
                    parasite was introduced to and has become established in a
                    new area of the southeastern United States," the study's
                    authors, led by researchers at the University of Georgia
                    College of Veterinary Medicine, concluded. The study was
                    published Wednesday in the journal Emerging Infectious
                    Diseases.

                    [...] When a rat lungworm finds itself in a human, it does
                    what it usually does in rats—it heads to the central nervous
                    system and brain. Sometimes the migration of the worms to
                    the central nervous system is asymptomatic or only causes
                    mild transient symptoms. But, sometimes, they cause severe
                    neurological dysfunction. This can start with nonspecific
                    symptoms like headache, light sensitivity, and insomnia and
                    develop into neck stiffness and pain, tingling or burning of
                    the skin, double vision, bowel or bladder difficulties, and
                    seizures. In severe cases, it can cause nerve damage,
                    paralysis, coma, and even death.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's often thought that the worm can't complete its life
                    cycle in humans and that it ends up idly

                    before it's eventually killed off by immune responses.
                    However, there has been some evidence of adult worms
                    reaching the human lungs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Regardless, there's no specific treatment for a rat lungworm
                    infection. No anti-parasitic drugs have proven effective,
                    and, in fact, there's some evidence they can make symptoms
                    worse by spurring more immune responses to dying worms. For
                    now, supportive treatment, pain medications, and steroids
                    are typically the only options.

                The BBC reports that Lego won't be making blocks from recycled

                It appears they did a full depth study over the last two years,

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Currently, many of Lego's bricks are made using
                    acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a virgin plastic made
                    from crude oil.<br />...<br />In 2021, it said it has
                    developed prototype bricks made from polyethylene
                    terephthalate (PET) bottles, with some other chemicals
                    added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The hope was that material could have offered an alternative
                    to oil-based bricks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Lego has now revealed that after more than two years of
                    testing, it had found that using recycled PET didn't reduce
                    carbon emissions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It said the reason for that was because extra steps were
                    required in the production process, which meant it needed to
                    use more energy.

                      * Good for Lego to come clean and not continue with
                "greenwashing".<br />
                      * What's wrong with wooden blocks anyway? I really enjoyed
                mine. They didn't lock me into a fixed attachment the way that
                Lego does. Don't be square (aka boring)!

                    GWASs are a crucial tool in science, but they have their
                    limitations. Importantly, they can only find correlations
                    between a variant and a disease or trait. So more research
                    will be needed to confirm a causal relationship between this
                    newly discovered mutation and Parkinson’s and to learn how
                    it might be causing the disease. But GWASs are often
                    intended to provide scientists with new clues to track down.
                    And the authors say their research offers a clear example of
                    why it’s so important to include a wide array of people in
                    these studies.

                    flea biology enabled us to pioneer a nature-inspired
                    tertiary wastewater treatment technology. This refines

                    "The water flea's remarkable ability to remain dormant for
                    centuries allows scientists to revive dormant populations
                    that endured varying historical pollution pressures.
                    Leveraging this trait, researchers sourced strains with
                    diverse tolerances to chemical pollutants, incorporating
                    them into the technology."

                    Co-author Dr. Mohamed Abdallah, from the University of

                    for irrigation, industrial applications, and household use.
                    By preventing persistent chemicals from entering waterways,

                    Co-author Professor Karl Dearn, also from the School of

                    these remarkable water fleas into custom containment devices
                    to refine effluent before its final release. Once in place,
                    our technology largely maintains itself, attributed to the
                    water fleas' clonal reproduction capability."

                    technology provides a potentially revolutionary process for
                    sustainably removing persistent chemical pollutants from
                    wastewater. By preventing these chemicals from being
                    discharged, we can protect our environment and

                    Back in the late 1970s, the most popular memory chip was
                    Mostek's MK4116, holding a whopping (for the time) 16
                    kilobits. It provided storage for computers such as the
                    Apple II, TRS-80, ZX Spectrum, Commodore PET, IBM PC, and
                    Xerox Alto as well as video games such as Defender and
                    Missile Command. To see how the chip is implemented I opened
                    one up and reverse-engineered it. I expected the circuitry
                    to be similar to other chips of the era, using standard NMOS
                    gates, but it was much more complex than I expected, built
                    from low-power dynamic logic. The MK4116 also used advanced
                    manufacturing processes to fit 16,384 high-density memory
                    cells on the chip.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In dynamic RAM, each bit is stored in a capacitor with
                    the bit's value, 0 or 1, represented by the voltage on the
                    capacitor.3 The advantage of dynamic RAM is that each memory
                    cell is very small, so a lot of data can be stored on one
                    chip.4 The downside of dynamic RAM is that the charge on a
                    capacitor leaks away after a few milliseconds. To avoid
                    losing data, dynamic RAM must be constantly refreshed: bits
                    are read from the capacitors, amplified, and then written
                    back to the capacitors. For the MK4116, all the data must be
                    refreshed every two milliseconds.

                    Daily insulin injections are painful and inconvenient, which
                    is why scientists are developing
                    <a

                    without any need for needles. A new one looks particularly
                    promising, as it produces oxygen to feed onboard islet
                    cells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] One alternative to those injections involves
                    implanting islet cells that have either been harvested from
                    a cadaver or derived from stem cells. While doing so does
                    work in many cases, patients have to take immunosuppressive
                    drugs for the rest of their lives in order to keep those
                    cells from being rejected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists have tried encapsulating islet cells in tiny
                    flexible implants that shield the cells from the host's
                    immune system, yet still allow insulin produced by those
                    cells to diffuse into the bloodstream. These implants also
                    prevent life-sustaining oxygen from reaching the cells,
                    however, which means those cells won't last long.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some implants have addressed that shortcoming by
                    incorporating either a preloaded oxygen chamber or chemical
                    reagents which produce oxygen. Both the oxygen and the
                    reagents run out over time, though, so the implants will
                    have to be replaced or refilled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Seeking a longer-term alternative, a team from MIT and
                    Boston Children's Hospital recently developed the new
                    device.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's packed with hundreds of thousands of islet cells, along
                    with a proton-exchange membrane that splits water vapor
                    (which occurs naturally in the body) into hydrogen and
                    oxygen. The hydrogen harmlessly diffuses, while the oxygen
                    goes into a storage chamber in the implant. A thin,
                    permeable membrane in that chamber then allows the oxygen to
                    flow through to the chamber containing the islet cells.
